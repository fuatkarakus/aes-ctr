     CHAPTER
" I

“Well, P"
"rince, so Genoa "
and Lucca are no
w just family es
tates of the Bu
onapartes. But I
" warn you, if yo"
u don’t tell m
e that this mean
"s war,
if you s"
till try to defe
nd the infamies 
and horrors perp
etrated by that 
 Antichrist—I 
really believe h
e is Antichrist�
��I will have no
thing more to d
o with you and y
ou are no longer
" my friend, no l"
onger my ‘fai
"thful slave,’ "
as you call your
self! But how do
 you do? I see I
 have frightene
d you—sit down
 and tell me all
 the news.”  
"
It was in July,"
" 1805, and the s"
peaker was the w
ell-known Anna P
ávlovna Schér
"er, maid of hono"
r and favorite o
f the Empress M�
�rya Fëdorovna.
 With these wor
ds she greeted P
rince Vasíli Ku
"rágin, a man of"
 high rank and 
"importance, who "
was the first to
 arrive at her r
eception. Anna 
Pávlovna had ha
d a cough for so
me days. She was
", as she said, s"
uffering from l
a grippe; grippe
 being then a ne
w word in St. Pe
"tersburg, used
"
only by the elit
e.  All her in
vitations withou
"t exception, wri"
"tten in French, "
and delivered b
y a scarlet-live
ried footman tha
"t morning, ran a"
s follows:  �
�If you have not
hing better to d
"o, Count (or Pri"
"nce), and if the"
 prospect of sp
ending an evenin
g with a poor in
valid is not too
" terrible,
I sh"
all be very char
med to see you t
onight between 7
 and 10—Annett
e Schérer.” 
  “Heavens! w
hat a virulent a
ttack!” replie
"d the prince, no"
t in the least 
disconcerted by 
this reception. 
He had just ente
"red, wearing an"
 embroidered cou
"rt uniform, knee"
" breeches, and s"
"hoes, and had st"
ars on his brea
st and a serene 
expression on hi
s flat face. He 
spoke in that r
efined French in
 which our grand
fathers not only
 spoke but thoug
"ht, and
with th"
"e gentle, patron"
izing intonation
 natural to a ma
n of importance 
 who had grown o
ld in society an
d at court. He w
ent up to Anna P
"ávlovna,
kisse"
"d her hand, pres"
enting to her hi
"s bald, scented,"
 and shining hea
"d,
and complace"
ntly seated hims
elf on the sofa.
  “First of 
"all, dear friend"
", tell me how yo"
u are. Set your 
friend’s mind
" at rest,” sai"
d he without alt
"ering his tone, "
beneath the pol
iteness and affe
cted sympathy of
 which indiffere
nce and even iro
ny could be dis
cerned.  “Ca
n one be well wh
ile suffering mo
rally? Can one b
e calm in times 
 like these if o
ne has any feeli
ng?” said Anna
 Pávlovna. “Y
ou are staying 
the whole evenin
"g, I hope?”
"
 “And the fete
 at the English 
ambassador’s? 
Today is Wednesd
ay. I must put 
in an appearance
" there,” said "
the prince. “M
y daughter is c
oming for me to 
take me there.�
�  “I though
t today’s fete
 had been cancel
ed. I confess al
l these festivi
ties and firewor
ks are becoming 
wearisome.”  
 “If they had 
known that you w
"ished it, the en"
tertainment woul
d have been put
" off,” said th"
"e prince, who, l"
ike a wound-up c
"lock, by force
"
of habit said th
ings he did not 
even wish to be 
believed.  “
Don’t tease! W
"ell, and what ha"
s been decided a
bout Novosíltse
v’s dispatch?
 You know everyt
hing.”  “W
hat can one say 
about it?” rep
lied the prince 
"in a cold, listl"
ess tone. “Wh
at has been deci
ded? They have d
ecided that Buon
aparte has burn
"t his boats, and"
 I believe that 
we are ready to 
burn ours.”  
 Prince Vasíli 
always spoke lan
"guidly, like an "
actor repeating 
a stale part. A
nna Pávlovna Sc
hérer on the co
"ntrary, despite "
"her forty years,"
 overflowed wit
h animation and 
impulsiveness. T
o be an enthusia
st had become h
er social vocati
"on and, sometime"
s even when she 
did not feel li
"ke it, she becam"
e enthusiastic i
n order not to d
isappoint the e
xpectations of t
hose who knew he
r. The subdued s
"mile which, thou"
gh it did not s
uit her faded fe
"atures, always p"
layed round her 
"lips expressed,"
 as in a spoiled
" child, a contin"
ual consciousnes
s of her charmin
"g defect,
which"
 she neither wis
"hed, nor could, "
nor considered i
"t necessary, to"
 correct.  In 
the midst of a c
onversation on p
olitical matters
 Anna Pávlovna 
burst out:  �
"��Oh, don’t sp"
eak to me of Aus
tria. Perhaps I 
don’t understa
"nd
things, but "
Austria never ha
"s wished, and do"
"es not wish, for"
 war. She is be
traying us! Russ
ia alone must sa
ve Europe. Our g
racious sovereig
n recognizes hi
s high vocation 
and will be true
 to it. That is 
the one thing I
 have faith in! 
Our good and won
derful sovereign
 has to perform 
 the noblest rol
"e on earth, and "
he is so virtuou
s and noble that
 God will not f
orsake him. He w
ill fulfill his 
vocation and cru
sh the hydra of 
"
revolution, whi"
ch has become mo
re terrible than
 ever in the per
son of this mur
derer and villai
n! We alone must
 avenge the bloo
d of the just o
"ne.... Whom, I a"
"sk you, can we r"
ely on?... Engla
nd with her comm
ercial spirit w
ill not and cann
ot understand th
e Emperor Alexan
der’s loftine
ss of soul. She 
has refused to e
vacuate Malta. S
he wanted to fi
"nd, and still se"
"eks, some secret"
 motive in our a
ctions. What ans
wer did Novosí
ltsev get? None.
 The English hav
e not understood
 and cannot und
erstand the self
-abnegation of o
ur Emperor who w
ants nothing for
"
himself, but o"
nly desires the 
good of mankind.
 And what have t
hey promised? N
othing! And what
 little they hav
e promised they 
will not perfor
m! Prussia has a
lways declared t
hat Buonaparte i
"s invincible, an"
d that all Euro
pe is powerless 
before him.... A
nd I don’t bel
ieve a word tha
t Hardenburg say
"s, or Haugwitz e"
ither. This famo
us Prussian neu
trality is just 
a trap. I have f
aith only in God
 and the lofty 
destiny of our a
dored monarch. H
e will save Euro
pe!”  She su
"ddenly paused, s"
miling at her ow
n impetuosity. 
"
“I think,”"
 said the prince
" with a smile, �"
��that if you ha
d been sent ins
tead of our dear
 Wintzingerode y
ou would have ca
ptured the King 
 of Prussia’s 
consent by assau
lt. You are so e
loquent. Will yo
u give me a cup
 of tea?”  �
��In a moment. �
"� propos,” she"
" added, becoming"
" calm again, “"
I am expecting 
two very interes
ting men tonight
", le Vicomte de "
"Mortemart, who
"
is connected wit
h the Montmorenc
ys through the R
"ohans, one of th"
e best French f
amilies. He is o
ne of the genuin
"e émigrés, the"
 good ones. And 
 also the Abbé 
Morio. Do you kn
ow that profound
 thinker? He has
 been received 
by the Emperor. 
Had you heard?�
�  “I shall 
be delighted to 
"meet them,” sa"
id the prince. �
"��But
tell me,�"
�� he added with
 studied careles
sness as if it h
ad only just oc
"curred to him, t"
hough the questi
on he was about 
to ask was the c
hief motive of 
"his visit, “is"
 it true that th
e Dowager Empres
s wants Baron F
unke to be appoi
nted first secre
tary at Vienna? 
The baron by all
 accounts is a 
poor creature.�
�  Prince Vas�
�li wished to ob
tain this post f
"or his son, but "
others were try
ing through the 
Dowager Empress 
Márya Fëdorovn
a to secure it f
or the baron. 
 Anna Pávlovna
 almost closed h
er eyes to indic
ate that neither
 she nor anyone
 else had a righ
t to criticize w
hat the Empress 
desired or was 
pleased with.  
 “Baron Funke 
has been recomme
nded to the Dowa
ger Empress by h
"er
sister,” w"
"as all she said,"
 in a dry and mo
urnful tone.  
As she named the
" Empress, Anna P"
ávlovna’s fac
e suddenly assum
ed an expressio
n of profound an
d sincere devoti
on and respect m
ingled with sad
"ness, and this o"
ccurred every ti
me she mentioned
 her illustrious
 patroness. She
 added that Her 
Majesty had deig
ned to show Baro
n Funke beaucou
"p d’estime, an"
d again her face
 clouded over wi
th sadness.  T
he prince was si
lent and looked 
indifferent. But
", with the woman"
ly and courtier
like quickness a
nd tact habitual
" to her, Anna P�"
�vlovna wished 
both to rebuke h
im (for daring t
o speak as he ha
d done of a man 
 recommended to 
the Empress) and
 at the same tim
e to console him
", so she
said:"
  “Now about 
your family. Do 
you know that si
nce your daughte
r came out ever
yone has been en
raptured by her?
 They say she is
 amazingly beau
tiful.”  The
 prince bowed to
 signify his res
pect and gratitu
de.  “I ofte
"n think,” she "
continued after 
"a short pause, d"
rawing nearer t
o the prince and
 smiling amiably
 at him as if to
 show that polit
ical and social
 topics were end
ed and the time 
had come for int
imate conversat
ion—“I often
 think how unfai
rly sometimes th
e joys of life 
are distributed.
 Why has fate gi

 splendid childr
en? I don’t s
"peak of Anatole,"
 your youngest. 
I don’t like h
"im,” she
adde"
d in a tone admi
tting of no rejo
inder and raisin
g her eyebrows. 
 “Two such cha
rming children. 
And really you a
ppreciate them l
ess than anyone
", and so you don"
’t deserve to 
have them.”  
 And she smiled

"��t help it,” "
said the prince.
 “Lavater woul
d have said I l
ack the bump of 
paternity.”  
 “Don’t joke
; I mean to have
 a serious talk 
with you. Do you
 know I am diss
atisfied with yo
ur younger son? 
Between ourselve
s” (and her f
ace assumed its 
melancholy expre

s mentioned at H
er Majesty’s 
and you were pit

e prince answere
"d nothing, but s"
he looked at him
" significantly,"
 awaiting a repl

 “What would 
you have me do?�
�� he said at la
st. “You know 
I did all a fat

nd they have bot

the only differe

.” He said thi
s smiling in a w
ay more natural
 and animated th
"an usual, so tha"
t the wrinkles r
ound his mouth 
very clearly rev
ealed something 
unexpectedly coa
rse and unpleas

born to such men
 as you? If you 
were not a fath

"a
Pávlovna, lo"
oking up pensive

 of my life. It 
is the cross I h
ave to bear. Tha
t is how I expl
ain it to myself
. It can’t be 
helped!”  He
" said no more, b"
ut expressed his
 resignation to 
cruel fate by a 
 gesture. Anna P
ávlovna meditat
ed.  “Have y
ou never thought
 of marrying you
r prodigal son A
natole?” she 
asked. “They s
ay old maids hav
e a mania for ma
"tchmaking, and t"
hough I don’t

ess in myself as
" yet, I know a l"
ittle person who
 is very unhapp

rincess Mary Bo

 Prince Vasíli
" did not reply, "
"though, with the"
 quickness of me
mory and percep
tion befitting a
 man of the worl
"d, he indicated "
by a movement of
 the head that 
he was consideri
ng this informat

"u know,” he sa"
"id at last, evid"
ently unable to 
check the sad c
urrent of his th
"oughts, “that "
Anatole is costi

sand rubles a y
"ear? And,” he "
went on after a 
"pause, “what w"
ill it be in fi

goes on like thi

he added: “Tha
t’s what we f

��  “Her fat

“Listen, dear"

     CHAPTER
 II  Anna Páv
lovna’s drawin
g room was gradu
ally filling. Th
e highest Peter
sburg society wa
s assembled ther
e: people differ
ing widely in ag
e and character
 but alike in th
e social circle 
to which they be
longed. Prince 
Vasíli’s daug
"hter, the beauti"
"ful Hélène, ca"
me to take her 
father to the am
bassador’s ent
ertainment; she 
wore a ball dres
s and her badge
 as maid of hono
r. The youthful 
little Princess 
"Bolkónskaya,
k"
nown as la femme
 la plus séduis
ante de Pétersb
"ourg, * was also"
 there. She had
 been married du
ring the previou
"s winter, and be"
ing pregnant did
 not go to any 
large gatherings
", but only to sm"
all receptions. 
Prince Vasíli�
"��s son, Hippoly"
"te, had come wit"
"h Mortemart, who"
m he introduced.
 The Abbé Mori
o and many other
s had also come.
       * The m
ost fascinating 
woman in Petersb
urg.  To each 
new arrival Anna
" Pávlovna said,"
 “You have not
 yet seen my au
"nt,” or “You"
 do not know my 
aunt?” and ver
y gravely conduc
ted him or her 
to a little old 
"lady, wearing la"
rge bows of ribb
"on in her
cap, "
who had come sai
ling in from ano
ther room as soo
n as the guests 
 began to arrive
; and slowly tur
ning her eyes fr
om the visitor t
"o her
aunt, Ann"
a Pávlovna ment
ioned each one�
�s name and then
 left them.  E
ach visitor perf
ormed the ceremo
ny of greeting t
his old aunt who
m not one of th
"em knew, not one"
 of them wanted 
"to know, and not"
 one of them ca
red about; Anna 
Pávlovna observ
ed these greetin
gs with mournful
 and solemn int
erest and silent
 approval. The a
unt spoke to eac
h of them in th
"e same words, ab"
out their health
" and her own, an"
d the health of 
"Her
Majesty, �"
"�who, thank God,"
 was better toda
y.” And each v
"isitor,
though "
politeness preve
nted his showing
" impatience, lef"
t the old woman 
 with a sense of
 relief at havin
g performed a ve
xatious duty and
 did not return
 to her the whol
e evening.  Th
e young Princess
 Bolkónskaya ha
d brought some w
ork in a gold-e
mbroidered velve
t bag. Her prett
y little upper l
"ip, on which a
"
delicate dark do
wn was just perc
"eptible, was too"
 short for her t
"eeth,
but it li"
fted all the mor
"e sweetly, and w"
as especially ch
arming when she 
 occasionally dr
ew it down to me
et the lower lip
. As is always t
he case with a 
thoroughly attra
"ctive woman, her"
 defect—the sh
ortness of her 
upper lip and he
r half-open mout
h—seemed to be
 her own special
 and peculiar f
orm of beauty. E
veryone brighten
ed at the sight 
of this pretty 
"young woman, so "
soon to become a
" mother, so full"
 of life and hea
"lth, and
carryi"
ng her burden so
 lightly. Old me
n and dull dispi
rited young ones
 who looked at 
"her, after being"
 in her company 
and talking to h
er a little whi
"le, felt as if t"
hey too were bec
"oming, like her,"
 full of life a
nd health. All w
ho talked to her
", and at each wo"
rd saw her brigh
t smile and the
 constant gleam 
of her white tee
"th, thought that"
 they were in a 
 specially amiab
le mood that day
.  The little 
princess went ro
und the table wi
"th quick, short,"
" swaying
steps,"
 her workbag on 
"her arm, and gai"
ly spreading out
 her dress sat 
down on a sofa n
ear the silver s
"amovar, as if al"
l she was doing 
was a pleasure 
to herself and t
o all around her
. “I have brou
"ght my work,”"
 said she in Fre
"nch, displaying "
her bag and addr
essing all prese
"nt.
“Mind, An"
"nette, I hope yo"
u have not playe
d a wicked trick
" on me,”
she "
"added, turning t"
o her hostess. �
��You wrote that
 it was to be qu
ite a small rec
"eption, and just"
 see how badly I
 am dressed.” 
And she spread 
out her arms to 
show her short-w
"aisted, lace-tri"
"mmed, dainty gra"
"y
dress, girdle"
d with a broad r
ibbon just below
 the breast.  
“Soyez tranqui
"lle, Lise, you w"
ill always be pr
ettier than anyo
"ne
else,” rep"
lied Anna Pávlo
vna.  “You k
"now,” said the"
 princess in the
 same tone of vo
ice and still in
"
French, turnin"
"g to a general, "
“my husband is
 deserting me? H
e is going to g
et himself kille
d. Tell me what 
this wretched wa
r is for?” she
"
added, address"
ing Prince Vasí
"li, and without "
waiting for an a
nswer she turne
d to speak to hi
"s daughter, the "
beautiful Hélè
ne.  “What a
 delightful woma
n this little pr
incess is!” sa
id Prince Vasí
li to Anna Pávl
ovna.  One of 
the next arrival
"s was a stout, h"
eavily built you
ng man with clo
"se-cropped hair,"
" spectacles, the"
 light-colored b
reeches fashiona
ble at that tim
"e, a very high r"
"uffle, and a bro"
wn dress coat. T
his stout young
 man was an ille
gitimate son of 
"Count Bezúkhov,"
 a well-known g
randee of Cather
ine’s time who
 now lay dying i
n Moscow. The yo
ung man had not
 yet entered eit
her the military
 or civil servic
"e, as he had onl"
y just returned
 from abroad whe
re he had been e
"ducated, and thi"
s was his first
 appearance in s
ociety. Anna Pá
vlovna greeted h
im with the nod 
she accorded to
 the lowest hier
archy in her dra
wing room. But i
n spite of this
 lowest-grade gr
"eeting, a look o"
f anxiety and fe
"ar, as at the si"
ght of somethin
g too large and 
unsuited to the 
"place, came over"
 her face when 
she saw Pierre e
nter. Though he 
was certainly ra
ther bigger than
 the other men 
"in the room, her"
 anxiety could o
nly have referen
ce to the cleve
"r though shy, bu"
t observant and 
"natural, express"
ion which disti
nguished him fro
m everyone else 
in that drawing 
room.  “It i
s very good of y
"ou, Monsieur Pie"
"rre, to come and"
 visit a poor i
"nvalid,” said "
"Anna Pávlovna, "
exchanging an al
armed glance wit
h her aunt as s
he conducted him
 to her.  Pier
re murmured some
thing unintellig
"ible, and contin"
ued to look roun
d as if in sear
ch of something.
 On his way to t
he aunt he bowed
 to the little 
princess with a 
"pleased smile, a"
s to an intimate
 acquaintance. 
 Anna Pávlovna
’s alarm was j
"ustified, for Pi"
erre turned away
 from the aunt 
without waiting 
to hear her spee
ch about Her Maj
esty’s health.
 Anna Pávlovna
 in dismay detai
ned him with the
 words: “Do yo
u know the Abb�
� Morio? He is a
 most interestin
g man.”  “
"Yes, I have hear"
d of his scheme 
for perpetual pe
"ace, and it is v"
ery interesting
 but hardly feas
ible.”  “Y
ou think so?” 
rejoined Anna P�
�vlovna in order
 to say somethin
g and get away 
to attend to her
 duties as hoste
ss. But Pierre n
ow committed a 
reverse act of i
mpoliteness. Fir
st he had left a
 lady before sh
e had finished s
"peaking to him, "
and now he conti
nued to speak to
 another who wi
shed to get away
. With his head 
"bent, and his bi"
g feet spread a
"part, he began e"
xplaining his re
asons for thinki
ng the abbé’s
 plan chimerica
l.  “We will
 talk of it late
"r,” said Anna "
Pávlovna with a
 smile.  And h
aving got rid of
 this young man 
who did not know
" how to behave, "
she resumed her
 duties as hoste
ss and continued
 to listen and w
"atch, ready
to "
help at any poin
t where the conv
ersation might h
appen to flag. A
s the foreman o
f a spinning mil
"l, when he has s"
et the hands to 
"work, goes
roun"
d and notices he
re a spindle tha
t has stopped or
 there one that 
 creaks or makes
 more noise than
" it should, and "
hastens to check
 the machine or
 set it in prope
"r motion, so Ann"
a Pávlovna move
d about her dra
"wing room, appro"
aching now a sil
"ent, now a too-n"
"oisy group, and "
by a word or sl
ight rearrangeme
nt kept the conv
ersational machi
"ne in steady,
p"
"roper, and regul"
ar motion. But a
mid these cares 
her anxiety abou
t Pierre was ev
ident. She kept 
an anxious watch
 on him when he 
approached the 
group round Mort
emart to listen 
to what was bein
"g said there, an"
d again when he
 passed to anoth
er group whose c
enter was the ab
bé.  Pierre h
ad been educated
" abroad, and thi"
s reception at A
nna Pávlovna�
�s was the first
 he had attended
 in Russia. He k
new that all th
e intellectual l
ights of Petersb
urg were gathere
"d there and, lik"
e a child in a 
"toyshop, did not"
 know which way 
"to look, afraid "
of missing any 
clever conversat
ion that was to 
be heard. Seeing
 the self-confid
ent and refined
 expression on t
he faces of thos
e present he was
 always expecti
ng to hear somet
hing very profou
nd. At last he c
ame up to Morio.
 Here the conve
rsation seemed i
nteresting and h
e stood waiting 
for an opportun
ity to express h
"is own views, as"
 young people ar
e fond of doing.
      CHAP
TER III  Anna 
Pávlovna’s re
ception was in f
ull swing. The s
pindles hummed 
steadily and cea
selessly on all 
sides. With the 
exception of the
" aunt,
beside w"
hom sat only one
" elderly lady, w"
ho with her thin
 careworn face 
was rather out o
f place in this 
brilliant societ
"y, the whole com"
pany had settle
d into three gro
"ups. One, chiefl"
"y masculine, had"
 formed round t
he abbé. Anothe
"r, of young peop"
"le, was grouped "
round the beauti
ful Princess H�
"�lène, Prince V"
asíli’s daugh
"ter, and the lit"
tle Princess Bo
"lkónskaya, very"
 pretty and rosy
", though rather "
too plump for he
r age. The thir
d group was gath
ered round Morte
mart and Anna P�
�vlovna.  The 
vicomte was a ni
ce-looking young
 man with soft f
eatures and poli
"shed
manners, w"
ho evidently con
sidered himself 
a celebrity but 
out of politene
ss modestly plac
ed himself at th
e disposal of th
e circle in whi
ch he found hims
elf. Anna Pávlo
vna was obviousl
y serving him up
 as a treat to 
her guests. As a
 clever maître 
d’hôtel serve
s up as a speci
ally choice deli
cacy a piece of 
meat that no one
 who had seen it
 in the kitchen
 would have care
"d to eat, so Ann"
a Pávlovna serv
ed up to her gu
"ests, first the "
vicomte and then
" the abbé, as p"
eculiarly choice
 morsels. The g
roup about Morte
mart immediately
 began discussin
g the murder of
 the Duc d’Eng
hien. The vicomt
e said that the 
Duc d’Enghien 
 had perished by
 his own magnani
"mity, and that t"
here were partic
ular reasons fo
r Buonaparte’s
 hatred of him. 
"

“Ah, yes! D"
o tell us all ab
"out it, Vicomte,"
” said Anna P�
"�vlovna,
with a"
 pleasant feelin
g that there was
 something à la
 Louis XV in the
 sound of that 
sentence: “Con
"tez nous çela, "
Vicomte.”  T
he vicomte bowed
 and smiled cour
teously in token
 of his willingn
ess to comply. 
Anna Pávlovna a
rranged a group 
"round him, invit"
ing everyone to 
 listen to his t
ale.  “The v
icomte knew the 
"duc personally,�"
�� whispered Ann
a Pávlovna to 
one of the guest
s. “The vicomt
e is a wonderful
" raconteur,” s"
aid she to anot
her. “How evid
ently he belongs
 to the best soc
"iety,” said sh"
e to a third; a
nd the vicomte w
as served up to 
the company in t
he choicest and
 most advantageo
"us style, like a"
 well-garnished 
joint of roast b
eef on a hot di
sh.  The vicom
te wished to beg
in his story and
 gave a subtle s
mile.  “Come
" over here, Hél"
"ène, dear,” s"
aid Anna Pávlov
na to the beaut
iful young princ
ess who was sitt
ing some way off
", the center of"
 another group. 
  The princess 
smiled. She rose
 with the same u
nchanging smile 
with which she 
had first entere
d the room—the
 smile of a perf
ectly beautiful 
 woman. With a s
light rustle of 
her white dress 
trimmed with mos
"s
and ivy, with"
 a gleam of whit
"e shoulders, glo"
"ssy hair, and sp"
arkling diamond
"s, she passed be"
tween the men wh
o made way for h
"er, not looking"
 at any of them 
but smiling on a
"ll, as if gracio"
usly allowing ea
ch the privileg
e of admiring he
r beautiful figu
re and shapely s
"houlders,
back,"
 and bosom—whi
ch in the fashio
n of those days 
were very much 
exposed—and sh
e seemed to brin
g the glamour of
 a ballroom with
 her as she mov
ed toward Anna P
ávlovna. Hélè
ne was so lovely
 that not only 
did she not show
 any trace of co
"quetry, but on t"
he contrary she 
even appeared s
hy of her unques
tionable and all
 too victorious 
beauty. She see
"med to wish, but"
" to be unable, t"
o diminish its e
ffect.  “How
 lovely!” said
 everyone who sa
w her; and the v
icomte lifted hi
s shoulders and
 dropped his eye
s as if startled
 by something ex
traordinary whe
n she took her s
eat opposite and
 beamed upon him
 also with her 
unchanging smile
".

“Madame, "
I doubt my abili
ty before such a
"n audience,” s"
"aid he,
smiling"
ly inclining his
 head.  The pr
incess rested he
r bare round arm
 on a little tab
le and considere
d a reply unnec
essary. She smil
ingly waited. Al
l the time the s
tory was being 
told she sat upr
"ight, glancing n"
ow at her beauti
"ful round arm,
"
altered in shape
 by its pressure
" on the table, n"
ow at her still 
more beautiful 
"bosom, on which "
she readjusted a
 diamond necklac
e. From time to
 time she smooth
ed the folds of 
"her dress, and w"
henever the stor
y produced an e
ffect she glance
d at Anna Pávlo
"vna, at once ado"
pted just the e
xpression she sa
w on the maid of
" honor’s face,"
 and again relap
sed into her ra
diant smile.  
The little princ
ess had also lef
t the tea table 
and followed Hé
lène.  “Wai
"t a moment, I’"
ll get my work..
".. Now then, wha"
t are you think
ing of?” she w
"ent on, turning "
to Prince Hippol
yte. “Fetch me
 my workbag.”
  There was a 
general movement
 as the princess
", smiling and ta"
lking merrily t
o everyone at on
"ce, sat down and"
 gaily arranged 
herself in her 
seat.  “Now 
"I am all right,�"
"�� she said, and"
 asking the vico
"mte to begin, sh"
e took up her w
ork.  Prince H
"ippolyte, having"
 brought the wor
"kbag, joined the"
 circle and mov
ing a chair clos
e to hers seated
 himself beside 
her.  Le charm
ant Hippolyte wa
s surprising by 
his extraordinar
y resemblance t
o his beautiful 
"sister, but yet "
more by the fact
 that in spite o
f this resembla
nce he was excee
dingly ugly. His
 features were l
ike his sister�
"��s, but while i"
n her case every
thing was lit up
" by a joyous,
s"
"elf-satisfied, y"
"outhful, and con"
stant smile of a
"nimation, and by"
 the wonderful 
classic beauty o
"f her figure, hi"
s face on the co
ntrary was dull
ed by imbecility
 and a constant 
expression of su
llen self-confi
"dence, while his"
 body was thin a
nd weak. His eye
"s, nose, and
mo"
uth all seemed p
uckered into a v
"acant, wearied g"
"rimace, and his "
arms and legs a
lways fell into 
unnatural positi
ons.  “It’
s not going to b
e a ghost story?
"” said he, sit"
ting down beside
 the princess a
nd hastily adjus
ting his lorgnet
"te, as if withou"
t this instrume
nt he could not 
begin to speak. 
"

“Why no, my"
" dear fellow,”"
 said the astoni
"shed narrator, s"
hrugging his sh
oulders.  “B
ecause I hate gh
"ost stories,” "
said Prince Hipp
olyte in a tone 
 which showed th
at he only under
stood the meanin
g of his words a
fter he had utt
ered them.  He
 spoke with such
 self-confidence
 that his hearer
s could not be s
ure whether wha
t he said was ve
ry witty or very
 stupid. He was 
dressed in a da
rk-green dress c
"oat, knee breech"
es of the color 
of cuisse de nym
"phe
effrayée, "
"as he called it,"
" shoes, and silk"
 stockings.  T
he vicomte told 
his tale very ne
atly. It was an 
"anecdote, then c"
"urrent,
to the "
effect that the 
Duc d’Enghien 
had gone secretl
y to Paris to v
isit Mademoisell
e George; that a
t her house he c
ame upon Bonapar
"te,
who also en"
joyed the famous
 actress’ favo
"rs, and that in "
his presence Na
poleon happened 
to fall into one
 of the fainting
 fits to which h
"e was
subject, "
and was thus at 
the duc’s merc
y. The latter sp
"ared him, and
t"
his magnanimity 
Bonaparte subseq
uently repaid by
 death.  The s
tory was very pr
etty and interes
"ting, especially"
 at the point w
here the rivals 
suddenly recogni
zed one another;
 and the ladies 
looked agitated
.  “Charming
!” said Anna P
ávlovna with an
 inquiring glanc
e at the little
 princess.  �
�Charming!” wh
ispered the litt
"le princess, sti"
cking the needle
 into her work 
as if to testify
 that the intere
st and fascinati
on of the story 
 prevented her f
rom going on wit
h it.  The vic
omte appreciated
 this silent pra
ise and smiling 
gratefully prep
ared to continue
", but just then "
"Anna Pávlovna, "
who had kept a 
watchful eye on 
the young man wh
o so alarmed her
", noticed that h"
e was talking t

“The means are

I should advise

 Prince Vasíli

 smile of a coqu

ch at one time p
robably came na
"turally to her, "
but was now very
 ill-suited to h
er careworn face
.  Apparently 
she had forgotte

 force of habit 
employed all th
e old feminine a

 as the prince h
ad gone her face
 resumed its fo
"rmer cold, artif"

. She returned t

    CHAPTER V
  “And what 
do you think of 
this latest come
"dy, the coronati"
on at Milan?”
 asked Anna Páv
"lovna, “and of"
 the comedy of t
he people of Ge
noa and Lucca la
ying their petit

"ieur Buonaparte,"
 and Monsieur B
uonaparte sittin
g on a throne an
d granting the p
etitions of the
 nations? Adorab
le! It is enough
 to make one’s
 head whirl! It 
is as if the wh
ole world had go
ne crazy.”  
Prince Andrew lo
oked Anna Pávlo
vna straight in 
the face with a 
 sarcastic smile
.  “‘Dieu 
"me la donne, gar"
e à qui la touc
he!’’ * They
 say he was ver
y fine when he s
"aid that,” he "
"remarked, repeat"
ing the words in
 Italian: “�
�Dio mi l’ha d
ato. Guai a chi 
la tocchi!’’
       * God h
as given it to m
"e, let him who t"
ouches it beware
!  “I hope t
his will prove t
he last drop tha
t will make the 
"glass run
over,"
” Anna Pávlov
na continued. �
�The sovereigns 
will not be able
 to endure this
 man who is a me
nace to everythi
ng.”  “The
 sovereigns? I d
o not speak of R
"ussia,” said t"
"he vicomte, poli"
te but hopeless
: “The soverei
"gns, madame... W"
hat have they do
ne for Louis XV
"II, for the Quee"
"n, or for Madame"
 Elizabeth? Noth
ing!” and he b
ecame more anim
ated. “And bel
"ieve me, they ar"
e reaping the re
ward of their b
etrayal of the B
ourbon cause. Th
e sovereigns! Wh
"y, they are send"
ing ambassadors
 to compliment t
he usurper.” 
 And sighing di
"sdainfully, he a"
gain changed his
 position.  Pr
"ince Hippolyte, "
who had been gaz
ing at the vicom
te for some time
 through his lo
"rgnette, suddenl"
y turned complet
ely round toward
 the little pri
"ncess, and havin"
g asked for a ne
edle began traci
ng the Condé c
oat of arms on t
he table. He exp
lained this to h
er with as much 
gravity as if s
he had asked him
 to do it.  �
�Bâton de gueul
"es, engrêlé de"
 gueules d’azu
r—maison Cond�
"�,”
said he."
  The princess 
"listened, smilin"
g.  “If Buon
aparte remains o
n the throne of 
France a year lo
"nger,” the
vi"
"comte continued,"
 with the air of
" a man who, in a"
 matter with whi
ch he is better
 acquainted than
" anyone else, do"
es not listen to
 others but fol
lows the current
 of his own thou
"ghts, “things "
will have gone t
oo far. By intr
"igues, violence,"
" exile, and exec"
"utions, French s"
ociety—I mean
 good French soc
iety—will have
 been forever de
"stroyed, and
th"
en....”  He 
shrugged his sho
ulders and sprea
d out his hands.
 Pierre wished t
o make a remark
", for the conver"
sation intereste
"d him, but Anna "
"Pávlovna,
who "
had him under ob
"servation, inter"
rupted:  “Th

choly which alw
ays accompanied

d I believe that

e whole nation w
ill certainly th
row itself into

�� she concluded
", trying to be a"
miable to the r
oyalist emigrant
.  “That is 
"doubtful,” sai"
d Prince Andrew.
 “Monsieur le 
Vicomte quite r
ightly supposes 
that matters hav
e already gone t
oo far. I think 
it will be diff
icult to return 
to the old regim
e.”  “From
 what I have hea
"rd,” said Pier"
"re, blushing and"
 breaking into 
the conversation
", “almost all "
the aristocracy 
has already gone
 over to Bonapa
rte’s side.”
  “It is the
 Buonapartists w
"ho say that,” "
replied the vico
mte without loo
king at Pierre. 
“At the presen
t time it is dif
ficult to know t
he real state o
f French public 
opinion.”  �
��Bonaparte has 
"said so,” rema"
rked Prince Andr
ew with a sarcas
tic smile.  I
t was evident th
at he did not li
ke the vicomte a
nd was aiming hi
s remarks at hi
"m, though withou"
t looking at him
.  “‘I sho
wed them the pat
"h to glory, but "
they did not fol
"low
it,’” P"
rince Andrew con
tinued after a s
"hort silence, ag"
ain quoting Nap
oleon’s words.
 “‘I opened 
my antechambers 
and they crowded
 in.’ I do no
t know how far h
e was justified 
in saying so.”
  “Not in th
"e least,” repl"
ied the vicomte.
 “After the mu
rder of the duc
 even the most p
artial ceased to
 regard him as a
 hero. If to som
"e
people,” he"
" went on, turnin"
g to Anna Pávlo
"vna, “he ever "
"was a hero,
aft"
er the murder of
 the duc there w
as one martyr mo
re in heaven and
 one hero less 
on earth.”  
Before Anna Páv
lovna and the ot
hers had time to
 smile their ap
preciation of th
e vicomte’s ep
"igram, Pierre ag"
ain broke into t
he conversation
", and though Ann"
a Pávlovna felt
 sure he would s
ay something in
"appropriate, she"
 was unable to s
top him.  “T
he execution of 
the Duc d’Engh
"ien,” declared"
 Monsieur Pierre
",
“was a poli"
"tical necessity,"
 and it seems to
 me that Napoleo
n showed greatn
ess of soul by n
ot fearing to ta
ke on himself th
e whole respons
ibility of that 
deed.”  “D
ieu! Mon Dieu!�
� muttered Anna 
Pávlovna in a t
errified whisper
".

“What, Mo"
nsieur Pierre...
 Do you consider
 that assassinat
ion shows great
ness of soul?”
 said the little
" princess, smili"
ng and drawing h
er work nearer 
to her.  “Oh
! Oh!” exclaim
ed several voice
s.  “Capital
!” said Prince
 Hippolyte in En
"glish, and began"
 slapping his k
nee with the pal
m of his hand. 
 The vicomte me
rely shrugged hi
s shoulders. Pie
rre looked solem
nly at his audi
ence over his sp
ectacles and con
tinued.  “I 
"say so,” he co"
ntinued desperat
"ely, “because "
the Bourbons fle
d from the Revo
lution leaving t
he people to ana
"rchy, and Napole"
on alone unders
tood the Revolut
ion and quelled 
"it, and so for t"
"he general good,"
 he could not s
top short for th
e sake of one ma
n’s life.” 
 “Won’t you
 come over to th
e other table?�
� suggested Anna
 Pávlovna.  
But Pierre conti
nued his speech 
without heeding 
"her.

“No,�"
"� cried he, beco"
ming more and mo
"re eager, “Nap"
oleon is great 
because he rose 
superior to the 
"Revolution, supp"
ressed its abuse
"s,
preserved al"
l that was good 
in it—equality
 of citizenship

ly for that reas
on did he obtain
 power.”  �
"��Yes, if having"
" obtained power,"
 without availin
g himself of it 
to commit murde
r he had restore
d it to the righ
"tful king, I sho"
uld have called
 him a great man
",” remarked th"
e vicomte.  �
�He could not do
 that. The peopl
e only gave him 
power that he mi
ght rid them of
 the Bourbons an
d because they s
aw that he was a
 great man. The
 Revolution was 
a grand thing!�
� continued Mons
"ieur Pierre,
be"
traying by this 
desperate and pr
ovocative propos
ition his extrem
e youth and his
 wish to express
 all that was in
 his mind.  �
�What? Revolutio
n and regicide a
 grand thing?...
" Well, after tha"
t... But won’
t you come to th
is other table?�
�� repeated Anna
 Pávlovna.  �
��Rousseau’s C
"ontrat Social,�"
� said the vicom
te with a tolera
nt smile.  �
�I am not speaki
"ng of regicide, "
I am speaking ab
out ideas.”  
 “Yes: ideas o
"f robbery, murde"
"r, and regicide,"
” again interj
ected an ironic
al voice.  “
Those were extre
"mes, no doubt, b"
ut they are not 
what is most im
portant. What is
 important are t
he rights of man
", emancipation f"
"rom
prejudices,"
 and equality of
" citizenship, an"
d all these idea
s Napoleon has 
retained in full
 force.”  �
�Liberty and equ
"ality,” said t"
he vicomte conte
"mptuously, as if"
 at last decidi
ng seriously to 
prove to this yo
uth how foolish 
"his words
were,"
 “high-soundin
g words which ha
ve long been dis
credited. Who do

y? Even our Savi

erty and equali
ty. Have people

trary. We wanted
" liberty, but Bu"
onaparte has des
troyed it.”  
 Prince Andrew k
ept looking with
 an amused smile
 from Pierre to 
the vicomte and
 from the vicomt
e to their hoste
ss. In the first
 moment of Pier
re’s outburst 
"Anna Pávlovna, "
despite her soci
"al experience, w"
as horror-struc
k. But when she 
saw that Pierre�
��s sacrilegious
 words had not 
exasperated the 
"vicomte, and had"
 convinced herse
lf that it was 
impossible to st
"op him, she rall"
ied her forces a
nd joined the vi
comte in a vigo
rous attack on t
he orator.  �
"�But, my dear Mo"
"nsieur Pierre,�"
"� said she, “h"
ow do you explai
n the fact of a
 great man execu
ting a duc—or 
even an ordinary
 man who—is i

"should like,” "
said the vicomte
", “to ask how "
monsieur explain

 It was a swindl

 “He’s a low

emarked Prince H
ippolyte.  Pie
"rre, not knowing"
" whom to answer,"
 looked at them 
all and smiled. 
His smile was u
nlike the half-s

first time saw c
learly that thi
s young Jacobin 
was not so terri
ble as his words
 suggested. All 
were silent.  
 “How do you e
xpect him to ans
wer you all at o
nce?” said Pri
nce Andrew. “
"Besides, in the "
actions of a sta
tesman one has t
o distinguish b
etween his acts 
as a private per
"son, as a genera"
"l, and as an emp"
eror. So it see
ms to me.”  
"“Yes, yes, of "
course!” Pierr
"e chimed in, ple"
ased at the arri
val of this rei
nforcement.  �
��One must admit
",” continued P"
"rince Andrew, �"
�that Napoleon a
s a man was gre
at on the bridge
" of Arcola, and "
in the hospital 
at Jaffa where h
e gave his hand
 to the plague-s
tricken; but ...
 but there are o
ther acts which
 it is difficult
 to justify.” 
  Prince Andrew
", who had eviden"
tly wished to to
ne down the awkw
ardness of Pier
"re’s remarks, "
rose and made a 
sign to his wife
 that it was tim
e to go.  Sud
denly Prince Hip
polyte started u
p making signs t
o everyone to at
"tend,
and askin"
g them all to be
 seated began: 
 “I was told 
a charming Mosco
w story today an
d must treat you
 to it. Excuse 
"me, Vicomte—I "
must tell it in 
Russian or the p
oint will be lo
st....” And Pr
ince Hippolyte b
egan to tell his
 story in such R
ussian as a Fre
nchman would spe
ak after spendin
g about a year i
n Russia. Every
"one waited, so e"
mphatically and 
eagerly did he d
emand their att
ention to his st
ory.  “There
 is in Moscow a 
"lady, une dame, "
and she is very 
stingy. She must
 have two footm
en behind her ca
"rriage, and very"
 big ones. That 
was her taste. 
And she had a la
"dy’s maid, als"
o big. She said.
...”  Here P
rince Hippolyte 
"paused, evidentl"
y collecting his
 ideas with dif
ficulty.  “S
he said.... Oh y
"es! She said, �"
"�Girl,’ to the"
" maid, ‘put on"
" a
livery, get "
up behind the ca
"rriage, and come"
 with me while I
 make some call
s.’”  Here
 Prince Hippolyt
e spluttered and
 burst out laugh
ing long before 
"his
audience, w"
hich produced an
 effect unfavora
ble to the narra
tor. Several pe
"rsons, among the"
m the elderly la
dy and Anna Páv
"lovna, did howev"
er smile.  �
�She went. Sudde
nly there was a 
great wind. The 
girl lost her ha
t and her long 
hair came down..
..” Here he co
uld contain hims
elf no longer a
"nd went on, betw"
een gasps of lau
ghter: “And th
e whole world k
new....”  An
d so the anecdot
e ended. Though 
it was unintelli
gible why he had
" told
it, or wh"
y it had to be t
"old in Russian, "
still Anna Pávl
ovna and the ot
hers appreciated
 Prince Hippolyt
e’s social tac
t in so agreeabl
y ending Pierre
’s unpleasant 
and unamiable ou
tburst. After th
e anecdote the 
conversation bro
ke up into insig
nificant small t
alk about the la
st and next bal
"ls, about theatr"
"icals, and who w"
"ould meet whom, "
and when and wh
ere.      
CHAPTER VI  Ha
ving thanked Ann
a Pávlovna for 
her charming soi
"ree, the guests "
began to take t
heir leave.  P
ierre was ungain
"ly. Stout, about"
 the average hei
"ght, broad, with"
 huge red hands
; he did not kno
"w, as the saying"
" is, how to ente"
r a drawing roo
m and still less
 how to leave on
"e; that is, how "
to say something
 particularly a
greeable before 
going away. Besi
des this he was 
 absent-minded. 
When he rose to 
"go, he took up i"
nstead of his ow
"n, the
general�"
��s three-corner
"ed hat, and held"
" it, pulling at "
"the plume,
till"
 the general ask
ed him to restor
e it. All his ab
sent-mindedness 
and inability t
o enter a room a
nd converse in i
"t was, however, "
redeemed by his
" kindly, simple,"
 and modest expr
ession. Anna Pá
vlovna turned to
"ward
him and, w"
ith a Christian 
mildness that ex
pressed forgiven
ess of his indi
"scretion, nodded"
 and said: “I 
hope to see you 
"again, but I als"
o hope you will
 change your opi
"nions, my dear M"
onsieur Pierre.�
��  When she s
"aid this, he did"
 not reply and o
"nly bowed, but a"
gain everybody 
"saw his smile, w"
hich said nothin
"g, unless perhap"
"s, “Opinions a"
"re
opinions, bu"
t you see what a
" capital, good-n"
atured fellow I 
am.” And ever
"yone, including "
"Anna Pávlovna, "
felt this.  Pr
ince Andrew had 
gone out into th
"e hall, and, tur"
ning his shoulde
rs to the footm
an who was helpi
ng him on with h
"is cloak, listen"
ed indifferentl
y to his wife’
s chatter with P
rince Hippolyte 
who had also co
me into the hall
. Prince Hippoly
te stood close t
"o the pretty, pr"
egnant princess
", and stared fix"
edly at her thro
ugh his eyeglass
".

“Go in, A"
"nnette, or you w"
"ill catch cold,�"
�� said the litt
"le princess,
ta"
king leave of An
na Pávlovna. �
"�It is settled,�"
�� she added in 
a low voice.  
 Anna Pávlovna 
had already mana
ged to speak to 
Lise about the m
atch she contem
plated between A
natole and the l
ittle princess�
� sister-in-law.
  “I rely on
" you, my dear,�"
� said Anna Páv
"lovna, also in a"
 low tone. “W
rite to her and 
let me know how 
her father looks
 at the matter. 
Au revoir! ”�
��and she left t
he hall.  Prin
ce Hippolyte app
roached the litt
"le princess and,"
 bending his fac
"e
close to her,"
 began to whispe
r something.  
"Two footmen, the"
 princess’ and
" his own, stood "
holding a shawl 
"and
a cloak, wa"
iting for the co
nversation to fi
nish. They liste
ned to the Fren
ch sentences whi
ch to them were 
"meaningless, wit"
h an air of und
erstanding but n
ot wishing to ap
pear to do so. T
he princess as u
sual spoke smil
ingly and listen
ed with a laugh.
  “I am very
 glad I did not 
go to the ambass
"ador’s,” sai"
d Prince Hippol
yte “—so dul
l—. It has bee
n a delightful e
"vening, has it
"
not? Delightful!
”  “They s
ay the ball will
" be very good,�"
� replied the pr
"incess, drawing"
 up her downy li
ttle lip. “All
 the pretty wome
n in society wil
l be there.” 
"

“Not all, f"
or you will not 
be there; not al
"l,” said Princ"
e Hippolyte smi
ling joyfully; a
nd snatching the
 shawl from the 
"footman, whom he"
 even pushed as
"ide, he began wr"
apping it round 
the princess. Ei
ther from awkwa
rdness or intent
ionally (no one 
could have said 
which) after the
 shawl had been
 adjusted he kep
t his arm around
 her for a long 
"time, as
though"
 embracing her. 
  Still smiling
", she gracefully"
" moved away, tur"
ning and glancin
g at her husban
d. Prince Andrew
’s eyes were c
"losed, so weary "
and sleepy did h
e seem.  “A
re you ready?”
 he asked his wi
"fe, looking past"
 her.  Prince 
Hippolyte hurrie
dly put on his c
"loak, which in t"
he latest fashio
n reached to hi
"s very heels, an"
"d, stumbling in "
"it, ran out into"
 the porch foll
owing the prince
"ss, whom a footm"
an was helping i
nto the carriage
.  “Princess
"e, au revoir,”"
" cried he, stumb"
ling with his to
ngue as well as
 with his feet. 
"

The princess,"
 picking up her 
"dress, was takin"
g her seat in th
e dark carriage
", her husband wa"
s adjusting his 
saber; Prince Hi
"ppolyte, under
"
pretense of help
"ing, was in ever"
yone’s way.  
"
“Allow me, si"
"r,” said Princ"
e Andrew in Russ
"ian in a cold,
"
disagreeable ton
e to Prince Hipp
olyte who was bl
ocking his path.
  “I am expe
"cting you, Pierr"
"e,” said the s"
"ame voice, but g"
ently and affec
tionately.  Th
e postilion star
"ted, the carriag"
e wheels rattled
. Prince Hippoly
te laughed spas
modically as he 
stood in the por
ch waiting for t
he vicomte whom
 he had promised
 to take home. 
"
“Well, mon c"
"her,” said the"
" vicomte, having"
 seated himself 
beside Hippolyt
e in the carriag
"e, “your littl"
e princess is ve
"ry nice, very
n"
"ice indeed, quit"
"e French,” and"
 he kissed the t
ips of his finge
rs. Hippolyte b
urst out laughin
g.  “Do you 
"know, you are a "
terrible chap fo
r all your innoc
"ent airs,”
co"
ntinued the vico
mte. “I pity t
"he poor husband,"
 that little off
icer who gives 
himself the airs
 of a monarch.�
�  Hippolyte s
"pluttered again,"
 and amid his la
"ughter said, “"
And you were sa
ying that the Ru
ssian ladies are
 not equal to th
e French? One ha
s to know how t
o deal with them
.”  Pierre r
eaching the hous
e first went int
o Prince Andrew�
��s study like 
one quite at hom
"e, and from habi"
t immediately la
y down on the so
"fa, took
from t"
he shelf the fir
st book that cam
e to his hand (i
t was Caesar’s
"
Commentaries),"
 and resting on 
"his elbow, began"
 reading it in t
he middle.  �
�What have you d
one to Mlle Sch�
�rer? She will b
"e quite ill now,"
” said Prince
" Andrew, as he e"
ntered the study
", rubbing his sm"
all white hands
.  Pierre turn
ed his whole bod
"y, making the so"
fa creak. He lif
ted his eager f
ace to Prince An
"drew, smiled, an"
d waved his hand
.  “That abb
é is very inter
esting but he do
es not see the t
hing in the rig
ht light.... In 
my opinion perpe
tual peace is po
ssible but—I d
o not know how 
to express it ..
. not by a balan
ce of political 
power....”  
It was evident t
hat Prince Andre
w was not intere
sted in such abs
tract conversat
ion.  “One c
an’t everywher
e say all one th
"inks, mon cher. "
"Well, have
you "
at last decided 
on anything? Are
 you going to be
 a guardsman or 
a diplomatist?�
�� asked Prince 
Andrew after a m
omentary silence
.  Pierre sat 
"up on the sofa, "
with his legs tu
cked under him. 
"

“Really, I "
don’t yet know
. I don’t like
 either the one 
or the other.�
�  “But you 
must decide on s
omething! Your f
ather expects it
.”  Pierre a
t the age of ten
 had been sent a
broad with an ab
"bé as tutor,
a"
nd had remained 
away till he was
 twenty. When he
 returned to Mos
cow his father 
dismissed the ab
bé and said to 
"the young man, �"
��Now go to Pet
"ersburg, look ro"
"und, and choose "
your profession.
 I will agree to
 anything. Here
 is a letter to 
"Prince Vasíli, "
and here is mone
y. Write to me 
"all about it, an"
d I will help yo
u in everything.
” Pierre had 
already been cho
osing a career f
"or three months,"
 and had not dec
ided on anythin
g. It was about 
this choice that
 Prince Andrew w
as speaking. Pi
erre rubbed his 
forehead.  “
But he must be a
" Freemason,” s"
"aid he, referrin"
g to the abbé w
hom he had met 
that evening.  
 “That is all 
nonsense.” Pri
nce Andrew again
 interrupted him
", “let
us tal"
k business. Have
 you been to the
 Horse Guards?�
"�

“No, I ha"
ve not; but this
 is what I have 
been thinking an
d wanted to tel
l you. There is 
a war now agains
t Napoleon. If i
t were a war for
 freedom I coul
d understand it 
and should be th
e first to enter
 the army; but 
to help England 
and Austria agai
nst the greatest
 man in the worl
d is not right.
”  Prince An
drew only shrugg
ed his shoulders
 at Pierre’s c
hildish words. 
He put on the ai
r of one who fin
ds it impossible
 to reply to suc
"h
nonsense, but"
 it would in fac
t have been diff
icult to give an
y other answer 
than the one Pri
nce Andrew gave 
to this naïve q
uestion.  “I
f no one fought 
except on his ow
"n conviction, th"
ere would be no 
"
wars,” he sai"
d.  “And tha
t would be splen
"did,” said Pie"
rre.  Prince A
ndrew smiled iro
nically.  “V
ery likely it wo
"uld be splendid,"
 but it will nev
er come about...
".”

“Well,"
 why are you goi
ng to the war?�
� asked Pierre. 
  “What for? 
I don’t know. 
I must. Besides 
that I am going.
...” He pause
d. “I am going
 because the lif
e I am leading h
ere does not sui
t me!”    
   CHAPTER VII
  The rustle o
f a woman’s dr
ess was heard in
 the next room. 
Prince Andrew s
hook himself as 
"if waking up, an"
d his face assum
ed the look it 
had had in Anna 
Pávlovna’s dr
awing room. Pier
re removed his f
eet from the so
fa. The princess
 came in. She ha
d changed her go
wn for a house 
dress as fresh a
nd elegant as th
e other. Prince 
Andrew rose and 
politely placed
 a chair for her
.  “How is i
"t,” she began,"
 as usual in Fre
"nch, settling do"
wn briskly and 
fussily in the e
"asy chair, “ho"
w is it Annette 
never got marrie
d? How stupid y
ou men all are n
ot to have marri
ed her! Excuse m
e for saying so
", but you have n"
o sense about wo
men. What an arg
umentative fello
"w you
are, Mons"
ieur Pierre!” 
  “And I am s
till arguing wit
h your husband. 
I can’t unders
tand why he wan
ts to go to the 
"war,” replied "
"Pierre, addressi"
ng the princess 
 with none of th
e embarrassment 
so commonly show
n by young men i
n their interco
urse with young 
women.  The pr
incess started. 
Evidently Pierre
’s words touch
ed her to the q
"uick.

“Ah, "
that is just wha
t I tell him!”
 said she. “I 
don’t underst
and it; I don’
t in the least u
nderstand why me
n can’t live 
without wars. Ho
w is it that we 
women don’t wa
nt anything of t
"he kind,
don’"
t need it? Now y
ou shall judge b
etween us. I alw
ays tell him: He
re he is Uncle�
��s aide-de-camp
", a most brillia"
nt position. He 
is so well know
"n, so much appre"
ciated by everyo
ne. The other da
y at the Aprák
sins’ I heard 
"a lady asking, �"
��Is that the fa
mous Prince And
rew?’ I did in
deed.” She lau
ghed. “He is s
o well received 
 everywhere. He 
might easily bec
ome aide-de-camp
 to the Emperor.
 You know the E
mperor spoke to 
him most graciou
sly. Annette and
 I were speaking
 of how to arra
nge it. What do 
you think?”  
 Pierre looked a
t his friend and
", noticing that "
he did not like 
the conversatio
"n, gave no reply"
.  “When are
 you starting?�
� he asked.  �
"��Oh, don’t sp"
eak of his going
", don’t! I won"
’t hear it spo
"ken
of,” said"
 the princess in
 the same petula
ntly playful ton
e in which she 
had spoken to Hi
ppolyte in the d
rawing room and 
which was so pla
inly ill-suited
 to the family c
ircle of which P
ierre was almost
 a member. “T
oday when I reme
mbered that all 
these delightful
 associations m
ust be broken of
f ... and then y
"ou know, André."
..” (she looke
d significantly
 at her husband)
 “I’m afraid
", I’m afraid!�"
�� she whispere
"d, and a shudder"
 ran down her ba
ck.  Her husba
nd looked at her
 as if surprised
 to notice that 
someone besides 
 Pierre and hims
elf was in the r
"oom, and address"
ed her in a tone
 of frigid poli
teness.  “Wh
at is it you are
" afraid of, Lise"
? I don’t unde
"rstand,” said "
"he.

“There,"
 what egotists m
"en all are: all,"
 all egotists! J
ust for a whim 
"of his own, good"
ness only knows 
"why, he leaves m"
e and locks me u
p alone in the 
country.”  �
��With my father
" and sister, rem"
"ember,” said P"
rince Andrew gen
tly.  “Alone
" all the same, w"
ithout my friend
s.... And he exp
ects me not to 
be afraid.”  
 Her tone was no
w querulous and 
her lip drawn up
", giving her not"
" a
joyful, but "
"an animal, squir"
rel-like express
ion. She paused 
as if she felt 
it indecorous to
 speak of her pr
egnancy before P
"ierre, though th"
e gist of the m
atter lay in tha
t.  “I still
 can’t underst
and what you are
" afraid of,” s"
aid Prince Andr
"ew slowly, not t"
aking his eyes o
ff his wife.  
The princess blu
"shed, and raised"
 her arms with a
 gesture of desp
"air.

“No, A"
"ndrew, I must sa"
y you have chang
"ed. Oh, how you "
have....”  �
��Your doctor te
lls you to go to
" bed earlier,”"
 said Prince And
rew. “You had
 better go.” 
 The princess s
"aid nothing, but"
 suddenly her sh
ort downy lip qu
ivered. Prince 
"Andrew rose, shr"
ugged his should
"ers, and walked "
about the room. 
  Pierre looked
 over his specta
cles with naïve
" surprise, now a"
t him and now a
"t her, moved as "
if about to rise
" too, but change"
d his mind.  �
��Why should I m
ind Monsieur Pie
rre being here?�
�� exclaimed the
 little princes
"s suddenly, her "
pretty face all 
at once distorte
d by a tearful 
grimace. “I ha
ve long wanted t
"o ask you, Andre"
"w, why you have "
changed so to m
e? What have I d
one to you? You 
are going to the
 war and have no
 pity for me. W
hy is it?”  
“Lise!” was 
all Prince Andre
w said. But that
 one word expres
sed an entreaty
", a threat, and "
above all convic
tion that she wo
uld herself reg
ret her words. B
ut she went on h
urriedly:  “
You treat me lik
e an invalid or 
a child. I see i
t all! Did you b
ehave like that
 six months ago?
"”

“Lise, "
I beg you to des
"ist,” said Pri"
nce Andrew still
 more emphatica
"lly.

Pierre, "
who had been gro
wing more and mo
re agitated as h
e listened to a
"ll this, rose an"
d approached the
 princess. He se
emed unable to b
ear the sight o
f tears and was 
ready to cry him
self.  “Calm
" yourself, Princ"
ess! It seems so
 to you because.
... I assure you
 I myself have 
experienced ... 
and so ... becau
"se ... No, excus"
e me! An outsid
er is out of pla
"ce here.... No, "
don’t distress
 yourself.... G
ood-by!”  Pr
ince Andrew caug
ht him by the ha
"nd.

“No, wa"
"it, Pierre! The "
princess is too 
kind to wish to 
deprive me of t
he pleasure of s
pending the even
ing with you.”
"

“No, he th"
inks only of him
"self,” muttere"
d the princess w
ithout restrain
ing her angry te
ars.  “Lise!
” said Prince 
"Andrew dryly, ra"
ising his voice 
to the pitch wh
ich indicates th
at patience is e
xhausted.  Sud
"denly the angry,"
 squirrel-like e
xpression of the
 princess’ pre
tty face change
d into a winning
 and piteous loo
k of fear. Her b
eautiful eyes g
lanced askance a
t her husband’
"s face, and her "
own assumed the 
"timid,
deprecat"
ing expression o
f a dog when it 
rapidly but feeb
ly wags its dro
oping tail.  �
"��Mon Dieu, mon "
Dieu!” she mut
"tered, and lifti"
ng her dress wit
h one hand she 
went up to her h
usband and kisse
d him on the for
ehead.  “Goo
"d night, Lise,�"
"� said he, risin"
g and courteousl
y kissing her ha
nd as he would 
have done to a s
tranger.    
  CHAPTER VIII
  The friends 
were silent. Nei
ther cared to be
gin talking. Pie
rre continually
 glanced at Prin
ce Andrew; Princ
e Andrew rubbed 
his forehead wi
th his small han
d.  “Let us 
go and have supp
"er,” he said w"
"ith a sigh, goin"
g to the door. 
 They entered t
"he elegant, newl"
"y decorated, and"
 luxurious dinin
g room. Everyth
ing from the tab
le napkins to th
"e silver, china,"
 and glass bore 
 that imprint of
 newness found i
n the households
 of the newly ma
rried. Halfway 
through supper P
rince Andrew lea
ned his elbows o
"n the table and,"
 with a look of
 nervous agitati
on such as Pierr
e had never befo
re seen on his 
"face, began to t"
alk—as one who
 has long had so
mething on his m
ind and suddenl
y determines to 
speak out.  �
"�Never, never ma"
"rry, my dear fel"
low! That’s my
 advice: never m
arry till you c
an say to yourse
lf that you have
 done all you ar
"e capable of,
a"
nd until you hav
e ceased to love
 the woman of yo
ur choice and ha
ve seen her pla
"inly as she is, "
or else you will
 make a cruel an
d irrevocable m
istake. Marry wh
en you are old a
nd good for noth
ing—or all tha
t is good and n
oble in you will
 be lost. It wil
l all be wasted 
on trifles. Yes
! Yes! Yes! Don�
��t look at me w
ith such surpris
e. If you marry 
 expecting anyth
ing from yoursel
"f in the future,"
 you will feel a
t every step th
at for you all i
"s ended, all is "
closed except th
"e drawing
room,"
 where you will 
be ranged side b
y side with a co
urt lackey and a
n idiot!... But
 what’s the go
od?...” and he
 waved his arm. 
  Pierre took o
ff his spectacle
"s, which made hi"
s face seem diff
erent and the g
ood-natured expr
ession still mor
"e apparent, and "
gazed at his fri
end in amazemen
t.  “My wife
",” continued P"
"rince Andrew, �"
�is an excellent
" woman, one
of "
those rare women
 with whom a man
’s honor is sa
"fe; but, O God, "
what would I no
t give now to be
 unmarried! You 
are the first an
d only one to w
hom I mention th
"is, because I li"
ke you.”  As
 he said this Pr
ince Andrew was 
less than ever l
ike that Bolkón
ski who had lol
led in Anna Páv
lovna’s easy c
hairs and with h
alf-closed eyes
 had uttered Fre
nch phrases betw
een his teeth. E
very muscle of h
is thin face wa
s now quivering 
with nervous exc
itement; his eye
"s, in which
the"
 fire of life ha
d seemed extingu
"ished, now flash"
ed with brillian
t light. It was
 evident that th
e more lifeless 
he seemed at ord
"inary
times, th"
e more impassion
ed he became in 
these moments of
 almost morbid 
irritation.  �
��You don’t un
derstand why I s
"ay this,” he c"
"ontinued, “but"
 it is the whol
e story of life.
 You talk of Bon
aparte and his c
"areer,” said
"
he (though Pierr
e had not mentio
"ned Bonaparte), "
“but Bonaparte
 when he worked
 went step by st
ep toward his go
"al. He was free,"
 he had nothing 
 but his aim to 
"consider, and he"
 reached it. But
 tie yourself up
 with a woman a
"nd, like a chain"
"ed convict, you "
lose all freedom
! And all you h
ave of hope and 
strength merely 
weighs you down 
and torments you
 with regret. D
"rawing rooms, go"
"ssip, balls, van"

 the enchanted c
ircle I cannot e

� continued Prin

Andrew, “a"

that stupid set

oncluded Prince 
Andrew.  “It
 seems funny to

"re, “that you,"
 you should con

 everything befo

��  He did not
 finish his sent
"ence, but his to"
ne showed how hi
ghly he thought
 of his friend a
nd how much he e
xpected of him i
n the future.  
 “How can he t
alk like that?�
� thought Pierre
. He considered 
his friend a mo
del of perfectio
n because Prince
 Andrew possesse
d in the highes
t degree just th
e very qualities
" Pierre lacked, "
and which might 
 be best describ
ed as strength o
f will. Pierre w
as always astoni
shed at Prince 
Andrew’s calm 
manner of treati
"ng everybody, hi"
s extraordinary 
"
memory, his ext"
ensive reading (
he had read ever
"ything, knew eve"
"rything,
and ha"
d an opinion abo
"ut everything), "
but above all at
 his capacity fo
r work and stud
y. And if Pierre
 was often struc
k by Andrew’s 
lack of capacit
y for philosophi
cal meditation (
to which he hims
elf was particu
"larly addicted),"
 he regarded eve
n this not as a 
defect but as a 
 sign of strengt
h.  Even in th
"e best, most fri"
endly and simple
st relations of 
"life, praise
an"
d commendation a
"re essential, ju"
st as grease is 
necessary to whe
els that they m
ay run smoothly.
  “My part i
"s played out,”"
 said Prince And
rew. “What’s
 the use of tal
king about me? L
et us talk about
" you,” he adde"
d after a silenc
"e,
smiling at h"
is reassuring th
oughts.  That 
smile was immedi
ately reflected 
on Pierre’s fa
ce.  “But wh
at is there to s
ay about me?” 
"said Pierre, his"
 face relaxing 
"into a careless,"
 merry smile. �
�What am I? An i
llegitimate son!
” He suddenly
 blushed crimson
", and it was pla"
in that he had m
ade a great eff
ort to say this.
 “Without a na
me and without m
eans... And it 
really...” But
 he did not say 
what “it reall
y” was. “For
 the present I 
am free and am a
ll right. Only I
 haven’t the l
east idea what 
I am to do; I wa
nted to consult

�  Prince Andr
ew looked kindly
" at him, yet his"

�I am fond of yo

"Yes, you’re al"

re: give up visi

l this debaucher
"y, dissipation, "
and the rest of

?” answered Pi
"erre, shrugging"
 his shoulders. 
"“Women, my dea"
r fellow; women!
”  “I don�
��t understand i
"t,” replied Pr"
ince Andrew. “
Women who are c
"omme il faut, th"
at’s a differe

��women and wine

Pierre was stayi

s and sharing th
e dissipated li
fe of his son An
"atole, the son w"
hom they were pl
anning to refor
m by marrying hi
m to Prince Andr
ew’s sister. 
 “Do you know
?” said Pierre
", as if suddenly"
 struck by a hap
"py
thought, “"
"seriously, I hav"
e long been thin
king of it.... L
eading such a l
ife I can’t de
cide or think pr
operly about any
thing. One’s h
"ead
aches, and "
one spends all o
ne’s money. He
 asked me for to
"night, but I
wo"
n’t go.”  
“You give me y
our word of hono
r not to go?” 
  “On my hono
r!”      
 CHAPTER IX  I
t was past one o
’clock when Pi
erre left his fr
iend. It was a 
"cloudless, north"
"ern, summer nigh"
t. Pierre took a
n open cab inten
ding to drive s
traight home. Bu
t the nearer he 
drew to the hous
e the more he f
elt the impossib
ility of going t
o sleep on such 
a night. It was 
light enough to
 see a long way 
in the deserted 
street and it se
emed more like 
morning or eveni
ng than night. O
n the way Pierre
 remembered that
 Anatole Kurág
in was expecting
 the usual set f
or cards that ev
"ening, after whi"
ch there was ge
nerally a drinki
"ng bout, finishi"
ng with visits o
f a kind Pierre
 was very fond o
f.  “I shoul
d like to go to 
"Kurágin’s,”"
 thought he.  
But he immediate
ly recalled his 
promise to Princ
e Andrew not to 
"go
there. Then,"
 as happens to p
eople of weak ch
"aracter, he desi"
red so passiona
tely once more t
o enjoy that dis
sipation he was 
so accustomed to
 that he decide
d to go. The tho
ught immediately
 occurred to him
 that his promi
se to Prince And
rew was of no ac
"count, because b"
efore he gave it
 he had already
 promised Prince
 Anatole to come
 to his gatherin
"g;
“besides,�"
"�� thought he, �"
��all such ‘wo
rds of honor’ 
are conventiona
l things with no
 definite meanin
"g, especially if"
 one considers 
that by tomorrow
 one may be dead
", or something s"
o extraordinary
 may happen to o
ne that honor an
d dishonor will 
be all the same
!” Pierre ofte
n indulged in re
flections of thi
"s sort, nullifyi"
ng all his deci
sions and intent
ions. He went to
 Kurágin’s. 
 Reaching the l
arge house near 
the Horse Guards
"’ barracks, in"
 which Anatole 
"lived, Pierre en"
tered the lighte
"d porch, ascende"
"d the stairs,
a"
nd went in at th
e open door. The
re was no one in
 the anteroom; e
"mpty
bottles, c"
"loaks, and overs"
hoes were lying 
about; there was
 a smell of alc
"ohol, and sounds"
 of voices and s
houting in the d
istance.  Card
s and supper wer
"e over, but the "
visitors had not
 yet dispersed. 
 Pierre threw of
f his cloak and 
entered the firs
"t room, in which"
 were the remai
ns of supper. A 
"footman, thinkin"
g no one saw him
", was drinking o"
n the sly what 
was left in the 
glasses. From th
e third room cam
e sounds of lau
"ghter, the shout"
ing of familiar 
"voices, the grow"
"ling of a bear, "
and general com
motion. Some eig
ht or nine young
 men were crowdi
ng anxiously ro
und an open wind
ow. Three others
 were romping wi
"th a young bear,"
 one pulling hi
m by the chain a
nd trying to set
 him at the othe
rs.  “I bet 
a hundred on Ste
vens!” shouted
 one.  “Mind
", no holding on!"
” cried anothe
r.  “I bet o
n Dólokhov!” 
cried a third. �
"��Kurágin, you "
part our hands.
"”

“There,"
 leave Bruin alo
ne; here’s a b
et on.”  “
"At one draught, "
or he loses!” 
shouted a fourth
".

“Jacob, b"
ring a bottle!�
� shouted the ho
"st, a tall, hand"
some fellow who
 stood in the mi
dst of the group
", without a coat"
", and with his f"
ine linen shirt
 unfastened in f
ront. “Wait a 
"bit, you fellows"
.... Here is P�
�tya! Good man!�
"�� cried he, add"
ressing Pierre. 
  Another voice
", from a man of "
medium height wi
th clear blue ey
"es,
particularl"
y striking among
 all these drunk
en voices by its
" sober
ring, cr"
ied from the win
dow: “Come her
e; part the bets
!” This was D
"ólokhov, an off"
icer of the Sem�
"�nov regiment, a"
 notorious gambl
"er and
duelist,"
 who was living 
with Anatole. Pi
"erre smiled, loo"
king about him 
merrily.  “I
 don’t underst
and. What’s it
 all about?” 
"
“Wait a bit,"
 he is not drunk
 yet! A bottle h
"ere,” said Ana"
"tole, and
takin"
g a glass from t
he table he went
 up to Pierre. 
 “First of al
l you must drink
!”  Pierre d
rank one glass a
"fter another, lo"
oking from under
 his brows at t
he tipsy guests 
who were again c
rowding round th
"e window, and li"
stening to thei
r chatter. Anato
le kept on refil
ling Pierre’s 
glass while exp
laining that Dó
lokhov was betti
"ng with Stevens,"
 an English nava
"l
officer, that"
 he would drink 
a bottle of rum 
sitting on the o
uter ledge of t
he third floor w
indow with his l
egs hanging out.
"

“Go on, yo"
u must drink it 
"all,” said Ana"
"tole, giving Pie"
rre the last gl
"ass, “or I won"
’t let you go!
"”

“No, I "
"won’t,” said"
" Pierre, pushing"
" Anatole aside, "
and he went up 
to the window. 
 Dólokhov was 
holding the Engl
ishman’s hand 
and clearly and 
distinctly repe
ating the terms 
"of the bet, addr"
essing himself p
articularly to 
Anatole and Pier
re.  Dólokhov
 was of medium h
"eight, with curl"
y hair and light
-blue eyes. He 
was about twenty
-five. Like all 
infantry officer
s he wore no mus
"tache,
so that "
"his mouth, the m"
ost striking fea
ture of his face
", was clearly
s"
een. The lines o
f that mouth wer
e remarkably fin
ely curved. The 
middle of the u
pper lip formed 
a sharp wedge an
d closed firmly 
on the firm low
"er one, and some"
thing like two d
istinct smiles p
layed continuall
y round the two
 corners of the 
"mouth; this, tog"
ether with the r
"esolute,
insole"
nt intelligence 
"of his eyes, pro"
duced an effect 
which made it i
mpossible not to
 notice his face
. Dólokhov was 
a man of small m
eans and no con
"nections. Yet, t"
hough Anatole sp
ent tens of thou
sands of rubles
", Dólokhov live"
d with him and h
ad placed himsel
f on such a foo
ting that all wh
"o knew them, inc"
luding Anatole h
"imself, respecte"
d him more than
 they did Anatol
e. Dólokhov cou
ld play all game
s and nearly al
ways won. Howeve
"r much he drank,"
 he never lost h
is clearheadedne
ss. Both Kurág
in and Dólokhov
 were at that ti
me notorious amo
ng the rakes an
d scapegraces of
 Petersburg.  
The bottle of ru
m was brought. T
he window frame 
which prevented 
anyone from sit
ting on the oute
r sill was being
 forced out by t
"wo footmen, who"
 were evidently 
flurried and int
imidated by the 
directions and s
houts of the ge
ntlemen around. 
  Anatole with 
his swaggering a
ir strode up to 
the window. He w
anted to smash 
something. Pushi
ng away the foot
men he tugged at
" the frame, but"
 could not move 
it. He smashed a
 pane.  “You
" have a try, Her"
"cules,” said h"
"e, turning to Pi"
erre.  Pierre 
seized the cross
"beam, tugged, an"
d wrenched the o
ak frame out wit
h a crash.  �
��Take it right 
"out, or they’l"
l think I’m ho
"lding on,” sai"
d Dólokhov.  
 “Is the Engli
shman bragging?.
.. Eh? Is it all
 right?” said 
Anatole.  “F
"irst-rate,” sa"
"id Pierre, looki"
"ng at Dólokhov,"
 who with a bott
le of rum in hi
s hand was appro
aching the windo
"w, from which th"
e light of the 
"sky, the dawn me"
rging with the a
fterglow of suns
"et, was visible."
"

Dólokhov, t"
he bottle of rum
 still in his ha
"nd, jumped onto "
the window sill
. “Listen!” 
"cried he, standi"
ng there and add
ressing those in
 the room. All 
were silent.  
“I bet fifty i
mperials”—he
 spoke French th
at the Englishma
n might underst
"and him, but he "
did not speak it
 very well—“
I bet fifty imp
erials ... or do
 you wish to mak
e it a hundred?�
"�� added he,
ad"
dressing the Eng
lishman.  “N
"o, fifty,” rep"
lied the latter.
  “All right
. Fifty imperial
s ... that I wil
l drink a whole 
bottle of rum w
ithout taking it
" from my mouth, "
sitting outside 
the window on th
is spot” (he 
stooped and poin
ted to the slopi
ng ledge outside
 the window) �
�and without hol
ding on to anyth
ing. Is that rig
ht?”  “Qui
"te right,” sai"
d the Englishman
.  Anatole tur
ned to the Engli
shman and taking
 him by one of t
he buttons of h
is coat and look
ing down at him�
��the Englishman
 was short—beg
an repeating th
e terms of the w
ager to him in E
nglish.  “Wa
it!” cried Dó
"lokhov, hammerin"
g with the bottl
e on the window 
 sill to attract
 attention. “W
"ait a bit, Kurá"
gin. Listen! If 
 anyone else doe
"s the same, I wi"
ll pay him a hun
dred imperials. 
Do you understa
nd?”  The En
"glishman nodded,"
 but gave no ind
ication whether 
he intended to 
accept this chal
lenge or not. An
atole did not re
"lease him, and t"
hough he kept n
odding to show t
hat he understoo
"d, Anatole went "
on translating 
Dólokhov’s wo
rds into English
. A thin young l
"ad, an hussar of"
 the Life Guard
"s, who had been "
losing that even
"ing, climbed on "
the window sill
", leaned over, a"
nd looked down. 
  “Oh! Oh! Oh
!” he muttered
", looking down f"
rom the window a
t the stones of
 the pavement. 
 “Shut up!”
 cried Dólokhov
", pushing him aw"
ay from the wind
ow. The lad jum
ped awkwardly ba
ck into the room
", tripping over "
his spurs.  Pl
acing the bottle
 on the window s
ill where he cou
ld reach it easi
"ly,
Dólokhov c"
limbed carefully
 and slowly thro
ugh the window a
nd lowered his 
legs. Pressing a
gainst both side
"s of the window,"
 he adjusted him
self on his sea
"t, lowered his h"
"ands, moved a li"
ttle to the righ
t and then to t
"he left, and too"
k up the bottle.
 Anatole brought
 two candles and
 placed them on
 the window sill
", though it was "
already quite li
ght. Dólokhov�
��s back in his 
"white shirt, and"
" his curly head,"
 were lit up fr
om both sides. E
veryone crowded 
"to the window, t"
he Englishman in
 front. Pierre 
stood smiling bu
t silent. One ma
"n, older than th"
e others presen
"t, suddenly push"
ed forward with 
a scared and ang
ry look and want
ed to seize hol
d of Dólokhov�
�s shirt.  “
"I say, this is f"
olly! He’ll be
" killed,” said"
 this more sensi
ble man.  Ana
tole stopped him
.  “Don’t 
touch him! You�
�ll startle him 
and then he’ll
 be killed. Eh?
... What then?..
. Eh?”  Dól
okhov turned rou
"nd and, again ho"
lding on with bo
"th hands, arrang"
ed himself on h
is seat.  “I
f anyone comes m
"eddling again,�"
"� said he, emitt"
ing the words s
eparately throug
h his thin compr
"essed lips, “I"
 will throw him 
down there. Now
 then!”  Say
ing this he agai
"n turned round, "
dropped his hand
"s, took the bott"
le and lifted i
"t to his lips, t"
hrew back his he
"ad, and raised h"
is free hand to
 balance himself
. One of the foo
tmen who had sto
oped to pick up 
some broken gla
ss remained in t
hat position wit
hout taking his 
eyes from the w
indow and from D
ólokhov’s bac
k. Anatole stood
 erect with star
ing eyes. The E
nglishman looked
" on sideways, pu"
rsing up his lip
s. The man who 
had wished to st
op the affair ra
n to a corner of
 the room and th
rew himself on 
a sofa with his 
face to the wall
. Pierre hid his
" face, from
whi"
ch a faint smile
 forgot to fade 
though his featu
res now expresse
d horror and fe
ar. All were sti
ll. Pierre took 
his hands from h
is eyes. Dólok
hov still sat in
 the same positi
"on, only his hea"
d was thrown fu
rther back till 
his curly hair t
ouched his shirt
" collar, and the"
 hand holding t
he bottle was li
fted higher and 
higher and tremb
led with the ef
fort. The bottle
 was emptying pe
rceptibly and ri
sing still highe
r and his head 
tilting yet furt
her back. “Why
 is it so long?�
�� thought Pier
re. It seemed to
 him that more t
han half an hour
 had elapsed. S
uddenly Dólokho
v made a backwar
d movement with 
"his spine, and h"
is arm trembled
 nervously; this
 was sufficient 
to cause his who
le body to slip 
 as he sat on th
e sloping ledge.
 As he began sli
"pping down, his "
head and arm wa
vered still more
 with the strain
. One hand moved
 as if to clutch
 the window sil
"l, but refrained"
 from touching i
t. Pierre again 
covered his eye
s and thought he
 would never ope
n them again. Su
ddenly he was a
ware of a stir a
ll around. He lo
oked up: Dólokh
ov was standing 
on the window s
"ill, with a pale"
 but radiant fac
e.  “It’s 
empty.”  He 
threw the bottle
 to the Englishm
"an, who caught i"
t neatly. Dólok
hov jumped down
. He smelt stron
gly of rum.  �
��Well done!... 
Fine fellow!... 
There’s a bet 
for you!... Devi
l take you!” 
came from differ
ent sides.  Th
e Englishman too
k out his purse 
and began counti
ng out the money
. Dólokhov sto
od frowning and 
did not speak. P
ierre jumped upo
n the window si
ll.  “Gentle
"men, who wishes "
to bet with me? 
I’ll do the sa
me thing!” he
 suddenly cried.
 “Even without
" a bet, there! T"
ell them to brin
g me a bottle. 
I’ll do it....
 Bring a bottle!
”  “Let hi
"m do it, let him"
" do it,” said "
"Dólokhov, smili"
ng.  “What n
ext? Have you go
ne mad?... No on
e would let you!
"... Why, you go"
 giddy even on a
" staircase,” e"
xclaimed several
 voices.  “I
’ll drink it! 
Let’s have a b
ottle of rum!”
" shouted Pierre,"
 banging the ta
ble with a deter
mined and drunke
n gesture and pr
eparing to clim
b out of the win
dow.  They sei
zed him by his a
rms; but he was 
so strong that e
veryone who tou
ched him was sen
t flying.  “
"No, you’ll nev"
er manage him th
"at way,” said "
Anatole. “Wait
 a bit and I’
ll get round him
.... Listen! I�
�ll take your be

but"
 now we are all 
going to ——�
��s.”  “Co
"me on then,” c"
ried Pierre. “
Come on!... And 
we’ll take Bru
in with us.” 
  And he caught
" the bear, took "

 visitors to the
 Countess Rostó

 on the Povarsk

herself and her
 handsome eldest
 daughter were i
n the drawing ro

tors who came t
"o congratulate, "
and who constant
ly succeeded one
 another in rel
ays.  The coun
tess was a woman
 of about forty-
"five, with a thi"
n Oriental type 
"
of face, eviden"
tly worn out wit
h childbearing�
�she had had twe

of motion and sp

"from weakness, g"
ave her a disti

ch inspired resp

na Mikháylovna 
"
Drubetskáya, w"
ho as a member o
f the household 
was also seated 
in the drawing 
"room, helped to "
receive and ente
rtain the visito
rs. The young p
eople were in on
e of the inner r
"ooms, not consid"
ering it necessa
ry to take part
 in receiving th
e visitors. The 
count met the gu
ests and saw th
"em off, inviting"
 them all to din
ner.  “I am 
"very, very grate"
"ful to you, mon "
"cher,” or “m"
a chère”—he
 called everyon
e without except
ion and without 
the slightest va
riation in his 
"tone, “my dear"
",” whether the"
y were above or 
below him in ra
nk—“I thank 
you for myself a
nd for our two d

keeping. But min
d you come to di

"be offended,
ma"

lf of the whole 
family I beg you
" to come, mon ch"

rds he repeated 
to everyone with
out exception or
" variation, and"
 with the same e
xpression on his
" full, cheerful,"
 clean-shaven fa
"ce, the
same fi"
rm pressure of t
he hand and the 
"same quick, repe"
ated bows. As s
oon as he had se
en a visitor off
 he returned to 
one of those who
 were still in 
the drawing room
", drew a chair t"
oward him or her
", and jauntily
"
spreading out hi
s legs and putti
ng his hands on 
his knees with t
he air of a man
 who enjoys life
 and knows how t
"o live, he swaye"
d to and fro wi
"th dignity, offe"
red surmises abo

or touched on q
uestions of heal

 Russian and som
etimes in very b
ad but self-con
fident French; t
"hen again, like "
a man weary but 
unflinching in 
the fulfillment 
"of duty, he rose"
 to see some vis
"itors off and, s"
troking his sca
nty gray hairs o
ver his bald pat
"ch, also asked t"
hem to dinner. 
Sometimes on his
 way back from t
he anteroom he w
ould pass throug
h the conservat
ory and pantry i
nto the large ma
rble dining hall
", where tables
"
were being set o
ut for eighty pe
ople; and lookin

were brin"
ging in silver a

olding damask t
"able linen, he w"
ould call Dmítr
"i Vasílevich, a"
 man of good fam
ily and the man
ager of all his 
"affairs, and whi"
le looking with 
pleasure at the 
 enormous table 
would say: “We
"ll, Dmítri, you"
’ll see that t
hings are all a
s they should be
? That’s right
! The great thin
g is the serving
",
that’s it.�"
�� And with a co
mplacent sigh he
 would return to
 the drawing ro
om.  “Márya
 Lvóvna Karági
na and her daugh
ter!” announce
d the countess�
�� gigantic foot
man in his bass 
"voice, entering "
the drawing roo
m. The countess 
reflected a mome
nt and took a pi
nch from a gold 
 snuffbox with h
er husband’s p
ortrait on it. 
 “I’m quite
 worn out by the
se callers. Howe
"ver, I’ll see "
her and no more
. She is so affe
cted. Ask her in
",” she said to"
 the footman in 
"a
sad voice, as"
 if saying: “V
"ery well, finish"
 me off.”  A
" tall, stout, an"
d proud-looking 
"woman, with a ro"
und-faced smilin
"g
daughter, ent"
ered the drawing
" room, their dre"
sses rustling. 
 “Dear Counte
"ss, what an age."
.. She has been 
"laid up, poor ch"
ild ... at the 
Razumóvski’s 
ball ... and Cou

 ... I was so d
elighted...” c
ame the sounds o
f animated femin

int"
errupting one an
other and mingli
ng with the rust

and the scrapin

n one of those c

an which last o
"ut until, at the"
" first pause, th"
e guests rise wi
th a rustle of d

and say,"
 “I am so deli

 Countess Aprá
ksina...” and 
"then, again rust"
"ling, pass into "
"the anteroom, pu"
t on cloaks or 
"mantles, and dri"
ve away. The con
versation was on
 the chief topi
c of the day: th
e illness of the
 wealthy and cel
ebrated beau of 
 Catherine’s d
"ay, Count Bezúk"
"hov, and about h"
is illegitimate 
"son
Pierre, the"
 one who had beh
aved so improper
ly at Anna Pávl
ovna’s recept
ion.  “I am 
so sorry for the
" poor count,” "
said the visitor
. “He is in s
"uch bad health, "
and now this vex
ation about his 
son is enough to
 kill him!” 
 “What is tha
t?” asked the 
countess as if s
he did not know 
what the visito
"r alluded to, th"
ough she had alr
eady heard about
 the cause of C
ount Bezúkhov�
�s distress some
 fifteen times. 
  “That’s w
hat comes of a m
"odern education,"
” exclaimed th
e visitor. “I
t seems that whi
le he was abroad
 this young man 
was allowed to d
"o
as he liked, "
now in Petersbur
g I hear he has 
been doing such 
terrible things
 that he has bee
n expelled by th
e police.”  
“You don’t s
ay so!” replie
d the countess. 
  “He chose h
is friends badly
",” interposed "
Anna Mikháylovn
a. “Prince Va
"síli’s son, h"
"e, and a certain"
" Dólokhov have,"
" it is said,
be"
en up to heaven 
only knows what!
 And they have h
ad to suffer for
 it. Dólokhov 
has been degrade
d to the ranks a
nd Bezúkhov’s
 son sent back 
to Moscow. Anato
le Kurágin’s 
father managed s
omehow to get hi
s son’s affai
"r hushed up, but"
 even he was ord
ered out of Pete

�But what have t
hey been up to?�
�� asked the cou
ntess.  “The
y are regular br
"igands, especial"

 replied the vi
sitor. “He is 
a son of Márya 
Ivánovna Dólok

"there, just fanc"
y! Those three g
ot hold of a bea

pu"
t it in a carria

with it to visit
 some actresses!
 The police tri
"ed to interfere,"
 and what did th
e young men do? 
They tied a pol
iceman and the b
ear back to back
 and put the bea
r into the Moyka
 Canal. And the
re was the bear 
swimming about w
ith the policema
n on his back!�
��  “What a 
nice figure the 
policeman must h
"ave cut, my dear"
!” shouted th
"e count, dying w"
ith laughter.  
"
“Oh, how drea"
dful! How can yo
"u laugh at it, C"
ount?”  Yet 
the ladies thems
elves could not 
help laughing. 
 “It was all 
they could do to
 rescue the poor
" man,” continu"
ed the visitor.
 “And to think
 it is Cyril Vla
dímirovich Bez�
�khov’s son w
ho amuses himsel
f in this sensib
le manner! And h
e was said to be
 so well educat
ed and clever. T
his is all that 
his foreign educ

for him! I hope 
that here in Mos
cow no one will 
"receive him, in"
 spite of his mo
ney. They wanted
 to introduce hi
"m to me, but I q"
uite declined: 
I have my daught

”  “Why do
 you say this yo
ung man is so ri
ch?” asked the
" countess,
turn"
ing away from th
"e girls, who at "
once assumed an 
air of inattenti
on. “His chil
dren are all ill
egitimate. I thi
nk Pierre also i
s illegitimate.
”  The visit
or made a gestur
e with her hand.
  “I should 
think he has a s
core of them.”
  Princess Ann
a Mikháylovna i
ntervened in the
" conversation, e"
vidently wishin
g to show her co
nnections and kn
owledge of what 
went on in soci
ety.  “The f
act of the matte
"r is,” said sh"
"e significantly,"
 and also in a 
"half whisper, �"
�everyone knows 
Count Cyril’s 
reputation.... H
e has lost coun
t of his childre
"n, but this Pier"

w handsome the o

 only a year ago
!” remarked th
e countess. “
I have never see
n a handsomer ma
n.”  “He i
s very much alte
"red now,” said"
 Anna Mikháylov
"na. “Well, as"
"
I was saying, P"
rince Vasíli is
 the next heir t
"hrough his wife,"
 but the count 
is very fond of 
"Pierre, looked a"
fter his educati
"on, and wrote to"
 the Emperor ab
out him; so that
 in the case of 
his death—and 
he is so ill th
at he may die at
" any moment, and"
 Dr. Lorrain has
 come from Pete
rsburg—no one 
knows who will i
nherit his immen
"se fortune, Pier"
re or Prince Va
síli. Forty tho
usand serfs and 
millions of rubl
es! I know it a
ll very well for
 Prince Vasíli 
told me himself.
" Besides, Cyril"
 Vladímirovich 
is my mother’s
 second cousin. 
He’s also my B
óry’s godfat
"her,” she adde"
"d, as if she att"
ached no importa

e fact.  “P
rince Vasíli ar
rived in Moscow 
yesterday. I hea

 some inspectio

emarked the visi

“Yes, "
but between ours
"elves,” said t"
"he princess, “"
that is a prete

he has come to s
ee Count Cyril V
"ladímirovich,
"
hearing how ill 
he is.”  “
"But do you know,"
" my dear, that w"
as a capital jok
"e,” said the c"
ount; and seein
g that the elder
 visitor was not
" listening, he t"
urned to the yo
ung ladies. “I
 can just imagin
e what a funny f
igure that polic
eman cut!”  
 And as he waved
 his arms to imp
ersonate the pol
"iceman, his port"
ly form again s
hook with a deep
" ringing laugh, "
the laugh of one
 who always eats
"
well and, in p"
"articular, drink"
s well. “So do
 come and dine w
ith us!” he s
aid.      
CHAPTER XI  Si
lence ensued. Th
e countess looke
d at her callers
", smiling affabl"
"y,
but not conc"
ealing the fact 
that she would n
ot be distressed
 if they now ro
se and took thei
r leave. The vis
itor’s daughte
r was already s
moothing down he
r dress with an 
inquiring look a
"t her mother, wh"
en suddenly fro
m the next room 
were heard the f
ootsteps of boys
 and girls runn
ing to the door 
and the noise of
 a chair falling
" over, and a gir"
"l
of thirteen, "
hiding something
 in the folds of
 her short musli
"n frock,
darted"
 in and stopped 
short in the mid
dle of the room.
 It was evident 
 that she had no
t intended her f
light to bring h
er so far. Behin
d her in the do
orway appeared a
 student with a 
crimson coat col
"lar, an officer"
"
of the Guards, "
a girl of fiftee
"n, and a plump r"
osy-faced boy in
 a short jacket
.  The count j
"umped up and, sw"
aying from side 
"to side, spread "
his arms wide a
nd threw them ro
und the little g
irl who had run 
"in.

“Ah, he"
re she is!” he
 exclaimed laugh
"ing. “My pet, "
whose name day 
it is. My dear p
et!”  “Ma 
"chère, there is"
 a time for ever
"ything,” said "
the countess wit
h feigned sever
ity. “You spoi
"l her, Ilyá,”"
" she added, turn"
ing to her husb
and.  “How d
"o you do, my dea"
r? I wish you ma
ny happy returns
 of your name d
"ay,” said the "
visitor. “What
 a charming chil
"d,” she added,"
 addressing the
 mother.  This
" black-eyed, wid"
"e-mouthed girl, "
not pretty but f
ull of life—wi
th childish bar
e shoulders whic
h after her run 
heaved and shook
" her
bodice, wi"
th black curls t
"ossed backward, "
"thin bare arms, "
little legs in 
lace-frilled dra
"wers, and feet i"
n low slippers�
�was just at tha
t charming age 
when a girl is n
o longer a child
", though the chi"
ld is not yet a
 young woman. Es
caping from her 
father she ran t
o hide her flush
ed face in the 
lace of her moth
er’s mantilla�
��not paying the
 least attentio
n to her severe 
remark—and beg
an to laugh. She
" laughed, and in"
 fragmentary se
ntences tried to
 explain about a
 doll which she 
produced from t
he folds of her 
frock.  “Do 
you see?... My d
oll... Mimi... Y
ou see...” was
 all Natásha m
anaged to utter 
(to her everythi
ng seemed funny)
. She leaned aga
inst her mother
 and burst into 
"such a loud, rin"
ging fit of laug
hter that even 
the prim visitor
 could not help 
joining in.  �
"��Now then, go a"
way and take you
r monstrosity wi
"th you,” said "
"the
mother, pus"
hing away her da
ughter with pret
"ended sternness,"
 and turning to
 the visitor she
 added: “She i
s my youngest gi
rl.”  Natás
"ha, raising her "
face for a momen
t from her mothe
"r’s mantilla,"
 glanced up at h
er through tears
" of laughter, an"
d again hid her 
face.  The vis
"itor, compelled "
to look on at th
"is family scene,"
 thought it nec
essary to take s
ome part in it. 
"

“Tell me, m"
"y dear,” said "
"she to Natásha,"
 “is Mimi a re
lation of yours
"? A daughter, I "
suppose?”  N
atásha did not 
like the visitor
’s tone of con
descension to ch
ildish things. 
She did not repl
"y, but looked at"
 her seriously. 
  Meanwhile the
 younger generat
"ion: Borís, the"
" officer, Anna
"
Mikháylovna’s
" son; Nicholas, "
the undergraduat
"e, the count’s"
 eldest son; S�
"�nya, the count�"
��s fifteen-year
"-old niece, and "
"little Pétya,
"
his youngest boy
", had all settle"
d down in the dr
awing room and w
ere obviously t
rying to restrai
n within the bou
nds of decorum t
he excitement a
nd mirth that sh
one in all their
 faces. Evidentl
y in the back ro
"oms,
from which"
 they had dashed
 out so impetuou
"sly, the convers"
ation had been 
more amusing tha
n the drawing ro
om talk of socie
"ty scandals, the"
"
weather, and C"
ountess Apráksi
na. Now and then
 they glanced at
" one
another, h"
ardly able to su
ppress their lau
ghter.  The tw
"o young men, the"
 student and the
" officer, friend"
s from childhood
",
were of the s"
ame age and both
 handsome fellow
"s, though not al"
ike. Borís was
" tall and fair, "
and his calm and
 handsome face h
"ad regular, deli"
cate features. 
Nicholas was sho
rt with curly ha
ir and an open e
xpression. Dark
 hairs were alre
ady showing on h
"is upper lip, an"
d his whole face
 expressed impe
tuosity and enth
usiasm. Nicholas
 blushed when he
 entered the dr
awing room. He e
vidently tried t
o find something
" to say, but
fa"
iled. Borís on 
the contrary at 
once found his f
"ooting, and rela"
ted quietly and
 humorously how 
he had known tha
t doll Mimi when
 she was still 
quite a young la
"dy, before her n"
ose was broken; 
how she had aged
 during the fiv
e years he had k
"nown her, and ho"
w her head had c
racked right ac
ross the skull. 
Having said this
 he glanced at N
atásha. She tu
rned away from h
im and glanced a
t her younger br
"other, who was
"
screwing up his 
eyes and shaking
 with suppressed
" laughter, and u"
nable to contro
l herself any lo
"nger, she jumped"
 up and rushed f
rom the room as 
 fast as her nim
ble little feet 
would carry her.
 Borís did not 
laugh.  “You
 were meaning to
" go out, weren�"
"�t you, Mamma? D"
o you want the 
carriage?” he 
asked his mother
 with a smile. 
"
“Yes, yes, g"
o and tell them 
"to get it ready,"
” she answered
",
returning his"
 smile.  Borí
s quietly left t
he room and went
 in search of Na
tásha. The plum
p boy ran after
" them angrily, a"
s if vexed that 
their program ha
d been disturbe
d.      CH
APTER XII  The
 only young peop
le remaining in 
the drawing room
", not counting t"
he young lady v
isitor and the c
ountess’ eldes
t daughter (who 
was four years 
older than her s
ister and behave
d already like a
 grown-up person
"),
were Nichola"
"s and Sónya, th"
e niece. Sónya 
was a slender li

k in her eyes wh
ich were veiled 
"by long

 thick black pla
its coiling twic
e round her head
", and a tawny
t"
int in her compl
exion and especi
ally in the colo
r of her slender
 but graceful a

 and neck. By th
e grace of her m
"ovements,
by th"
e softness and f
lexibility of he
"r small limbs, a"
nd by a certain 
 coyness and res
"erve of manner, "
she reminded one
" of a pretty, ha"
lf-grown kitten
 which promises 
to become a beau
tiful little cat
. She evidently 
 considered it p
roper to show an
 interest in the
 general convers
ation by smilin
"g, but in spite "
of herself her e
yes under their 
thick long lashe

 they too could

"and Borís, esca"

"Ah yes, my dear,"
” said the cou

count in an inqu

��But they say t

plied the visito
r.  “They’

"o a long while,�"
�� said the coun

��ll say so agai
"n and again, and"
 that will be th

 friendship for

ted. “He’s j

"isitor, not know"
"ing what to say,"
 shook her head.
  “It’s no
t at all from fr
"iendship,” dec"
"lared Nicholas, "
flaring up and 
turning away as 
if from a shamef
ul aspersion. �
�It is not from 
 friendship at a
ll; I simply fee
l that the army 
is my vocation.�
��  He glanced
 at his cousin a
nd the young lad
y visitor; and t
hey were both r
egarding him wit
h a smile of app
robation.  “
"Schubert, the co"
lonel of the Pá

ng Nicholas back

an’t be helped

"unt, shrugging h"
is shoulders and
 speaking playf
ully of a matter
 that evidently 
distressed him. 
  “I have alr

 I’ll stay. Bu

e spoke he kept 
glancing with t
he flirtatiousne
ss of a handsome
 youth at Sónya
 and the young 
lady visitor.  
 The little kitt
"en, feasting her"
" eyes on him, se"
emed ready at an

 her kittenish n

 how he rose fr

 became Emperor.
" Well, well, God"
" grant it,” he"
"
added, not not"
icing his visito

 “What a pity

It was so dull

"said she, giving"
 him a tender sm

Nicholas’ anim

 He waited for t

 CHAPTER XIII 
 When Natásha 
ran out of the d
rawing room she 
only went as far
 as the conserv
atory. There she
 paused and stoo
d listening to t
he conversation 
 in the drawing 
"room, waiting fo"
r Borís to come
 out. She was al
ready growing i
"mpatient, and st"
"amped her foot, "
ready to cry at 
his not coming 
"at once, when sh"
e heard the youn
g man’s discre
et steps approac
hing neither qu
ickly nor slowly
. At this Natás
ha dashed swiftl
y among the flo

 there.  Borí
s paused in the 
middle of the ro

", brushed a litt"
le dust from th
e sleeve of his 
"uniform, and goi"
ng up to a mirro
r examined his 
handsome face. N
"atásha, very st"
"ill, peered out "
"from her ambush,"
 waiting to see
 what he would d
o. He stood a li
ttle while befor
"e the
glass, sm"
"iled, and walked"
 toward the othe
r door. Natásha
 was about to c
all him but chan
ged her mind. �
�Let him look fo
"r me,” thought"
 she. Hardly ha
d Borís gone th
"an Sónya, flush"
"ed, in tears, an"
d muttering ang
"rily, came in at"
 the other door.
 Natásha checke
d her first impu
lse to run out 
"to her, and rema"
ined in her hidi
"ng place, watchi"
ng—as under a
n invisible cap�
��to see what we
nt on in the wor
ld. She was exp
eriencing a new 
and peculiar ple
"asure. Sónya, m"
uttering to hers
"elf,
kept looki"
ng round toward 
the drawing room
 door. It opened
 and Nicholas c
ame in.  “S�
"�nya, what is th"
e matter with yo
u? How can you?�
"�� said he, runn"
ing up to her. 
  “It’s not
"hing, nothing; l"
eave me alone!�
� sobbed Sónya.
"

“Ah, I kno"
w what it is.”
"

“Well, if "
"you do, so much "
"the better, and "
you can go back 
to her!”  �
�Só-o-onya! Loo
k here! How can 
you torture me a
nd yourself like
" that,
for a me"
re fancy?” sai
d Nicholas takin
g her hand.  S
ónya did not pu
"ll it away, and "
left off crying.
" Natásha, not s"
tirring and sca
"rcely breathing,"
 watched from he
r ambush with sp
arkling eyes. �
��What will happ
en now?” thoug
ht she.  “S�
�nya! What is an
yone in the worl
d to me? You alo
ne are everythi
ng!” said Nich
olas. “And I w
ill prove it to 
you.”  “I 
don’t like you
 to talk like th
at.”  “Wel
"l, then, I won�"
�t; only forgive
" me, Sónya!” "
He drew her to h
im and kissed h
"er.

“Oh, ho"
"w nice,” thoug"
ht Natásha; and
 when Sónya and
 Nicholas had g
one out of the c
onservatory she 
followed and cal
led Borís to he
"r.

“Borís,"
" come here,” s"
aid she with a s
ly and significa
nt look. “I h
ave something to
" tell you. Here,"
 here!” and sh
e led him into t
he conservatory
 to the place am
ong the tubs whe
re she had been 
hiding.  Borí
"s followed her, "
smiling.  “W
hat is the somet
hing?” asked h
e.  She grew c
"onfused, glanced"
" round, and, see"
ing the doll she
 had thrown dow
n on one of the 
"tubs, picked it "
up.  “Kiss t
"he doll,” said"
 she.  Borís 
looked attentive
ly and kindly at
" her eager face,"
 but did not re
ply.  “Don�
�t you want to? 
"Well, then, come"
" here,” said s"
"he, and
went fu"
rther in among t
he plants and th
rew down the dol
"l. “Closer,
c"
loser!” she wh
ispered.  She 
caught the young
 officer by his 
"cuffs, and a loo"
k of solemnity a
nd fear appeare
d on her flushed
 face.  “And
 me? Would you l
ike to kiss me?�
�� she whispered
 almost inaudibl
"y,
glancing up "
at him from unde
"r her brows, smi"
"ling, and almost"
 crying from ex
citement.  Bor
ís blushed.  
“How funny you
 are!” he said
", bending down t"
o her and blushi
"ng still
more, "
but he waited an
d did nothing. 
 Suddenly she j
umped up onto a 
tub to be higher
" than he, embrac"
ed him so that 
both her slender
 bare arms clasp
ed him above his
" neck, and, toss"
ing back her ha
"ir, kissed him f"
ull on the lips.
  Then she sli
pped down among 
the flowerpots o
n the other side
 of the tubs an
"d stood, hanging"
 her head.  �
"�Natásha,” he"
" said, “you kn"
ow that I love y
"ou, but....”
"
 “You are in 
love with me?”
 Natásha broke 
"in.

“Yes, I"
" am, but please "
don’t let us d
o like that.... 
In another four 
 years ... then 
I will ask for y
our hand.”  
Natásha conside
red.  “Thirt
"een, fourteen, f"
"ifteen, sixteen,"
” she counted 
on her slender 
little fingers. 
“All right! Th
en it’s settle
d?”  A smile
 of joy and sati
sfaction lit up 
her eager face. 
  “Settled!�
� replied Borís
.  “Forever?
” said the lit
tle girl. “Til
l death itself?�
��  She took h
is arm and with 
a happy face wen
t with him into 
the adjoining s
itting room.  
    CHAPTER 
XIV  After rec
eiving her visit
"ors, the countes"
s was so tired t
hat she gave or
ders to admit no
" more, but the p"
orter was told t
o be sure to inv
ite to dinner a
ll who came “t
o congratulate.�
�� The countess 
wished to have 
a tête-à-tête
 talk with the f
riend of her chi
"ldhood, Princess"
 Anna Mikháylo
"vna, whom she ha"
d not seen prope
rly since she re
turned from Pet
ersburg. Anna Mi
"kháylovna, with"
 her tear-worn b
ut pleasant face
",
drew her chai"
r nearer to that
 of the countess
.  “With you
 I will be quite
" frank,” said "
Anna Mikháylovn
a. “There are
 not many left o
f us old friends
! That’s why I
 so value your 
friendship.” 
 Anna Mikháylo
vna looked at V�
�ra and paused. 
The countess pre
ssed her friend
’s hand.  �
"�Véra,” she s"
aid to her eldes
t daughter who w
as evidently not
" a
favorite, �"
�how is it you h
ave so little ta
ct? Don’t you 
see you are not
 wanted here? Go
 to the other gi
"rls, or...”
"
 The handsome V�
�ra smiled conte
mptuously but di
d not seem at al
l hurt.  “If
 you had told me
" sooner, Mamma, "
I would have gon
"e,” she replie"
d as she rose t
o go to her own 
room.  But as 
she passed the s
itting room she 
noticed two coup
"les sitting,
on"
e pair at each w
indow. She stopp
ed and smiled sc
ornfully. Sónya
 was sitting cl
ose to Nicholas 
who was copying 
out some verses 
"for her, the
fi"
rst he had ever 
written. Borís 
and Natásha wer
e at the other w
indow and cease
d talking when V
éra entered. S�
�nya and Natásh
a looked at Vé
"ra with guilty, "
happy faces.  
It was pleasant 
and touching to 
see these little
 girls in love; 
but apparently 
the sight of the
m roused no plea
sant feeling in 
Véra.  “How
 often have I as
ked you not to t
ake my things?�
� she said. “Y
ou have a room 
"of your own,” "
and she took the
 inkstand from N
icholas.  “I
"n a minute, in a"
" minute,” he s"
"aid, dipping his"
 pen.  “You 
always manage to
 do things at th
"e wrong time,”"
 continued Véra
. “You came r
ushing into the 
drawing room so 
that everyone fe
lt ashamed of y
ou.”  Though
 what she said w
"as quite just, p"
erhaps for that 
very reason no o
"ne
replied, and"
 the four simply
 looked at one a
nother. She ling
ered in the roo
m with the inkst
and in her hand.
  “And at yo
ur age what secr
ets can there be
 between Natásh
"a and
Borís, o"
r between you tw
o? It’s all no
nsense!”  �
"�Now, Véra, wha"
t does it matter
 to you?” said
 Natásha in def
"ense,
speaking "
very gently.  
She seemed that 
day to be more t
han ever kind an
d affectionate t
o everyone.  
"“Very silly,�"
� said Véra. �
�I am ashamed of
 you. Secrets in
deed!”  “A
ll have secrets 
"of their own,”"
 answered Natás
"ha, getting warm"
er. “We don�
�t interfere wit
h you and Berg.�
��  “I shoul
"d think not,” "
"said Véra, “b"
ecause there can
 never be anyth
ing wrong in my 
behavior. But I�
��ll just tell M
amma how you are
 behaving with 
Borís.”  �
�Natálya Ilyní

"y well to me,”"
 remarked Borís
. “I have not
hing to complain
 of.”  “Do
"n’t, Borís! Y"
ou are such a di
plomat that it i
s really tireso
"me,” said Nat�"
�sha in a mortif
ied voice that t
rembled slightly
. (She used the
 word “diploma
"t,” which was "
just then much i
n vogue among t
"he children, in "
the special sens
e they attached 
to it.) “Why 
does she bother 
me?” And she a
"dded, turning to"
" Véra, “You�"
�ll never under
"stand it, becaus"
e you’ve never
 loved anyone. Y
ou have no hear
t! You are a Mad
ame de Genlis an
d nothing more�
� (this nickname
",
bestowed on V"
éra by Nicholas
", was considered"
" very stinging),"
 “and your gr
eatest pleasure 
is to be unpleas
ant to people! G
o and flirt with
 Berg as much a

 she finished qu
ickly.  “I s

"

“Well, now"
 you’ve done w
"hat you wanted,�"
�� put in Nichol
as—“said un
pleasant things 
to everyone and 
upset them. Let�
��s go to the n

"l four, like a f"
lock of scared b

 left the room. 
  “The unplea
sant things were
" said to me,” "
"remarked Véra, "
“I said none 
to anyone.”  
 “Madame de Ge

Genlis!” shout
ed laughing voic
es through the 
door.  The han
"dsome Véra, who"
 produced such a
n irritating and
 unpleasant eff

" smiled and, evi"
dently unmoved b

"
said to her, we"
nt to the lookin

dsome face she s
eemed to become

n the drawing ro

"id the countess,"
 “my life is n

“God grant you

I have not seen

 Prince Vasíli

��What do the d

 to reassure him

�Still the same;

      CHAPT
ER XVI  Pierre
", after all, had"
 not managed to 
choose a career 
for himself in 
"Petersburg, and "
had been expelle
d from there for
 riotous conduct
 and sent to Mo
scow. The story 
told about him a
t Count Rostóv�
��s was true. P
ierre had taken 
part in tying a 
policeman to a b
ear. He had now 
been for some d
ays in Moscow an
d was staying as
 usual at his fa
ther’s house.
 Though he expec
ted that the sto
ry of his escapa
de would be alr
eady known in Mo
scow and that th
e ladies about h
is father—who 
were never favo
rably disposed t
oward him—woul
d have used it t
o turn the coun
"t against him, h"
e nevertheless o
n the day of his
 arrival went to
 his father’s
 part of the hou
se. Entering the
" drawing room, w"
here the prince
sses spent most 
"of their time, h"
e greeted the la
"dies, two of who"
m were sitting 
at embroidery fr
ames while a thi
rd read aloud. I
t was the eldes
t who was readin
g—the one who 
had met Anna Mik
háylovna. The 
two younger ones
 were embroideri
ng: both were ro
sy and pretty an
d they differed
 only in that on
e had a little m
ole on her lip w
hich made her m
uch prettier. Pi
erre was receive
d as if he were 
a corpse or a le
per. The eldest
 princess paused
 in her reading 
and silently sta
red at him with
 frightened eyes
; the second ass
umed precisely t
he same expressi
on; while the y
"oungest, the one"
" with the mole, "
who was of a che
erful and livel
"y disposition, b"
ent over her fra
me to hide a smi
le probably evok
ed by the amusi
ng scene she for
esaw. She drew h
er wool down thr
ough the canvas
" and, scarcely a"
ble to refrain f
"rom laughing, st"
ooped as if tryi
ng to make out 
the pattern.  
“How do you do
", cousin?” sai"
d Pierre. “You
 don’t recogni
ze me?”  �
�I recognize you
" only too well, "
too well.”  
“How is the co
unt? Can I see h
im?” asked Pie
"rre, awkwardly a"
"s usual,
but un"
abashed.  “T
he count is suff
ering physically
" and mentally, a"
nd apparently yo
u have done you
r best to increa
se his mental su
fferings.”  
“Can I see the
 count?” Pierr
e again asked. 
 “Hm.... If y
ou wish to kill 
"him, to kill him"
" outright, you c"
an see him... O
"lga, go and see "
whether Uncle’
s beef tea is re
ady—it is alm
"ost time,” she"
" added, giving P"
ierre to underst
and that they we
"re
busy, and bu"
sy making his fa
ther comfortable
", while evidentl"
"y he,
Pierre, w"
as only busy cau
sing him annoyan
ce.  Olga went
 out. Pierre sto
od looking at th
e sisters; then 
he bowed and sa
id: “Then I wi
ll go to my room
s. You will let 
me know when I c
an see him.” 
  And he left t
"he room, followe"
d by the low but
 ringing laughte
r of the sister
 with the mole. 
  Next day Prin
ce Vasíli had a
rrived and settl
ed in the count�
��s house. He s
ent for Pierre a
nd said to him: 
“My dear fello
"w, if you are go"
ing to behave h
ere as you did i
"n Petersburg, yo"
u will end very 
badly; that is 
all I have to sa
y to you. The co
"unt is very, ver"
"y ill, and you m"
ust not see him
 at all.”  S
ince then Pierre
 had not been di
sturbed and had 
spent the whole 
time in his roo
ms upstairs.  
When Borís appe
ared at his door
 Pierre was paci
ng up and down h
"is room,
stoppi"
ng occasionally 
at a corner to m
ake menacing ges
tures at the wal
"l,
as if runnin"
g a sword throug
h an invisible f
"oe, and glaring "
savagely over h
"is spectacles, a"
nd then again re
"suming his walk,"
 muttering indi
"stinct words, sh"
rugging his shou
lders and gestic
ulating.  “E
ngland is done f
"or,” said he, "
scowling and poi
nting his finger
 at someone uns
een. “Mr. Pitt
", as a traitor t"
o the nation and
 to the rights 
"of man, is sente"
nced to...” Bu
t before Pierre�
��who at that m
oment imagined h
imself to be Nap
oleon in person 
and to have just
 effected the d
angerous crossin
g of the Straits
 of Dover and ca
ptured London�
�could pronounce
 Pitt’s senten
"ce, he saw a wel"
l-built and han
dsome young offi
cer entering his

used. He had lef
t Moscow when B
orís was a boy 
"of fourteen, and"
 had quite forgo
"tten him,
but i"
n his usual impu
lsive and hearty
 way he took Bor
ís by the hand 
 with a friendly
 smile.  “Do
 you remember me
?” asked Borí
s quietly with a
 pleasant smile.
 “I have come
 with my mother 
to see the count
", but it seems h"
e is not well.�
"��

“Yes, it"
 seems he is ill
. People are alw
ays disturbing h
"im,”
answered"
" Pierre, trying "
to remember who 
this young man w
as.  Borís fe
lt that Pierre d
id not recognize
 him but did not
 consider it ne
cessary to intro
"duce himself, an"
d without experi
encing the least
 embarrassment 
looked Pierre st
raight in the fa
ce.  “Count 
Rostóv asks you
 to come to dinn
"er today,” sai"
"d he, after a
c"
onsiderable paus
e which made Pie
rre feel uncomfo
rtable.  “Ah
", Count Rostóv!"
” exclaimed Pi
erre joyfully. �
��Then you are h
"is
son, Ilyá? "
"Only fancy, I di"
dn’t know you 
at first. Do you
 remember how w
e went to the Sp
arrow Hills with
 Madame Jacquot?
... It’s such 
an age...”  
 “You are mist
"aken,” said Bo"
rís deliberatel
"y, with a bold a"
nd slightly sar
castic smile. �
"�I am Borís, so"
n of Princess An
na Mikháylovna
 Drubetskáya. R
"ostóv, the fath"
"er, is Ilyá, an"
d his son is Ni
cholas. I never 
knew any Madame 
Jacquot.”  P
ierre shook his 
head and arms as
 if attacked by 
mosquitoes or be
es.  “Oh dea
"r, what am I thi"
nking about? I�
�ve mixed everyt
hing up. One ha
s so many relati

o you are Borís
? Of course. Wel
"l, now

where we are. An
d what do you th
ink of the Boulo
gne expedition? 
 The English wil
l come off badly
", you know, if N"
apoleon gets acr
oss the Channel
. I think the ex
pedition is quit
e feasible. If o
nly Villeneuve 
doesn’t make a
 mess of things!
”  Borís kn
ew nothing about
 the Boulogne ex
pedition; he did
 not read the p
apers and it was
 the first time 
he had heard Vil
leneuve’s name
.  “We here 
in Moscow are mo
re occupied with
 dinner parties 
and scandal tha
"n with politics,"
” said he in h
is quiet ironica
l tone. “I kno
w nothing about
 it and have not
 thought about i
t. Moscow is chi
efly busy with 
"gossip,” he co"
ntinued. “Just
 now they are ta
lking about you 
and your father
.”  Pierre s
miled in his goo
d-natured way as
 if afraid for h
is companion’s
 sake that the 
latter might say
 something he wo
uld afterwards r
egret. But Bor�
�s spoke distinc
"tly, clearly, an"
"d dryly, looking"
 straight into 
Pierre’s eyes.
  “Moscow ha
s nothing else t
"o do but gossip,"
” Borís went 
on. “Everybod
y is wondering t
o whom the count
 will leave his 
"fortune,
though"
 he may perhaps 
"outlive us all, "
as I sincerely h
ope he will...�
"�

“Yes, it "
is all very horr
"id,” interrupt"
"ed Pierre, “ve"
ry horrid.”  
 Pierre was stil
l afraid that th
is officer might
 inadvertently s
ay something di
sconcerting to h
imself.  “An
d it must seem t
"o you,” said B"
orís flushing s
"lightly, but not"
 changing his t
"one or attitude,"
 “it must seem
 to you that eve
ryone is trying
 to get somethin
g out of the ric
h man?”  “
"So it does,” t"
hought Pierre. 
 “But I just 
"wish to say, to "
avoid misunderst
"andings, that yo"
u are quite mis
taken if you rec
kon me or my mot
her among such p
eople. We are v
"ery poor, but fo"
r my own part at

��t regard mysel
f as a relation 
"of his, and
nei"
ther I nor my mo

�  For a long 
time Pierre coul
d not understand
", but when he di"
"d, he jumped
up"
" from the sofa, "
seized Borís un
der the elbow in
" his quick, clum"
"sy
way, and, bl"
ushing far more 
"than Borís, beg"
an to speak with
 a feeling of m
ingled shame and
 vexation.  �
"�Well, this is s"
trange! Do you s
uppose I... who 
could think?... 
I know very wel
l...”  But B
orís again inte
rrupted him.  
“I am glad I h
ave spoken out f
ully. Perhaps yo

"use me,” said "
"he, putting Pier"

" Well, what answ"

 Will you come t

"

And Borís, "
having apparentl
y relieved himse

became quite "
pleasant again.

“No, but I "

 CHAPTER XVII 
 After Anna Mik
háylovna had dr
iven off with he
r son to visit C
ount Cyril Vlad
ímirovich Bezú
"khov, Countess R"
ostóva sat for 
a long time all 
 alone applying 
her handkerchief
 to her eyes. At
 last she rang. 
  “What is th
e matter with yo
"u, my dear?” s"
he said crossly 
to the maid who
 kept her waitin
g some minutes. 
“Don’t you w
ish to serve me?
 Then I’ll fi
nd you another p
lace.”  The 
countess was ups
et by her friend
’s sorrow and 
humiliating pove
"rty,
and was th"
erefore out of s
"orts, a state of"
 mind which with
 her always fou
nd expression in
 calling her mai
d “my dear” 
and speaking to 
her with exagge
rated politeness
.  “I am ver
"y sorry, ma’am"
",” answered th"
e maid.  “As
k the count to c
ome to me.”  
 The count came 
waddling in to s
ee his wife with
 a rather guilty
 look as usual.
"

“Well, lit"
tle countess? Wh
at a sauté of g
ame au madère w
"e are to
have, "
my dear! I taste
d it. The thousa
nd rubles I paid
 for Tarás were
 not ill-spent.
 He is worth it!
”  He sat do
"wn by his wife, "
his elbows on hi
s knees and his 
hands ruffling 
his gray hair. 
 “What are yo
"ur commands, lit"
tle countess?”
"

“You see, "
my dear... What�
��s that mess?�
"� she said, poin"
ting to his wai
stcoat. “It’
"s the sauté, mo"
"st likely,” sh"
e added with a s
"mile.
“Well, "
"you see, Count, "
I want some mone
y.”  Her fac
e became sad.  
"
“Oh, little c"
ountess!” ... 
and the count be
gan bustling to 
get out his poc
ketbook.  “I
 want a great de
"al, Count! I wan"
t five hundred r
"ubles,” and ta"
king out her ca
mbric handkerchi
ef she began wip

��s waistcoat. 
"
“Yes, immedi"
"ately, immediate"
"ly! Hey, who’s"
 there?” he ca
lled out in a t
one only used by
 persons who are
 certain that th
ose they call wi
ll rush to obey
 the summons. �
�Send Dmítri to
 me!”  Dmít
"ri, a man of goo"
d family who had
 been brought up
 in the count’
s house and now
 managed all his
" affairs, steppe"
d softly into th
e room.  “Th
is is what I wan
"t, my dear fello"
"w,” said the c"
ount to the def
erential young m
an who had enter
ed. “Bring me.
..” he reflect
"ed
a moment, �"
"�yes, bring me s"
even hundred rub

"��Yes, Dmítri, "
"clean ones, plea"

"countess, sighin"
g deeply.  �
�When would you 
"like them, your "
excellency?” a
sked Dmítri. �
�Allow me to in
"form you... But,"
 don’t be unea
"sy,” he added,"
 noticing that 
the count was be
ginning to breat
he heavily and q
uickly which was
 always a sign 
of approaching a
nger. “I was f
orgetting... Do 
you wish it bro
ught at once?”
"

“Yes, yes;"
 just so! Bring 
it. Give it to t
he countess.” 
  “What a tre
asure that Dmít
"ri is,” added "
the count with a
 smile when the
 young man had d
eparted. “Ther
e is never any �
��impossible’ 
with him. That�
��s a thing I ha
te! Everything i
s possible.” 
"
“Ah, money, "
"Count, money! Ho"
w much sorrow it
 causes in the w
"orld,”
said t"
he countess. “
But I am in grea
t need of this s
um.”  “You
", my little coun"
"tess, are a noto"
rious spendthrif
"t,” said the
"
"count, and havin"
g kissed his wif
e’s hand he we
nt back to his s
tudy.  When An
na Mikháylovna 
returned from Co
unt Bezúkhov’
"s the money, all"
 in clean notes
", was lying read"
y under a handke
rchief on the co
untess’ littl
"e table, and Ann"
a Mikháylovna n
oticed that some
thing was agitat
ing her.  “
"Well, my dear?�"
� asked the coun
"tess.

“Oh, "
what a terrible 
state he is in! 
One would not kn
"ow him, he is so"
 ill! I was onl
y there a few mo
ments and hardly
 said a word...�
��  “Annette

"countess
began,"
 with a blush th
at looked very s
trange on her th
"in, dignified,
"
"elderly face, an"
d she took the m
oney from under 
the handkerchief
.  Anna Mikhá
ylovna instantly
 guessed her int
ention and stoop
ed to be ready 
to embrace the c
ountess at the a
ppropriate momen
t.  “This is
 for Borís from
" me, for his out"
fit.”  Anna 
Mikháylovna was
 already embraci
ng her and weepi
ng. The countess
 wept too. They
 wept because th
"ey were friends,"
 and because the
y were kindhear
"ted, and because"
 they—friends 
from childhood�
�had to think a
bout such a base
" thing as money,"
 and because the
ir youth was ove

 tears were plea

APTER XVIII  C
ountess Rostóva
", with her daugh"
ters and a large
 number of guest
"s, was
already "
seated in the dr
awing room. The 
count took the g
entlemen into h
is study and sho
wed them his cho
ice collection o
f Turkish pipes.
 From time to t
ime he went out 
to ask: “Hasn�
��t she come yet
?” They were 
expecting Márya
 Dmítrievna Akh
"rosímova, known"
 in society as l
e terrible drag
"on, a lady disti"
nguished not for
" wealth or rank,"
 but for common
 sense and frank
 plainness of sp
eech. Márya Dm�
�trievna was kno
wn to the Imper
ial family as we
ll as to all Mos
cow and Petersbu
"rg, and both
ci"
ties wondered at
" her, laughed pr"
ivately at her r
"udenesses, and t"
old good storie
"s about her, whi"
le none the less
 all without exc
eption respecte
d and feared her
.  In the coun
"t’s room, whic"
h was full of to
"bacco smoke, the"
y talked of the
 war that had be
en announced in 
"a manifesto, and"
 about the recr
uiting. None of 
them had yet see
"n the manifesto,"
 but they all kn
ew it had appea
red. The count s
at on the sofa b
etween two guest
s who were smok
ing and talking.
 He neither smok
"ed nor talked, b"
ut bending his h
ead first to on
e side and then 
to the other wat
ched the smokers
 with evident p
leasure and list
ened to the conv
ersation of his 
"two neighbors, w"
hom he egged on
 against each ot
her.  One of t
hem was a sallow
", clean-shaven c"
ivilian with a t
hin and wrinkled
"
face, already "
"growing old, tho"
ugh he was dress
ed like a most f
ashionable youn
g man. He sat wi
th his legs up o
n the sofa as if
 quite at home a
"nd,
having stuc"
k an amber mouth
piece far into h
"is mouth, was in"
haling the smok
e spasmodically 
and screwing up 
his eyes. This w
as an old bachel
"or,
Shinshín, "
a cousin of the 
"countess’, a m"
an with “a sha
rp tongue” as
 they said in Mo
scow society. He
 seemed to be co
ndescending to 
his companion. T
"he latter, a fre"
"sh, rosy officer"
" of the Guards,"
 irreproachably 
"washed, brushed,"
" and buttoned, h"
eld his pipe in 
the middle of h
is mouth and wit
h red lips gentl
y inhaled the sm
"oke, letting
it"
 escape from his
 handsome mouth 
in rings. This w
as Lieutenant Be
"rg, an
officer "
in the Semënov 
regiment with wh
om Borís was to
 travel to join 
"
the army, and a"
bout whom Natás
ha had teased he
r elder sister V
"éra,
speaking "
of Berg as her �
��intended.” T
he count sat bet
ween them and l
istened attentiv
ely. His favorit
e occupation whe
n not playing bo
"ston, a
card ga"
me he was very f
"ond of, was that"
" of listener, es"
pecially when he
 succeeded in s
etting two loqua
cious talkers at
 one another.  
"
“Well, then, "
"old chap, mon tr"
ès honorable Al
phonse Kárlovic
"h,”
said Shin"
"shín, laughing "
ironically and m
ixing the most o
rdinary Russian 
 expressions wit
h the choicest F
rench phrases—
which was a pecu
liarity of his 
speech. “Vous 
comptez vous fai

��       * You

“No, Peter"
 Nikoláevich; I
 only want to sh
ow that in the c
avalry the adva
ntages are far l
ess than in the 
infantry. Just c
onsider my own 
"position now, Pe"
ter Nikoláevich
...”  Berg a
lways spoke quie
"tly, politely, a"
nd with great pr
ecision. His co
nversation alway
s related entire
ly to himself; h
e would remain c
alm and silent 
when the talk re
lated to any top
ic that had no d
irect bearing o
n himself. He co
uld remain silen
t for hours with
out being at all
 put out of cou
ntenance himself
 or making other
"s uncomfortable,"
 but as soon as
 the conversatio
n concerned hims
elf he would beg
in to talk circ
umstantially and
 with evident sa
tisfaction.  �
��Consider my po

koláevich. Were
 I in the cavalr
y I should get 
not more than tw
o hundred rubles
 every four mont

 is I receive tw

"hirty,” said h"
"e, looking at Sh"
inshín and the 
count with a joy
"ful,
pleasant s"
"mile, as if it w"
ere obvious to h
im that his succ
ess must always
 be the chief de
sire of everyone

 I even manage t

aside and to sen

"went on,

  “La balanc

"ed Shinshín, mo"
ving his pipe to

 of his mouth an
d winking at the
 count.       
 * So that squar
es matters.  T
he count burst o
ut laughing. The
 other guests se
eing that Shinsh
ín was talking
 came up to list
"en. Berg, oblivi"
ous of irony or 
"indifference,
c"
ontinued to expl
ain how by excha
nging into the G
uards he had alr
eady gained a s
tep on his old c
omrades of the C
adet Corps; how 
in wartime the 
company commande
r might get kill
"ed and he, as se"
nior in the comp
"any,
might easi"
ly succeed to th
e post; how popu
lar he was with 
everyone in the
" regiment, and h"
ow satisfied his
 father was with
 him. Berg evide
ntly enjoyed na
rrating all this
", and did not se"
em to suspect th
"at others,
too,"
 might have thei
r own interests.
 But all he said
 was so prettily
"
sedate, and th"
e naïveté of h
is youthful egot
ism was so obvio
"us, that
he dis"
armed his hearer
"s.

“Well, m"
"y boy, you’ll "
get along wherev
er you go—foot
 or horse—tha
t I’ll warrant
",” said Shinsh"
"ín, patting him"
 on the shoulde
r and taking his
 feet off the so
fa.  Berg smil
ed joyously. The
" count, followed"
" by his guests, "
went into the d
rawing room.  
It was just the 
moment before a 
big dinner when 
the assembled gu
"ests,
expecting"
 the summons to 
"zakúska, * avoi"
d engaging in an
y long conversa
tion but think i
t necessary to m
ove about and ta
"lk, in order
to"
 show that they

ook toward the d

"one another,
an"
d the visitors t
ry to guess from
 these glances w
"ho, or what, the"

innertime and wa
s sitting awkwar
dly in the midd
le of the drawin
g room on the fi

b"
locking the way 
for everyone. Th
e countess tried
 to make him tal
"k,
but he went "
on naïvely look
ing around throu
gh his spectacle
s as if in sear
ch of somebody a
nd answered all 
her questions in
 monosyllables. 
He was in the w
ay and was the o
nly one who did 
not notice the f
act. Most of th
"e guests, knowin"
g of the affair 
"with the bear, l"
ooked with curio
sity at this bi
"g, stout, quiet "
"man, wondering h"
ow such a clumsy
", modest
fellow"
 could have play
ed such a prank 
on a policeman. 
  “You have o

ess asked him. 
"
“Oui, madame"
",” replied he,"
 looking around 
him.  “You h
ave not yet seen

"

“Non, madam"
e.” He smiled 
quite inappropri
ately.  “You
 have been in Pa

believe? I suppo

  “Very inter

e countess excha

 understood that
 she was being a

sitting d"
own beside him s
he began to spea

had the countess

all conversing w

 “The Razumóv

“Well, I "

Berg gave his ar

After them other
 couples followe

"
whole dining hal

ed singly. The f
ootmen began mov

"s scraped, the
"
band struck up i
"n the gallery, a"
nd the guests se
ttled down in th
eir places. The
n the strains of
 the count’s h
ousehold band we
re replaced by 
the clatter of k
"nives and forks,"
 the voices of v
"isitors, and the"
 soft steps of 
the footmen. At 
one end of the t
able sat the cou
ntess with Már
ya Dmítrievna o
n her right and 
Anna Mikháylovn
"a on her left, t"
he other lady v
isitors were far
ther down. At th
e other end sat 
"the count,
with"
 the hussar colo
nel on his left 
and Shinshín an
d the other male
 visitors on hi
s right. Midway 
down the long ta

sat the grown-u
p young people: 
Véra beside Ber
"g, and Pierre be"
side Borís; and
 on the other s
"ide, the childre"
"n, tutors, and g"
overnesses. From
 behind the cry
stal decanters a
"nd fruit vases, "
the count kept g
lancing at his 
wife and her tal
l cap with its l
ight-blue ribbon

lled his neighb

not neglecting h
is own. The coun
"tess in turn,
w"
ithout omitting 
her duties as ho
"stess, threw sig"
nificant glances
 from behind th
e pineapples at 
her husband whos
e face and bald 
head seemed by 
their redness to
 contrast more t
han usual with h
is gray hair. At
 the ladies’ 
end an even chat
ter of voices wa
s heard all the 
"time, at the
me"
n’s end the vo
ices sounded lou
"der and louder, "
especially that 
of the colonel 
"of hussars who, "
growing more and
" more flushed, a"
te and drank so 
 much that the c
ount held him up
 as a pattern to
 the other guest
s. Berg with te
nder smiles was 
saying to Véra 
that love is not
 an earthly but 
 a heavenly feel
ing. Borís was 
telling his new 
friend Pierre wh
o the guests we
re and exchangin
g glances with N
"atásha, who was"
 sitting opposi

 little but exam
ined the new fac
"es, and ate a
g"
reat deal. Of th
e two soups he c
hose turtle with
 savory patties 
and went on to 
the game without
 omitting a sing
le dish or one o
f the wines. Th
ese latter the b
utler thrust mys
teriously forwar
"d, wrapped in a"
"
napkin, from be"
hind the next ma
n’s shoulders 
and whispered: �
��Dry Madeira�
�... “Hungaria

he case might b
e. Of the four c
rystal glasses e
ngraved with the
 count’s monog
ram that stood 
before his plate
", Pierre held ou"
t one at random 
and drank with 
"enjoyment, gazin"
g with ever-incr
easing amiabilit

guests. Natásha
", who sat opposi"
"te, was looking "
at Borís as gir
ls of thirteen 
look at the boy 
they are in love
 with and have j
ust kissed for 
the first time. 
Sometimes that s
ame look fell on
" Pierre, and tha"
t funny lively 
little girl’s 
look made him in
clined to laugh 
without knowing 
 why.  Nichola
s sat at some di
stance from Són

" Karágina, to

whom he was agai

evidently tormen

 now she turned 
"
pale, now blush"
ed and strained 
every nerve to o
verhear what Nic

 were saying to 
one another. The
 governess kept 
looking round u
neasily as if pr
eparing to resen
t any slight tha

not want any of

at it was not to

", holding his ca"

t himself with d
ifficulty from 
dropping into hi
s usual after-di
"nner nap, and la"
ughed at everyth
ing. The young 
"people, at the c"
ountess’ insti
"gation, gathered"
 round the clav
ichord and harp.
 Julie by genera
l request played
 first. After sh
e had played a 
little air with 
variations on th
"e harp, she join"
ed the other yo
ung ladies in be
gging Natásha a
"nd Nicholas, who"
 were noted for 
 their musical t
"alent, to sing s"
omething. Natás
"ha, who was trea"
ted as though s
he were grown up
", was evidently "
very proud of th
is but at the s
ame time felt sh
y.  “What sh
all we sing?” 
she said.  “
"‘The Brook,’"
” suggested Ni
cholas.  “We
"ll, then, let’"
s be quick. Bor�
"�s, come here,�"
� said Natásha.
 “But where i
s Sónya?”  
She looked round
 and seeing that
 her friend was 
not in the room 
ran to look for
 her.  Running
 into Sónya’s
 room and not fi
"nding her there,"
 Natásha ran to
"
the nursery, b"
ut Sónya was no
t there either. 
Natásha conclud
ed that she mus
t be on the ches
t in the passage
. The chest in t
he passage was 
the place of mou
rning for the yo
unger female gen
eration in the R
ostóv househol
d. And there in 
fact was Sónya 
lying face downw
ard on Nurse’s
 dirty feather 
bed on the top o
"f the chest, cru"
mpling her gauzy
 pink dress und
"er her, hiding h"
er face with her
 slender fingers
", and sobbing
s"
o convulsively t
hat her bare lit

ook. Natásha’
"s
face, which h"
ad been so radia

cha"
nged: her eyes b
"ecame fixed, and"
 then a shiver p
assed down her b
road neck and t
he corners of he
r mouth drooped.
  “Sónya! W
hat is it? What 
is the matter?..
. Oo... Oo... Oo
...!” And Nat
ásha’s large 
"mouth widened, m"
aking her look q
"uite ugly, and s"
he began to wai
l like a baby wi
thout knowing wh
"y, except that S"
ónya was cryin
g. Sónya tried 
to lift her head
 to answer but c
"ould not, and
h"
id her face stil
l deeper in the 
bed. Natásha we
"pt, sitting on t"
he blue-striped
 feather bed and
 hugging her fri
end. With an eff
ort Sónya sat 
up and began wip
ing her eyes and
 explaining.  
“Nicholas is g
oing away in a w
"eek’s time, hi"
s... papers... h
ave come... he 
told me himself.
.. but still I s
"hould not cry,�"
� and she showe

��t... no one ca

he began to cry 
again because he
 had such a nobl
e soul.  “It
’s all very we

am not envious..
. I love you and
"
Borís also,�"
"� she went on, g"
aining a little 
strength; “he

the countess as

alled her so) �
�that I am spoil

 I am so gratefu

�  Sónya coul
"d not continue, "
and again hid he

feather bed. Nat
ásha began cons

er face showed t
hat she underst
ood all the grav
ity of her frien
d’s trouble. 
"
“Sónya,” "
she suddenly exc
"laimed, as if sh"
e had guessed th
e true reason o
f her friend’s
" sorrow, “I’"
m sure Véra has
 said something 
 to you since di
nner? Hasn’t s
he?”  “Yes
", these verses N"
icholas wrote hi
mself and I copi
"ed some others,"
 and she found t
hem on my table 
and said she’d
 show them to Ma

that I"
" was ungrateful,"
 and that Mamma 
would never allo
w him to marry 
"me, but that he�"
��ll marry Julie
. You see how he
’s been with h
er all day... N
"atásha, what ha"
ve I done to des
erve it?...” 
 And again she 
"began to sob, mo"
re bitterly than
 before. Natásh
a lifted her up
", hugged her, an"
"d, smiling throu"
"gh her tears, be"
gan comforting 
her.  “Sóny
"a, don’t belie"

 Don’t believe

 I don’t quit

but don’t you

 could all be a

nice it all was?
 There’s Uncle
 Shinshín’s b

ied his first co

 only second cou
"sins, you know."
 And Borís says
 it is quite pos
sible. You know 
I have told him 
all about it. A
nd he is so clev
er and so good!�
�� said Natásha
. “Don’t yo
"u cry, Sónya, d"
"ear love, darlin"
g Sónya!” and
 she kissed her 
and laughed. �
�Véra’s spite

her! And all wil

  Natásha kis
sed her on the h

"wered Natásha, "
pushing in a cri

"“Well, let’s"

  “Come alon

"d
Natásha, sto"

“I feel so hap

Sónya,"
 shaking off som

cking away the

som of her dress
 close to her bo

 ran after Nat�
�sha down the pa

 flushed face a
"nd light, joyous"
 steps. At the v
isitors’ reque
st the young peo
ple sang the qu
"artette, “The "
"Brook,” with w"
hich everyone wa
s delighted. Th
en Nicholas sang
 a song he had j
ust learned:  
   At nighttime 
in the moon’s 
fair glow      
"How sweet, as fa"

   To feel t"

" unspoilt,

 But oh! till th

!...  He had n
ot finished the 
last verse befor
e the young peop
le began to get
 ready to dance 
in the large hal
"l, and the sound"
 of the feet and
 the coughing o
f the musicians 
were heard from 
the gallery.  
 Pierre was sit

ing room where S
hinshín had eng
"aged him,
as a "
man recently ret
urned from abroa
"d, in a politica"
l conversation i

 others joined b
ut which bored P

music began Nat
ásha came in an
d walking straig
ht up to Pierre 
"said, laughing a"
nd blushing:  
 “Mamma told m
e to ask you to 
join the dancers
.”  “I am 
afraid of mixing
" the figures,”"
 Pierre replied;
 “but if you 
will be my teach
er...” And low
ering his big ar
m he offered it 
to the slender 
little girl.  
While the couple
s were arranging
 themselves and 
the musicians tu
"ning up,
Pierre"
 sat down with h
is little partne
r. Natásha was 
perfectly happy;
 she was dancin
g with a grown-u
"p man, who had b"
een abroad. She 
was sitting in 
a conspicuous pl
ace and talking 
to him like a gr
own-up lady. Sh
e had a fan in h
er hand that one
 of the ladies h
ad given her to 
hold. Assuming 
quite the pose o
f a society woma
n (heaven knows 
when and where 
she had learned 
it) she talked w
"ith her partner,"
 fanning herself
 and smiling ov
er the fan.  �
"��Dear, dear! Ju"
st look at her!�
�� exclaimed the
 countess as she
 crossed the ba
"llroom, pointing"
 to Natásha.  
 Natásha blushe
d and laughed. 
"
“Well, reall"

ould you? What i
s there to be su

   In the mids
t of the third �
�cossaise there 
was a clatter of

e sitting room w
here the count a

came Márya Dmí

count,"
 with playful ce
remony somewhat 
"in ballet style,"
 offered his be

 Dmítrievna. He
 drew himself up
", a smile of deb"

 lit up his face
 and as soon as 
the last figure

 clapped his han

 Do you know the

��  This was t
he count’s fav

 in his youth. 
(Strictly speaki

 of the anglaise
.)  “Look at
 Papa!” shoute
d Natásha to th
"e whole company,"
 and quite forg
etting that she 
was dancing with
 a grown-up part
ner she bent her
 curly head to 
her knees and ma
de the whole roo

laughter.  And
 indeed everybod
y in the room lo
oked with a smil
e of pleasure at
 the jovial old
" gentleman, who "
standing beside 
his tall and sto
"ut partner,
Má"
"rya Dmítrievna,"
 curved his arms
", beat time, str"
aightened his s

" out his toes, t"
apped gently wit
"h his foot, and,"
 by a smile tha
t broadened his 
round face more 
"and more, prepar"
ed the onlooker
s for what was t
o follow. As soo
n as the provoca
tively gay stra
ins of Daniel Co
oper (somewhat r
esembling those 
of a merry peasa
nt dance) began
" to sound, all t"
he doorways of t
he ballroom were
 suddenly fille
d by the domesti
c serfs—the me
n on one side an
d the women on 
the other—who 
with beaming fac
es had come to s
ee their master 
making merry. 
 “Just look a
t the master! A 
regular eagle he
 is!” loudly r
emarked the nur
"se, as she stood"
 in one of the d
oorways.  The 
count danced wel
l and knew it. B
ut his partner c
ould not and did
 not want to da

owerful arms ha

had handed her r
eticule to the c

by the whole of 
the count’s pl

árya Dmítrievn
a found express
ion only in her 
more and more be
aming face and q
uivering nose. 
But if the count
", getting more a"
nd more into the
" swing of it, ch"
armed the spect
ators by the une
xpectedness of h
is adroit maneuv

lity with which 
he capered about
 on his light fe

Dmí"
trievna produced
 no less impress
ion by slight ex
ertions—the le
ast effort to m
ove her shoulder
s or bend her ar
"ms when turning,"
 or stamp her f
oot—which ever
yone appreciated
 in view of her 
size and habitua

 dance grew live
lier and livelie
r. The other cou
ples could not 
attract a moment
’s attention t
o their own evol

ot even try to 
do so. All were

was they never t

In the intervals

 CHAPTER XXI  
While in the Ros
tóvs’ ballroo
m the sixth angl
aise was being d
"anced,
to a tun"
e in which the w
eary musicians b
"lundered, and wh"
ile tired footm
en and cooks wer
e getting the su
"pper, Count Bez�"
�khov had a six
th stroke. The d
octors pronounce
d recovery impos
sible. After a m
"ute
confession,"
 communion was a
dministered to t
"he dying man, pr"
eparations made
 for the sacrame
"nt of unction, a"
nd in his house 
there was the bu
stle and thrill
 of suspense usu
al at such momen
ts. Outside the 
"house, beyond
t"
"he gates, a grou"
p of undertakers
", who hid whenev"
er a carriage dr
"ove up,
waited "
in expectation o
f an important o
rder for an expe
nsive funeral. 
The Military Gov
"ernor of Moscow,"
 who had been as
siduous in sendi
ng aides-de-cam
p to inquire aft
er the count’s
" health, came hi"
mself that even
ing to bid a las
t farewell to th
e celebrated gra
ndee of Catheri
"ne’s court, Co"
unt Bezúkhov. 
 The magnificen
t reception room
 was crowded. Ev
eryone stood up 
 respectfully wh
en the Military 
"Governor, having"
 stayed about ha
lf an hour alon
e with the dying
" man, passed out"
", slightly ackno"
wledging their 
bows and trying 
to escape as qui
ckly as possible
 from the glance
s fixed on him 
"by the doctors, "
"clergy, and rela"
tives of the fam
ily. Prince Vas
"íli, who had gr"
own thinner and 
paler during the
" last few days,"
 escorted him to
" the door, repea"
ting something t
o him several ti
mes in low tone
s.  When the M
ilitary Governor
" had gone, Princ"
e Vasíli sat do
wn all alone on
 a chair in the 
"ballroom, crossi"
ng one leg high 
"over the other,"
 leaning his elb
ow on his knee a
nd covering his 
face with his ha
nd. After sitti
ng so for a whil
"e he rose, and, "
looking about hi
m with frightene
"d
eyes, went wi"
th unusually hur
ried steps down 
the long corrido
r leading to th
e back of the ho
"use, to the room"
 of the eldest p
rincess.  Thos
e who were in th
e dimly lit rece
ption room spoke
 in nervous whi
"spers, and, when"
ever anyone went
 into or came fr
om the dying man
"’s
room, grew"
 silent and gaze
d with eyes full
 of curiosity or
 expectancy at 
"his door, which "
creaked slightly
 when opened.  
 “The limits o
f human life ...
 are fixed and m
ay not be o’e
"rpassed,” said"
 an old priest t
o a lady who had
 taken a seat b
eside him and wa
s listening naï
vely to his word
s.  “I wonde
"r, is it not too"
 late to adminis
ter unction?” 
"asked the
lady,"
 adding the prie
st’s clerical 
"title, as if she"
 had no opinion 
of her own on t
he subject.  �
"��Ah, madam, it "
is a great sacra
"ment,” replied"
" the priest, pas"
sing his hand o
ver the thin gri
zzled strands of
 hair combed bac
k across his ba
ld head.  “W
ho was that? The
 Military Govern
or himself?” w
as being asked a
t the other sid
e of the room. �
��How young-look
ing he is!”  
"
“Yes, and he "
is over sixty. I
 hear the count 
no longer recogn
izes anyone. Th
ey wished to adm
inister the sacr
ament of unction
.”  “I kne
w someone who re
ceived that sacr
ament seven time
s.”  The sec
ond princess had
 just come from 
the sickroom wit
h her eyes red 
from weeping and
 sat down beside
" Dr. Lorrain, wh"
o was sitting in
 a graceful pos
e under a portra
"it of Catherine,"
 leaning his elb
ow on a table. 
"

“Beautiful,"
” said the doc
tor in answer to
 a remark about 
the weather. �
�The weather is 
"beautiful, Princ"
ess; and besides
", in Moscow
one"
 feels as if one
 were in the cou
ntry.”  “Y
"es, indeed,” r"
eplied the princ
ess with a sigh.
 “So he may ha
ve something to
 drink?”  Lo
rrain considered
.  “Has he t
aken his medicin
e?”  “Yes.
”  The docto
r glanced at his
 watch.  “Ta
ke a glass of bo
iled water and p
ut a pinch of cr
"eam of tartar,�"
� and he indica
ted with his del
icate fingers wh
at he meant by a
 pinch.  “De
re has neffer be
"en a gase,” a "
German doctor wa
s saying to an 
"aide-de-camp, �"
�dat one liffs a
fter de sird str
oke.”  “An
d what a well-pr
eserved man he w
as!” remarked 
the aide-de-camp
. “And who wi
ll inherit his w
ealth?” he add
ed in a whisper.
  “It von’
"t go begging,”"
 replied the Ger
man with a smile
.  Everyone ag
ain looked towar
"d the door, whic"
h creaked as the
 second princes
s went in with t
he drink she had
 prepared accord
ing to Lorrain�
��s instructions
. The German doc
tor went up to L
orrain.  “Do
 you think he ca
n last till morn
ing?” asked th
"e German,
addre"
ssing Lorrain in
 French which he
 pronounced badl
"y.

Lorrain, p"
ursing up his li
"ps, waved a seve"
rely negative fi
nger before his
 nose.  “Ton
"ight, not later,"
” said he in a
" low voice, and "
he moved away w
ith a decorous s
mile of self-sat
isfaction at bei
ng able clearly 
to understand a
nd state the pat
ient’s conditi
on.  Meanwhile
 Prince Vasíli 
had opened the d
oor into the pri
ncess’ room. 
 In this room i
t was almost dar
k; only two tiny
 lamps were burn
ing before the 
icons and there 
was a pleasant s
cent of flowers 
and burnt pastil
les. The room w
as crowded with 
small pieces of 
"furniture, whatn"
"ots,
cupboards,"
 and little tabl
es. The quilt of
" a high, white f"
eather bed was 
just visible beh
ind a screen. A 
small dog began 
to bark.  “A
"h, is it you, co"
usin?”  She 
rose and smoothe
"d her hair, whic"
h was as usual s
o extremely smoo
th that it seem
ed to be made of
 one piece with 
her head and cov
ered with varni
sh.  “Has an
ything happened?
” she asked. �
��I am so terrif
ied.”  “No
", there is no ch"
ange. I only cam
e to have a talk
" about business,"
"
Catiche,” * "
muttered the pri
"nce, seating him"
self wearily on 
the chair she h
ad just vacated.
 “You have mad
e the place warm
", I must say,”"
 he remarked. �
"��Well, sit down"
: let’s have a
 talk.”     
  *Catherine.  
 “I thought pe
rhaps something 
"had happened,”"
 she said with h
er unchanging s
tonily severe ex
"pression; and, s"
itting down oppo
site the prince
", she prepared t"
o listen.  “
I wished to get 
"a nap, mon cousi"
"n, but I can’t"
".”

“Well,"
 my dear?” sai
d Prince Vasíli
", taking her han"
d and bending it
 downwards as w
as his habit.  
 It was plain th
at this “well?
” referred to 
much that they b
oth understood 
without naming. 
"

The princess,"
 who had a strai
"ght, rigid body,"
 abnormally long
" for her
legs, "
looked directly 
at Prince Vasíl
i with no sign o
f emotion in her
 prominent gray
 eyes. Then she 
shook her head a
nd glanced up at
 the icons with
 a sigh. This mi
ght have been ta
ken as an expres
sion of sorrow 
"and devotion, or"
 of weariness an
d hope of restin
g before long. P
rince Vasíli u
nderstood it as 
an expression of
 weariness.  �
��And I?” he s
aid; “do you t
hink it is easie
r for me? I am a
s worn out as a
" post horse, but"
 still I must ha
ve a talk with y
"ou, Catiche, a
"
very serious tal
k.”  Prince 
Vasíli said no 
more and his che
eks began to twi
"tch nervously,
"
"now on one side,"
 now on the othe
"r, giving his fa"
ce an unpleasant
 expression whi
ch was never to 
be seen on it in
 a drawing room.
 His eyes too s
eemed strange; a
t one moment the
y looked impuden
tly sly and at t
he next glanced
 round in alarm.
  The princess
", holding her li"
ttle dog on her 
lap with her thi
"n bony
hands, l"
ooked attentivel
y into Prince Va
síli’s eyes e
vidently resolv
ed not to be the
 first to break 
"silence, if she "
had to wait till
 morning.  �
"�Well, you see, "
my dear princess
" and cousin, Cat"
herine Semënovn
"a,”
continued"
" Prince Vasíli,"
 returning to hi
"s theme, apparen"
tly not without
 an inner strugg
le; “at such a
 moment as this 
one must think 
of everything. O
ne must think of
" the future, of "
all of you... I 
"love you
all, l"
ike children of 
"my own, as you k"
now.”  The p
rincess continue
d to look at him
" without moving,"
 and with the sa
me dull express
ion.  “And t
hen of course my
 family has also
 to be considere
"d,” Prince
Va"
"síli went on, t"
estily pushing a
way a little tab
le without looki
ng at her. “Y
"ou know, Catiche"
", that we—you "
"three sisters, M"
"ámontov, and
m"
y wife—are the
 count’s only 
direct heirs. I 
"know, I know how"
 hard it is for
 you to talk or 
think of such ma
tters. It is no 
easier for me; 
"but, my dear, I "
am getting on fo
r sixty and must
 be prepared for
 anything. Do y
ou know I have s
ent for Pierre? 
"The count,” po"
inting to his p
"ortrait, “defi"
nitely demanded 
that he should b
e called.”  
Prince Vasíli l
ooked questionin
gly at the princ
"ess, but could n"
ot make out whe
ther she was con
sidering what he
 had just said o
r whether she wa
s simply lookin
g at him.  “
There is one thi
ng I constantly 
pray God to gran
"t, mon cousin,�"
"� she
replied, "
“and it is tha
t He would be me
rciful to him an
d would allow h
is noble soul pe
acefully to leav
e this...”  
"“Yes, yes, of "
"course,” inter"
rupted Prince Va
síli impatientl
"y,
rubbing his "
bald head and an
grily pulling ba
ck toward him th
e little table 
that he had push
ed away. “But.
".. in short, the"
 fact is... you 
 know yourself t
hat last winter 
the count made a
 will by which h
e left all his 
"property, not to"
 us his direct h
"eirs, but to Pie"
rre.”  “He
 has made wills 
enough!” quiet
ly remarked the 
princess. “But
 he cannot leav
e the estate to 
Pierre. Pierre i
s illegitimate.�
"��

“But, my"
" dear,” said P"
rince Vasíli su
"ddenly, clutchin"
g the little ta
ble and becoming
 more animated a
nd talking more 
rapidly: “what
 if a letter ha
s been written t
o the Emperor in
 which the count
 asks for Pierr
e’s legitimati
on? Do you under
stand that in co
nsideration of t
he count’s se
"rvices, his requ"
est would be gra
nted?...”  T
he princess smil
ed as people do 
who think they k
now more about t
he subject unde
r discussion tha
n those they are
 talking with. 
 “I can tell 
"you more,” con"
tinued Prince Va
"síli, seizing h"
"er hand,
“tha"
t letter was wri
"tten, though it "
"was not sent, an"
d the Emperor kn
ew of it. The o
"nly question is,"
 has it been des
troyed or not? I
"f not, then
as "
soon as all is o
"ver,” and Prin"
ce Vasíli sighe
d to intimate wh
at he meant by 
the words all is
" over, “and th"
e count’s pape
"rs are opened,
"
the will and let
ter will be deli
vered to the Emp
"eror, and the pe"
tition will cer
tainly be grante
d. Pierre will g
et everything as
 the legitimate 
 son.”  “A
nd our share?”
 asked the princ
ess smiling iron
"ically, as if
a"
nything might ha
"ppen, only not t"
"hat.

“But, "
"my poor Catiche,"
 it is as clear 
as daylight! He 
will then be the
 legal heir to 
everything and y
ou won’t get a
nything. You mus
"t know,
my dear"
", whether the wi"
ll and letter we
"re written, and "
whether they hav
e been destroye
d or not. And if
 they have someh
ow been overlook
"ed, you
ought t"
o know where the
"y are, and must "
"find them, becau"
se...”  “W
hat next?” the
 princess interr
"upted, smiling s"
ardonically and 
not changing th
e expression of 
her eyes. “I a
"m a woman, and y"
ou think we are
 all stupid; but
 I know this: an
 illegitimate so
n cannot inherit
... un bâtard!
"”* she added, "
as if supposing 
that this transl
ation of the wo
rd would effecti
vely prove to Pr
ince Vasíli the
 invalidity of h
is contention. 
       * A bast
"ard.

“Well,"
" really, Catiche"
! Can’t you un
derstand! You ar
e so intelligen
"t, how is it you"
 don’t see tha
t if the count h
as written a le
tter to the Empe
ror begging him 
to recognize Pie
rre as legitimat
"e, it
follows t"
hat Pierre will 
not be Pierre bu
t will become Co
"unt Bezúkhov,
"
and will then in
herit everything
 under the will?
 And if the will
 and letter are
" not destroyed, "
then you will ha
ve nothing but t
he consolation 
of having been d
utiful et tout c
e qui s’ensuit
!* That’s cert
ain.”       
* And all that f
ollows therefrom
.  “I know t
he will was made
", but I also kno"
w that it is inv
"alid;
and you, "
"mon cousin, seem"
 to consider me 
"a perfect fool,�"
�� said the pri
ncess with the e
xpression women 
assume when they
 suppose they ar
e saying someth
ing witty and st
inging.  “My
 dear Princess C

”  At this a
 sudden change e
vidently took pl

er thin lips gre
"w white, though "

" change, and her"
 voice when she
 began to speak 
passed through s
uch transitions 
as she herself 
evidently did no
t expect.  “
That would be a 
fine thing!” s
aid she. “I ne

"��

“Yes, bu"

"“Yes, I knew i"

“Yes, I was"

 held her by the

the air of one w

“There is stil

     CHAPTER
 XXII  While t
hese conversatio
ns were going on
 in the receptio
n room and the 
princess’ room
", a carriage con"
taining Pierre (
who had been sen
t for) and Anna
 Mikháylovna (w
ho found it nece
ssary to accompa
ny him) was dri
ving into the co
urt of Count Bez
úkhov’s house
. As the wheels 
 rolled softly o
ver the straw be
neath the window
"s, Anna Mikháyl"
"ovna,
having tu"
rned with words 
of comfort to he
"r companion, rea"
lized that he w
as asleep in his
 corner and woke
 him up. Rousing
" himself, Pierre"
 followed Anna 
Mikháylovna out
 of the carriage
", and only then "
began to think 
of the interview
 with his dying 
father which awa
ited him. He no
ticed that they 
had not come to 
the front entran
ce but to the ba
ck door. While 
he was getting d
own from the car
riage steps two 
"men, who
looked"
 like tradespeop
"le, ran hurriedl"
y from the entra
nce and hid in t
he shadow of th
e wall. Pausing 
"for a moment, Pi"
erre noticed sev
eral other men 
of the same kind
 hiding in the s
hadow of the hou
se on both sides
. But neither A
nna Mikháylovna
 nor the footman
 nor the coachma
"n, who
could no"
t help seeing th
"ese people, took"
 any notice of t
hem. “It seems
 to be all righ
"t,” Pierre con"
"cluded, and foll"
owed Anna Mikhá
ylovna. She hur
riedly ascended 
the narrow dimly
 lit stone stair
"case, calling to"
"
Pierre, who wa"
s lagging behind
", to follow. Tho"
ugh he did not s
ee why it was n
ecessary for him
 to go to the co
"unt at all, stil"
l less why he ha
d to go by the 
"back stairs, yet"
 judging by Anna
 Mikháylovna’
s air of assura
"nce and haste, P"
ierre concluded 
that it was all 
absolutely nece
ssary. Halfway u
p the stairs the
y were almost kn
ocked over by s
"ome men who, car"
"rying pails, cam"
e running downst
"airs, their boot"
s clattering. T
hese men pressed
 close to the wa
ll to let Pierre
 and Anna Mikh�
�ylovna pass and
 did not evince 
the least surpri
se at seeing the
m there.  “
Is this the way 
to the princesse
s’ apartments?
” asked Anna 
Mikháylovna of 
one of them.  
"“Yes,” repli"
ed a footman in 
a bold loud voic
"e, as if anythin"
g were now perm
issible; “the 
door to the left
", ma’am.”
"
 “Perhaps the 
count did not as
"k for me,” sai"
d Pierre when he
 reached the la
nding. “I’d 
better go to my 
own room.”  
Anna Mikháylovn
a paused and wai
ted for him to c
ome up.  “Ah
", my friend!” "
"she said, touchi"
ng his arm as sh
e had done her 
son’s when spe
aking to him tha
"t afternoon, “"
believe me I suf
fer no less tha
"n you do, but be"
 a man!”  �
"�But really, had"
n’t I better g
o away?” he as
"ked, looking kin"
dly at her over
 his spectacles.
"

“Ah, my de"
ar friend! Forge
t the wrongs tha
t may have been 
done you. Think
 that he is your
 father ... perh
aps in the agony
 of death.” Sh
e sighed. “I 
have loved you l
ike a son from t
he first. Trust 
"yourself to
me,"
 Pierre. I shall
 not forget your
 interests.” 
 Pierre did not
 understand a wo
"rd, but the conv"
iction that all 
this had to be 
"grew stronger, a"
nd he meekly fol
lowed Anna Mikh�
�ylovna who was 
 already opening
 a door.  This
 door led into a
 back anteroom. 
"An old man, a se"
rvant of the pr
"incesses, sat in"
 a corner knitti
ng a stocking. P
ierre had never 
been in this pa
rt of the house 
and did not even
 know of the exi
stence of these
 rooms. Anna Mik
"háylovna, addre"
ssing a maid who
 was hurrying pa
st with a decan
ter on a tray as
 “my dear” a
"nd “my sweet,�"
�� asked about 
the princess’ 
health and then 
led Pierre along
 a stone passage
. The first doo
r on the left le
d into the princ
esses’ apartme
nts. The maid w
ith the decanter
 in her haste ha
d not closed the
 door (everythin
g in the house 
was done in hast
"e at that time),"
 and Pierre and 
Anna Mikháylov
na in passing in
stinctively glan
ced into the roo
"m, where
Prince"
 Vasíli and the
 eldest princess
 were sitting cl
ose together ta
lking. Seeing th
"em pass, Prince "
Vasíli drew bac
k with obvious 
"impatience, whil"
e the princess j
umped up and wit
h a gesture of 
desperation slam
med the door wit
h all her might.
  This action 
was so unlike he
r usual composur
e and the fear d
epicted on Prin
ce Vasíli’s f
ace so out of ke
eping with his d
ignity that Pier
re stopped and 
glanced inquirin
gly over his spe
ctacles at his g
uide. Anna Mikh
áylovna evinced
" no surprise, sh"
e only smiled fa
intly and sighed
", as
if to say "
that this was no
 more than she h
ad expected.  
"“Be a man, my "
friend. I will l
ook after your i
"nterests,” sai"
d she in reply 
"to his look, and"
 went still fast
er along the pas
sage.  Pierre 
could not make o
ut what it was a
"ll about, and st"
ill less what �
��watching over 
his interests”
" meant, but he d"
ecided that all 
these things ha
d to be. From th
e passage they w
ent into a large
", dimly
lit roo"
m adjoining the 
count’s recept
ion room. It was
 one of those s
umptuous but col
d apartments kno
wn to Pierre onl
y from the front
"
approach, but "
even in this roo
m there now stoo
"d an empty bath,"
 and water had 
been spilled on 
the carpet. They
 were met by a d
eacon with a cen
ser and by a se
rvant who passed
 out on tiptoe w
ithout heeding t
hem. They went 
into the recepti
on room familiar
" to Pierre, with"
 two Italian wi
ndows opening in
to the conservat
"ory, with its la"
rge bust and ful
l length portra
it of Catherine 
the Great. The s
ame people were 
still sitting h
ere in almost th
e same positions
" as before, whis"
pering to one a
nother. All beca
me silent and tu
rned to look at 
the pale tear-wo
rn Anna Mikháy
lovna as she ent
"ered, and at the"
 big stout figur
"e of Pierre who,"
 hanging his he
"ad, meekly follo"
wed her.  Anna
 Mikháylovna’
s face expressed
 a consciousness
 that the decisi
ve moment had a
rrived. With the
 air of a practi
cal Petersburg l
"ady she now,
ke"
eping Pierre clo
"se beside her, e"
ntered the room 
even more boldly
 than that afte
rnoon. She felt 
that as she brou
ght with her the
 person the dyi
ng man wished to
" see, her own ad"
mission was assu
red. Casting a r
apid glance at 
all those in the
 room and notici
ng the count’s
 confessor ther
"e, she glided up"
 to him with a s
"ort of amble, no"
t exactly bowing
 yet seeming to
 grow suddenly s
"maller, and resp"
ectfully receive
d the blessing 
first of one and
 then of another
 priest.  “G
od be thanked th
at you are in ti
"me,” said she "
to one of the p
riests; “all w
e relatives have
 been in such an
xiety. This youn
g man is the co
"unt’s son,” "
she added more s
oftly. “What a
 terrible momen
t!”  Having 
said this she we
nt up to the doc
tor.  “Dear 
"doctor,” said "
"she, “this you"
ng man is the co
unt’s son. Is 
 there any hope?
”  The docto
r cast a rapid g
lance upwards an
d silently shrug
ged his shoulde
rs. Anna Mikháy
lovna with just 
the same movemen
t raised her sh
oulders and eyes
", almost closing"
" the latter, sig"
"hed, and moved a"
way from the do
ctor to Pierre. 
"To him, in a par"
ticularly respec
tful and tender
"ly sad voice, sh"
e said:  “Tr
ust in His mercy
!” and pointin
g out a small so
fa for him to si
t and wait for 
"her, she went si"
lently toward th
e door that ever
yone was watchi
ng and it creake
d very slightly 
as she disappear
ed behind it.  
"
Pierre, having "
made up his mind
 to obey his mon
itress implicitl
"y, moved
toward"
 the sofa she ha
d indicated. As 
soon as Anna Mik
háylovna had d
isappeared he no
ticed that the e
yes of all in th
e room turned to
 him with somet
hing more than c
uriosity and sym
pathy. He notice
d that they whi
spered to one an
"other, casting s"
ignificant looks
 at him with a k
ind of awe and 
even servility. 
A deference such
 as he had never
 before receive
d was shown him.
" A strange lady,"
 the one who had
 been talking to
"
the priests, r"
ose and offered 
him her seat; an
 aide-de-camp pi
cked up and ret
urned a glove Pi
erre had dropped
; the doctors be
came respectfull
y silent as he 
"passed by, and m"
oved to make way
 for him. At fir
st Pierre wishe
d to take anothe
r seat so as not
 to trouble the 
"lady, and also t"
o pick up the g
love himself and
 to pass round t
he doctors who w
ere not even in
 his way; but al
l at once he fel
t that this woul
"d not do, and
t"
hat tonight he w
as a person obli
ged to perform s
ome sort of awfu
l rite which ev
eryone expected 
"of him, and that"
 he was therefor
e bound to acce
pt their service
s. He took the g
love in silence 
from the aide-d
"e-camp, and sat "
down in the lady
"’s chair, plac"
ing his huge han
ds symmetricall
y on his knees i
n the naïve att
itude of an Egyp
"tian statue,
an"
d decided in his
 own mind that a
ll was as it sho
"uld be, and that"
 in order not t
o lose his head 
and do foolish t
hings he must no
t act on his ow
"n ideas tonight,"
 but must yield 
himself up entir
ely to the will 
of those who we
re guiding him. 
  Not two minut
es had passed be
fore Prince Vas�
�li with head er
ect majesticall
y entered the ro
om. He was weari
ng his long coat
 with three sta
rs on his breast
. He seemed to h
ave grown thinne
r since the morn
ing; his eyes s
eemed larger tha
n usual when he 
glanced round an
d noticed Pierr
e. He went up to
" him, took his h"
and (a thing he 
never used to do
"),
and drew it "
downwards as if 
wishing to ascer
tain whether it 
was firmly fixe
d on.  “Cour
"age, courage, my"
 friend! He has 
asked to see you
. That is well!
” and he turne
d to go.  But 
Pierre thought i
t necessary to a
sk: “How is...
” and hesitate
"d,
not knowing "
whether it would
 be proper to ca
ll the dying man
" “the
count,�"
�� yet ashamed t
o call him “fa
ther.”  “H
e had another st
roke about half 
an hour ago. Cou
"rage, my
friend"
...”  Pierre
’s mind was in
 such a confused
 state that the 
word “stroke�
� suggested to 
him a blow from 
something. He lo
oked at Prince V
asíli in perpl
"exity, and only "
later grasped th
at a stroke was 
an attack of il
lness. Prince Va
síli said somet
hing to Lorrain 
in passing and w
ent through the
 door on tiptoe.
 He could not wa
lk well on tipto
e and his whole
 body jerked at 
each step. The e
ldest princess f
"ollowed him, and"
 the priests an
d deacons and so
me servants also
 went in at the 
door. Through t
hat door was hea
rd a noise of th
ings being moved
" about, and
at "
last Anna Mikhá
"ylovna, still wi"
th the same expr
"ession, pale but"
 resolute in th
e discharge of d
"uty, ran out and"
 touching Pierre
 lightly on the
 arm said:  �
�The divine merc
y is inexhaustib
le! Unction is a
bout to be admi
nistered. Come.�
��  Pierre wen
t in at the door
", stepping on th"
"e soft carpet, a"
nd noticed that
 the strange lad
"y, the aide-de-c"
"amp, and some of"
" the servants, a"
ll followed him
" in, as if there"
 were now no fur
ther need for pe
rmission to ent
er that room.  
     CHAPTER
 XXIII  Pierre
 well knew this 
large room divid
ed by columns an
"d an arch, its
"
walls hung round
 with Persian ca
rpets. The part 
of the room behi
"nd the
columns,"
 with a high sil
k-curtained maho
gany bedstead on
 one side and o
n the other an i
mmense case cont
"aining icons, wa"
s brightly illum
inated with red
 light like a Ru
ssian church dur
ing evening serv
ice. Under the 
gleaming icons s
tood a long inva
"lid chair, and i"
n that chair on
 snowy-white smo
"oth pillows, evi"
dently freshly c
"hanged, Pierre
"
saw—covered to
 the waist by a 
bright green qui
lt—the familia
"r,
majestic fig"
ure of his fathe
"r, Count Bezúkh"
"ov, with that gr"
ay mane of hair
 above his broad
 forehead which 
reminded one of 
"a lion, and the "
deep characteri
stically noble w
rinkles of his h
"andsome, ruddy f"
ace. He lay jus
t under the icon
s; his large thi
ck hands outside
 the quilt. Into
 the right hand
", which was lyin"
g palm downwards
", a wax taper ha"
d been thrust b
etween forefinge
"r and thumb, and"
" an old servant,"
 bending over fr
om behind the c
"hair, held it in"
 position. By th
e chair stood th
"e priests,
thei"
r long hair fall
ing over their m
agnificent glitt
"ering vestments,"
 with lighted t
apers in their h
"ands, slowly and"
 solemnly conduc
ting the servic
e. A little behi
nd them stood th
e two younger pr
incesses holding
 handkerchiefs 
"to their eyes, a"
nd just in front
 of them their e
"ldest
sister, C"
"atiche, with a v"
icious and deter
mined look stead
ily fixed on th
"e icons, as thou"
gh declaring to 
all that she cou
ld not answer fo
r herself shoul
d she glance rou
nd. Anna Mikháy
"lovna, with a me"
"ek,
sorrowful, "
and all-forgivin
g expression on 
"her face, stood "
by the door nea
r the strange la
dy. Prince Vasí
li in front of t
"he door, near th"
e invalid chair
", a wax taper in"
" his left hand, "
was leaning his 
left arm on the
 carved back of 
a velvet chair h
e had turned rou
nd for the purpo
"se,
and was cro"
ssing himself wi
th his right han
"d, turning his e"
yes upward each
 time he touched
 his forehead. H
is face wore a c
alm look of piet
y and resignati
on to the will o
f God. “If you
 do not understa
nd these sentim
"ents,” he seem"
"ed to be saying,"
 “so much the 
worse for you!�
�  Behind him 
stood the aide-d
"e-camp, the doct"
"ors, and the men"
servants; the m
en and women had
 separated as in
 church. All wer
e silently cross
"ing
themselves,"
 and the reading
 of the church s
"ervice, the subd"
ued chanting of
 deep bass voice
"s, and in the in"
tervals sighs an
d the shuffling 
of feet were th
e only sounds th
at could be hear
d. Anna Mikháyl
"ovna, with
an a"
ir of importance
 that showed tha
t she felt she q
uite knew what s
"he
was about, w"
ent across the r
oom to where Pie
rre was standing
 and gave him a
 taper. He lit i
"t and, distracte"
d by observing t
"hose around him,"
 began crossing
 himself with th
e hand that held
 the taper.  S
"ophie, the rosy,"
 laughter-loving
", youngest princ"
ess with the mol
"e,
watched him."
" She smiled, hid"
 her face in her
" handkerchief, a"
nd remained wit
h it hidden for 
awhile; then loo
king up and seei
ng Pierre she a
gain began to la
ugh. She evident
ly felt unable t
o look at him w
"ithout laughing,"
 but could not r
esist looking at
 him: so to be o
ut of temptatio
n she slipped qu
ietly behind one
 of the columns.
 In the midst o
f the service th
e voices of the 
priests suddenly
" ceased, they wh"
ispered to one 
"another, and the"
 old servant who
 was holding the
 count’s hand 
 got up and said
 something to th
e ladies. Anna M
ikháylovna step
ped forward and
", stooping over "
"the dying man, b"
eckoned to Lorra
in from behind 
her back. The Fr
ench doctor held
 no taper; he wa
s leaning again
st one of the co
lumns in a respe
ctful attitude i
"mplying that he,"
"
a foreigner, i"
n spite of all d
ifferences of fa
"ith, understood "
the full import
ance of the rite
 now being perfo
rmed and even ap
proved of it. He
 now approached
 the sick man wi
th the noiseless
 step of one in 
full vigor of l
"ife, with his de"
licate white fin
gers raised from
 the green quilt
 the hand that 
"was free, and tu"
rning sideways f
elt the pulse an
d reflected a m
oment. The sick 
man was given so
mething to drink
", there was a
s"
"tir around him, "
then the people 
resumed their pl
aces and the ser
vice continued.
 During this int
erval Pierre not
iced that Prince
 Vasíli left t
he chair on whic
h he had been le
"aning, and—wit"
h an air which 
intimated that h
e knew what he w
as about and if 
others did not 
understand him i
t was so much th
e worse for them
—did not go up
 to the dying m
"an, but passed b"
"y him, joined th"
e eldest princes
"s, and moved
wi"
th her to the si
de of the room w
here stood the h
igh bedstead wit
h its silken ha
ngings. On leavi
ng the bed both 
Prince Vasíli a
nd the princess 
 passed out by a
" back door, but "
returned to thei
r places one aft
er the other be
fore the service
 was concluded. 
Pierre paid no m
ore attention t
o this occurrenc
e than to the re
st of what went 
"on, having made "
up his mind onc
e for all that w
hat he saw happe
ning around him 
that evening was
 in some way es
sential.  The 
chanting of the 
"service ceased, "
and the voice of
 the priest was 
 heard respectfu
lly congratulati
ng the dying man
 on having recei
ved the sacrame
nt. The dying ma
n lay as lifeles
s and immovable 
as before. Aroun
d him everyone 
began to stir: s
teps were audibl
"e and whispers, "
among which Ann
a Mikháylovna�
�s was the most 
distinct.  Pie
rre heard her sa
y:  “Certain
ly he must be mo
ved onto the bed
; here it will b
e impossible...
”  The sick 
man was so surro
unded by doctors
", princesses, an"
d servants that
 Pierre could no
 longer see the 
reddish-yellow f
ace with its gra
"y
mane—which,"
 though he saw o
ther faces as we
"ll, he had not l"
ost sight of fo
r a single momen
t during the who
le service. He j
udged by the ca
utious movements
 of those who cr
owded round the 
invalid chair th
at they had lif
ted the dying ma
n and were movin
g him.  “Cat
ch hold of my ar
m or you’ll dr
op him!” he he
ard one of the 
servants say in 
a frightened whi
sper. “Catch h
old from underne
ath. Here!” e
xclaimed differe
nt voices; and t
he heavy breathi
ng of the beare
rs and the shuff
ling of their fe
et grew more hur
"ried, as if the"
 weight they wer
e carrying were 
too much for the
m.  As the bea
"rers, among whom"
 was Anna Mikhá
"ylovna, passed t"
he young man he
 caught a moment
ary glimpse betw
een their heads 
and backs of the
 dying man’s 
"high, stout, unc"
overed chest and
 powerful should
"ers, raised by
"
those who were h
olding him under
" the armpits, an"
"d of his gray, c"
"urly,
leonine h"
"ead. This head, "
with its remarka
bly broad brow a
"nd cheekbones,
"
"its handsome, se"
"nsual mouth, and"
" its cold, majes"
"tic expression, "
was not disfigu
red by the appro
ach of death. It
 was the same as
 Pierre remembe
red it three mon
"ths before, when"
 the count had s
ent him to Pete
rsburg. But now 
this head was sw
aying helplessly
 with the uneven
 movements of t
"he bearers, and "
the cold listles
s gaze fixed its
elf upon nothin
g.  After a fe
w minutes’ bus
tle beside the h
"igh bedstead, th"
ose who had car
ried the sick ma
n dispersed. Ann
a Mikháylovna t
ouched Pierre’
s hand and said
", “Come.” Pi"
erre went with h
er to the bed on
 which the sick
 man had been la
id in a stately 
pose in keeping 
with the ceremon
y just complete
d. He lay with h
is head propped 
high on the pill
ows. His hands 
were symmetrical
ly placed on the
 green silk quil
"t, the palms
do"
wnward. When Pie
rre came up the 
count was gazing
 straight at him
", but
with a lo"
ok the significa
nce of which cou
ld not be unders
tood by mortal 
man. Either this
 look meant noth
ing but that as 
long as one has 
eyes they must 
"look somewhere, "
or it meant too 
much. Pierre hes
"itated,
not kno"
"wing what to do,"
 and glanced inq
uiringly at his 
guide. Anna Mik
háylovna made a
 hurried sign wi
"th her eyes, gla"
ncing at the sic
k man’s hand 
and moving her l
ips as if to sen
d it a kiss. Pie
"rre,
carefully "
stretching his n
eck so as not to
 touch the quilt
", followed her
"
suggestion and p
ressed his lips 
to the large bon
"ed, fleshy hand."
 Neither the ha
nd nor a single 
muscle of the co
unt’s face sti
rred. Once more 
 Pierre looked q
uestioningly at 
Anna Mikháylovn
a to see what he
 was to do next
. Anna Mikháylo
vna with her eye
s indicated a ch
air that stood 
beside the bed. 
Pierre obedientl
"y sat down, his "
eyes asking if h
e were doing ri
ght. Anna Mikhá
ylovna nodded ap
provingly. Again
 Pierre fell in
to the naïvely 
symmetrical pose
 of an Egyptian 
"statue, evidentl"
y distressed th
at his stout and
 clumsy body too
k up so much roo
m and doing his
 utmost to look 
as small as poss
ible. He looked 
"at the count, wh"
o still gazed a
t the spot where
 Pierre’s face
 had been before
 he sat down. A
nna Mikháylovna
 indicated by he
r attitude her c
onsciousness of 
 the pathetic im
portance of thes
e last moments o
f meeting betwee
n the father an
d son. This last
ed about two min
"utes, which to P"
ierre seemed an 
 hour. Suddenly 
the broad muscle
s and lines of t
he count’s fac
e began to twit
ch. The twitchin
"g increased, the"
 handsome mouth 
was drawn to one
 side (only now
 did Pierre real
ize how near dea
th his father wa
"s), and
from th"
at distorted mou
th issued an ind
"istinct, hoarse "
sound. Anna Mik
háylovna looked
 attentively at 
the sick man’s
" eyes, trying to"
 guess what he 
wanted; she poin
ted first to Pie
"rre, then to som"
"e drink,
then n"
amed Prince Vas�
�li in an inquir
"ing whisper, the"
n pointed to the
 quilt. The eye
s and face of th
e sick man showe
d impatience. He
 made an effort
 to look at the 
servant who stoo
d constantly at 
the head of the 
 bed.  “Want
s to turn on the
" other side,” "
whispered the se
"rvant, and got u"
p to turn the c
ount’s heavy b
ody toward the w
all.  Pierre r
ose to help him.
  While the co
unt was being tu
"rned over, one o"
f his arms fell 
back helplessly
 and he made a f
ruitless effort 
to pull it forwa
rd. Whether he 
noticed the look
 of terror with 
which Pierre reg
arded that lifel
"ess arm,
or whe"
ther some other 
thought flitted 
across his dying
" brain, at any
"
rate he glanced 
at the refractor
"y arm, at Pierre"
’s terror-stri
"cken
face, and "
again at the arm
", and on his fac"
"e a feeble, pite"
ous smile appea
"red, quite out o"
f keeping with h
"is features, tha"
t seemed to deri
de his own help
lessness. At sig
ht of this smile
 Pierre felt an 
unexpected quiv
ering in his bre
ast and a tickli
"ng in his nose, "
and tears dimmed
 his eyes. The 
sick man was tur
ned on to his si
de with his face
 to the wall. H
e sighed.  “
"He is dozing,”"
 said Anna Mikh�
"�ylovna, observi"
ng that one of t
he princesses w
as coming to tak
e her turn at wa
tching. “Let u
s go.”  Pier
re went out.  
    CHAPTER 
XXIV  There wa
s now no one in 
the reception ro
om except Prince
 Vasíli and the
 eldest princes
"s, who were sitt"
ing under the po
rtrait of Cather
ine the Great a
nd talking eager
ly. As soon as t
hey saw Pierre a
nd his companion
 they became si
"lent, and Pierre"
 thought he saw 
the princess hid
e something as 
she whispered: 
 “I can’t b
ear the sight of
 that woman.” 
  “Catiche ha
s had tea served
 in the small dr
"awing room,” s"
aid Prince Vas�
�li to Anna Mikh
áylovna. “Go 
and take somethi
"ng, my poor Anna"
"
Mikháylovna, "
or you will not 
hold out.”  
To Pierre he sai
"d nothing, merel"
y giving his arm
 a sympathetic s

and in the middl

a motley throng 
of people sat th
"ere, not merryma"
"king, but somber"
"ly
whispering, "
and betraying by
 every word and 
movement that th
ey none of them
 forgot what was
 happening and w
hat was about to
 happen in the 
bedroom. Pierre 
did not eat anyt
hing though he w
ould very much h
ave liked to. H
e looked inquiri
ngly at his moni
tress and saw th
at she was agai
n going on tipto
e to the recepti
on room where th
ey had left Prin
ce Vasíli and 
the eldest princ
ess. Pierre conc
luded that this 
also was essent
"ial, and after a"
 short interval 
followed her. An
na Mikháylovna 
 was standing be
side the princes
"s, and they were"
 both speaking i
n excited whisp

to know what is

e younger of the
" two speakers, e"
vidently in the

 Anna Mikháylov

 Prince Vasíli 
was seated in an
 easy chair in h
is familiar atti
"tude,
with one "
leg crossed high
 above the other
". His cheeks, wh"
ich were so fla
bby that they lo
oked heavier bel
"ow, were twitchi"
ng violently; bu
t he wore the a
ir of a man litt
le concerned in 
what the two lad

".

“Come, my"

leases. You kno
w how fond the c

��  “I don�

younger of the 
"two ladies, addr"
essing Prince Va

ng to an inlaid

eld in her hand.
 “All I know i
s that his real

e tried to pass 
Anna Mikháylovn
"a, but the latte"

"

“I know, m"

ot let go easily
. “Dear princ
"ess, I beg and i"
"mplore you, have"
 some pity on hi

The princess did
 not reply. Thei
r efforts in the
 struggle for th
e portfolio wer
e the only sound
"s audible, but i"
t was evident th
at if the princ
"ess did speak, h"
er words would n
ot be flattering
 to Anna Mikhá

he latter held o
"n tenaciously, h"
er voice lost no
ne of its honey
ed firmness and 
softness.  “
"Pierre, my dear,"
 come here. I th
ink he will not 
be out of place 
in a family con
sultation; is it
" not so, Prince?"
”  “Why do
"n’t you speak,"
 cousin?” sudd
enly shrieked th
e princess so l
oud that those i
n the drawing ro
om heard her and
 were startled. 
“Why do you r
emain silent whe
n heaven knows w
ho permits herse

 on the very thr
eshold of a dyin
g man’s room? 
 Intriguer!” s
he hissed viciou
"sly, and tugged "
with all her mig

a Mikháylovna w
ent forward a st
ep or two to kee
p her hold on th

d changed her gr

th reproach and 
"surprise,
“th"
is is absurd! Co
"me, let go I tel"

 princess let go
.  “And you 
too!”  But A

 did not obey hi

“Let go,"
 I tell you! I w
ill take the res
ponsibility. I m
yself will go a

. does that sati

"��But, Prince,�"

er such a solemn

ow him a moment�
"��s peace! Here,"
" Pierre, tell th"
em your opinion
",” said she, t"
urning to the yo
"ung man who, hav"
ing come quite 
"close, was gazin"
g with astonishm
ent at the angry
 face of the pri
ncess which had
 lost all dignit
"y, and at the tw"
itching cheeks o
f Prince Vasíl
i.  “Remembe
r that you will 
answer for the c

said Prince Vas
íli severely. �
��You don’t kn
ow what you are 
doing.”  “
Vile woman!” s
houted the princ
"ess, darting une"
xpectedly at Ann
a Mikháylovna 
and snatching th
e portfolio from
 her.  Prince 
Vasíli bent his
 head and spread
 out his hands. 
  At this momen
t that terrible 
"door, which Pier"
re had watched s
o long and whic
h had always ope
"ned so quietly, "
burst noisily op
en and banged a
"gainst the wall,"
 and the second 
of the three sis
ters rushed out 
 wringing her ha
nds.  “What 
are you doing!�
� she cried vehe
mently. “He is
 dying and you 
leave me alone w
ith him!”  H
er sister droppe
d the portfolio.
 Anna Mikháylov
"na, stooping, qu"
ickly caught up
 the object of c
ontention and ra
n into the bedro
om. The eldest 
princess and Pri
"nce Vasíli, rec"
overing themselv
"es, followed her"
. A few minutes
 later the eldes
t sister came ou
t with a pale ha
"rd face, again
"
biting her under
lip. At sight of
 Pierre her expr
ession showed an
 irrepressible 
hatred.  “Ye
"s, now you may b"
e glad!” said 
she; “this is 
what you have b
een waiting for.
” And bursting
 into tears she 
hid her face in 
her handkerchie
f and rushed fro
m the room.  P
rince Vasíli ca
me next. He stag
gered to the sof
a on which Pierr
e was sitting a
nd dropped onto 
"it, covering his"
 face with his h
and. Pierre not
iced that he was
 pale and that h
is jaw quivered 
and shook as if 
in an ague.  
"“Ah, my friend"
"!” said he, ta"
king Pierre by t
he elbow; and th
ere was in his 
voice a sincerit
y and weakness P
ierre had never 
observed in it 
before. “How o
"ften we sin, how"
 much we deceive
", and all for wh"
at? I am near s
"ixty, dear frien"
d... I too... Al
l will end in de
"ath, all! Death "
is awful...” 
and he burst int
o tears.  Anna
 Mikháylovna ca
me out last. She
 approached Pier
"re with slow, qu"
iet steps.  �
��Pierre!” she
 said.  Pierre
 gave her an inq
uiring look. She
 kissed the youn
g man on his fo
"rehead, wetting "
him with her tea
rs. Then after a
 pause she said:
  “He is no 
more....”  P
ierre looked at 
her over his spe
ctacles.  “C
"ome, I will go w"
ith you. Try to 
"weep, nothing gi"
ves such relief 
as tears.”  
 She led him int
o the dark drawi
ng room and Pier
re was glad no o
ne could see hi
s face. Anna Mik
háylovna left h
"im, and when she"
 returned he was
 fast asleep wi
th his head on h
is arm.  In th
e morning Anna M
ikháylovna said
 to Pierre:  �
"��Yes, my dear, "
this is a great 
"loss for us all,"
 not to speak of
 you. But God w
ill support you:
" you are young, "
"and are now, I h"
"ope, in command"
 of an immense f
ortune. The will
 has not yet bee
n opened. I know
 you well enoug
h to be sure tha
t this will not 
"turn your head, "
but it imposes 
"duties on you, a"
nd you must be a
 man.”  Pier
re was silent. 
 “Perhaps lat
er on I may tell
" you, my dear bo"
"y, that if I had"
 not been there
", God only knows"
 what would have
 happened! You k
"now, Uncle promi"
sed me only the
 day before yest
erday not to for
get Borís. But 
he had no time.
" I hope, my dear"
" friend, you wil"
l carry out your
 father’s wis
h?”  Pierre 
understood nothi
ng of all this a
nd coloring shyl
y looked in sil
ence at Princess
 Anna Mikháylov
na. After her ta
"lk with Pierre, "
Anna Mikháylov
na returned to t
he Rostóvs’ a
nd went to bed. 
On waking in th
e morning she to
ld the Rostóvs 
and all her acqu
aintances the de
tails of Count 
Bezúkhov’s de
ath. She said th
e count had died
 as she would h
erself wish to d
"ie, that his end"
 was not only to
uching but edify
ing. As to the 
last meeting bet
ween father and 
"son, it was so t"
ouching that she
 could not thin
k of it without 
"tears, and did n"
ot know which ha
d behaved bette
r during those a
wful moments—t
he father who so
 remembered eve
rything and ever
ybody at last an
d had spoken suc
h pathetic words
" to
the son, or"
" Pierre, whom it"
 had been pitifu
"l to see, so str"
icken was he wi
"th grief, though"
 he tried hard t
o hide it in ord
er not to sadden
 his dying fath
er. “It is pai
"nful, but it doe"
s one good. It u
plifts the soul
 to see such men
 as the old coun
t and his worthy
" son,” said sh"
e. Of the behav
ior of the eldes

"ovingly, but in "
whispers and as 
a great secret. 
      CHAPT
ER XXV  At Bal
"d Hills, Prince "
Nicholas Andrée
vich Bolkónski�
"��s estate, the"
 arrival of youn
g Prince Andrew 
and his wife was
" daily expected,"
 but this expec
tation did not u
pset the regular
 routine of life
 in the old pri
nce’s househol
d. General in Ch
ief Prince Nicho
las Andréevich 
 (nicknamed in s
"ociety, “the K"
ing of Prussia�
�) ever since th
e Emperor Paul 
had exiled him t
o his country es
tate had lived t
here continuousl
y with his daug
"hter, Princess M"
"ary, and her com"
"panion, Mademois"
elle Bourienne.
 Though in the n
ew reign he was 
free to return t
"o the
capitals,"
 he still contin
ued to live in t
"he country, rema"
rking that anyo
ne who wanted to
 see him could c
ome the hundred 
miles from Mosco
w to Bald Hills
", while he himse"
lf needed no one
 and nothing. He
 used to say th
at there are onl
y two sources of
 human vice—id
leness and supe
"rstition, and on"
ly two virtues�
�activity and in
telligence. He 
himself undertoo
k his daughter�
"�s education, an"
d to develop the
se two cardinal
 virtues in her 
gave her lessons
 in algebra and 
geometry till s
"he was twenty, a"
nd arranged her 
life so that her
 whole time was 
 occupied. He wa
s himself always
 occupied: writi
"ng his memoirs, "
solving problem
s in higher math
"ematics, turning"
 snuffboxes on a
" lathe, working"
"
in the garden, "
or superintendin
g the building t
hat was always g
oing on at his 
estate. As regul
arity is a prime
 condition facil
itating activity
",
regularity in"
 his household w
as carried to th
e highest point 
of exactitude. 
He always came t
o table under pr
ecisely the same
" conditions,
an"
d not only at th
e same hour but 
at the same minu
te. With those a
"bout
him, from "
his daughter to 
"his serfs, the p"
rince was sharp 
and invariably 
"exacting, so tha"
t without being 
a hardhearted ma
n he inspired su
ch fear and res
pect as few hard
hearted men woul
d have aroused. 
Although he was 
 in retirement a
nd had now no in
fluence in polit
"ical affairs, ev"
ery high offici
al appointed to 
the province in 
which the prince
’s estate lay 
 considered it h
is duty to visit
 him and waited 
in the lofty ant
echamber just a
"s the architect,"
" gardener, or Pr"
"incess Mary did,"
 till the prince
 appeared punct
ually to the app
ointed hour. Eve
ryone sitting in
 this antechamb
er experienced t
he same feeling 
of respect and e
ven fear when t
he enormously hi
gh study door op
ened and showed 
the figure of a 
rather small ol
"d man, with powd"
"ered wig, small "
"withered hands, "
and bushy gray 
"eyebrows which, "
"when he frowned,"
 sometimes hid t
he gleam of his 
"shrewd,
youthfu"
lly glittering e
yes.  On the m
orning of the da
y that the young
 couple were to 
"arrive, Princess"
 Mary entered t
he antechamber a
s usual at the t
ime appointed fo
r the morning g
"reeting, crossin"
g herself with t
repidation and r
epeating a sile
nt prayer. Every
 morning she cam
"e in like that, "
and every mornin
g prayed that t
he daily intervi
ew might pass of
f well.  An ol
d powdered manse
rvant who was si
tting in the ant
echamber rose q
uietly and said 
in a whisper: �
�Please walk in.
”  Through t
he door came the
 regular hum of 
a lathe. The pri
ncess timidly o
pened the door w
hich moved noise
lessly and easil
y. She paused at
 the entrance. 
The prince was w
orking at the la
the and after gl
ancing round co
ntinued his work
.  The enormou
s study was full
 of things evide
ntly in constant
 use. The large
 table covered w
ith books and pl
"ans, the tall gl"
ass-fronted boo
kcases with keys
" in the locks, t"
he high desk for
 writing while 
"standing up, on "
which lay an ope
"n exercise book,"
 and the lathe w
ith tools laid 
ready to hand an
d shavings scatt
ered around—al
l indicated con
"tinuous, varied,"
 and orderly act
ivity. The motio
n of the small f
oot shod in a T
artar boot embro
idered with silv
"er, and the firm"
 pressure of th
e lean sinewy ha
"nd, showed that "
the prince still
 possessed the 
tenacious endura
nce and vigor of
 hardy old age. 
After a few more
 turns of the l
athe he removed 
his foot from th
"e pedal, wiped h"
"is chisel,
drop"
ped it into a le
ather pouch atta
ched to the lath
"e, and, approach"
"ing
the table, "
summoned his dau
ghter. He never 
gave his childre
"n a blessing,
s"
o he simply held
 out his bristly
 cheek (as yet u
"nshaven) and, re"
garding her ten
derly and attent
"ively, said seve"
rely:  “Quit
e well? All righ
"t then, sit down"
.” He took the
 exercise book 
containing lesso
ns in geometry w
ritten by himsel
f and drew up a 
chair with his 
foot.  “For 
tomorrow!” sai
"d he, quickly fi"
nding the page a
nd making a scr
atch from one pa
ragraph to anoth
er with his hard
 nail.  The pr
incess bent over
 the exercise bo
ok on the table.
  “Wait a bi
"t, here’s a le"
"tter for you,”"
 said the old ma
"n suddenly,
tak"
ing a letter add
ressed in a woma
n’s hand from 
a bag hanging ab
"ove
the table, "
onto which he th
rew it.  At th
e sight of the l
etter red patche
s showed themsel
ves on the prin
cess’ face. Sh
e took it quickl
y and bent her h
ead over it.  
“From Héloïs
e?” asked the 
prince with a co
ld smile that sh
owed his still 
"sound, yellowish"
 teeth.  “Ye
"s, it’s from J"
"ulie,” replied"
 the princess wi
th a timid glanc
e and a timid s
mile.  “I’
ll let two more 
"letters pass, bu"
t the third I’
"ll read,” said"
 the prince ste
rnly; “I’m a
fraid you write 
much nonsense. I
’ll read the 
third!”  “
Read this if you
" like, Father,�"
� said the princ
"ess, blushing st"
ill more and ho
lding out the le
tter.  “The 
"third, I said th"
e third!” crie
d the prince abr
"uptly, pushing
"
"the letter away,"
 and leaning his
 elbows on the t
able he drew tow
ard him the exe
rcise book conta
ining geometrica
l figures.  �
"�Well, madam,”"
" he began, stoop"
ing over the boo
k close to his 
daughter and pla
cing an arm on t
he back of the c
hair on which sh
"e sat,
so that "
she felt herself
 surrounded on a
ll sides by the 
acrid scent of 
old age and toba
"cco, which she h"
ad known so long
". “Now, madam,"
 these triangle
s are equal; ple
ase note that th
e angle ABC...�
�  The princes
s looked in a sc
ared way at her 
father’s eyes 
glittering clos
e to her; the re
d patches on her
 face came and w
"ent, and it was"
 plain that she 
understood nothi
ng and was so fr
ightened that he
r fear would pr
event her unders
tanding any of h
er father’s fu
rther explanati
"ons, however cle"
ar they might be
. Whether it was
 the teacher’
s fault or the p
"upil’s, this s"
ame thing happen
ed every day: t
he princess’ e
"yes grew dim, sh"
e could not see 
and could not he
"ar
anything, bu"
t was only consc
ious of her ster
n father’s wit
hered face clos
"e to her, of his"
 breath and the 
"smell of him, an"
d could think on
ly of how to ge
t away quickly t
o her own room t
o make out the p
roblem in peace
. The old man wa
s beside himself
: moved the chai
r on which he wa
s sitting noisi
ly backward and 
"forward, made ef"
forts to control
 himself and no
t become vehemen
"t, but almost al"
ways did become 
"vehement, scolde"
"d,
and sometime"
s flung the exer
cise book away. 
  The princess 
gave a wrong ans
wer.  “Well 
"now, isn’t she"
 a fool!” shou
"ted the prince, "
pushing the book
 aside and turn
ing sharply away
; but rising imm
"ediately, he pac"
"ed up and
down,"
 lightly touched
 his daughter’
s hair and sat d
own again.  He
 drew up his cha
"ir, and continue"
d to explain.  
 “This won’t
" do, Princess; i"
"t won’t do,”"
" said he, when P"
"rincess
Mary, h"
aving taken and 
closed the exerc
ise book with th
e next day’s 
"lesson, was abou"
t to leave: “M
athematics are m
"ost important, m"
adam! I don’t
 want to have yo
u like our silly
 ladies. Get use
d to it and you
"’ll like it,�"
� and he patted 
her cheek. “It
 will drive all 
the nonsense ou
t of your head.�
��  She turned
" to go, but he s"
topped her with 
a gesture and to
ok an uncut boo
k from the high 
desk.  “Here
 is some sort of
 Key to the Myst
eries that your 
Héloïse has s
ent you. Religio
us! I don’t in
terfere with any
one’s belief..
. I have looked
 at it. Take it.
" Well, now go. G"
o.”  He patt
ed her on the sh
oulder and himse
lf closed the do
or after her.  
 Princess Mary w
ent back to her 
room with the sa
"d, scared expres"
sion that rarel
y left her and w
hich made her pl
"ain, sickly face"
 yet plainer. Sh
e sat down at h
er writing table
", on which stood"
 miniature portr
aits and which 
was littered wit
h books and pape
rs. The princess
 was as untidy a
s her father wa
s tidy. She put 
down the geometr
y book and eager
ly broke the se
al of her letter
. It was from he
r most intimate 
friend from chi
ldhood; that sam
e Julie Karágin
a who had been a
t the Rostóvs�
� name-day part
y.  Julie wrot
e in French:  
Dear and preciou
"s Friend, How te"
rrible and frigh
tful a thing is 
 separation! Tho
ugh I tell mysel
f that half my l
ife and half my 
happiness are w
rapped up in you
", and that in sp"
ite of the dista
nce separating u
s our hearts ar
e united by indi
"ssoluble bonds, "
my heart rebels 
against fate an
d in spite of th
e pleasures and 
distractions aro
und me I cannot 
 overcome a cert
ain secret sorro
w that has been 
in my heart ever
 since we parte
d. Why are we no
t together as we
 were last summe
"r, in your big
"
"study, on the bl"
"ue sofa, the con"
fidential sofa? 
Why cannot I now
", as
three mont"
"hs ago, draw fre"
sh moral strengt
h from your look
", so gentle,
ca"
"lm, and penetrat"
"ing, a look I lo"
ved so well and 
seem to see befo
re me as I writ
e?  Having rea
"d thus far, Prin"
cess Mary sighed
 and glanced int
o the mirror wh
ich stood on her
 right. It refle
"cted a weak, ung"
raceful figure a
nd thin face. H
"er eyes, always "
"sad, now looked "
with particular 
hopelessness at
 her reflection 
in the glass. �
�She flatters me
",” thought the"
"
princess, turn"
ing away and con
tinuing to read.
 But Julie did n
ot flatter her 
"friend, the prin"
cess’ eyes—l
"arge, deep and l"
uminous (it seem
ed as if at tim
es there radiate
d from them shaf
ts of warm light
)—were so bea
utiful that very
 often in spite 
of the plainness
 of her face th
ey gave her an a
ttraction more p
owerful than tha
t of beauty. But
 the princess n
ever saw the bea
utiful expressio
n of her own eye
s—the look th
ey had when she 
was not thinking
 of herself. As 
"with everyone, h"
er face assumed

ading:  All Mo

thing but war. O
ne of my two bro
thers is already
"
abroad, the ot"
her is with the 
"Guards, who are "
starting on thei
r march to the 
frontier. Our de
ar Emperor has l
eft Petersburg a
nd it is thought
 intends to exp
ose his precious
 person to the c
hances of war. G
od grant that t
he Corsican mons
ter who is destr
oying the peace 
of Europe may b
e overthrown by 
the angel whom i
t has pleased th
"e Almighty, in H"
"is
goodness, to"
 give us as sove
reign! To say no
thing of my brot
"hers, this
war "
has deprived me 
of one of the as
sociations neare
st my heart. I m
ean young Nicho
"las Rostóv, who"
 with his enthus
iasm could not b
ear to remain i
nactive and has 
left the univers

army. I will con
"fess to
you, de"
"ar Mary, that in"
 spite of his ex
treme youth his 
departure for t
he army was a gr
eat grief to me.
" This young man,"
 of whom I spoke
 to you last su
"mmer, is so nobl"
e-minded and ful
l of that real y
outhfulness whic
h one seldom fi
nds nowadays amo
ng our old men o
"f twenty and, pa"
"rticularly,
he "
is so frank and 
has so much hear
t. He is so pure
 and poetic that
 my relations w
"ith him, transie"
"nt as they were,"
 have been one o
f the sweetest 
comforts to my p
"oor heart, which"
 has already suf
fered so much. 
Someday I will t
ell you about ou
r parting and al
l that was said 
then. That is s
till too fresh. 
"Ah, dear friend,"
 you are happy n
ot to know thes
e poignant joys 
and sorrows. You
" are fortunate, "
for the latter a
re generally th
e stronger! I kn
ow very well tha
t Count Nicholas
 is too young e
ver to be more t
o me than a frie
"nd, but this swe"
"et friendship,
"
this poetic and 
"pure intimacy, w"
ere what my hear
t needed. But en
ough of this! T
"he chief news, a"
bout which all M
"oscow gossips, i"
s the death of 
old Count Bezúk
"hov, and his inh"
eritance. Fancy!
 The three princ
esses have rece
ived very little
", Prince Vasíli"
" nothing, and it"
 is Monsieur Pi
erre who has inh
erited all the p
roperty and has 
besides been re
cognized as legi
timate; so that 
he is now Count 
Bezúkhov and p
ossessor of the 
finest fortune i
n Russia. It is 
rumored that Pri
nce Vasíli pla
yed a very despi
cable part in th
is affair and th
at he returned 
to Petersburg qu
ite crestfallen.
  I confess I 
understand very 
little about all
 these matters o
f wills and inh
eritance; but I 
do know that sin
ce this young ma
"n, whom we all u"
sed to know as 
plain Monsieur P
"ierre, has becom"
e Count Bezúkho
v and the owner
 of one of the l
argest fortunes 
"in Russia, I am "
much amused to 
watch the change
 in the tone and
 manners of the 
mammas burdened 
by marriageable
" daughters, and "
of the young lad
"ies themselves, "
"toward
him, tho"
"ugh, between you"
" and me, he alwa"
ys seemed to me 
a poor sort of 
fellow. As for t
he past two year
s people have am
used themselves 
 by finding husb
ands for me (mos
t of whom I don�
"��t even know), "
the matchmaking
 chronicles of M
oscow now speak 
of me as the fut
ure Countess Be
zúkhova. But yo
u will understan
d that I have no
 desire for the 
post. À propos
 of marriages: d
o you know that 
a while ago that
 universal aunt
ie Anna Mikháyl
"ovna told me, un"
der the seal of 
"strict secrecy, "
of a plan of ma
rriage for you. 
It is neither mo
re nor less than
 with Prince Va
síli’s son An
"atole, whom they"
 wish to reform 
by marrying him 
to someone rich
 and distinguée
", and it is on y"
ou that his rela
tions’ choice
 has fallen. I d
on’t know what
 you will think 
"of it, but
I co"
nsider it my dut
y to let you kno
w of it. He is s
aid to be very 
handsome and a t
errible scapegra
ce. That is all 
I have been able
 to find out ab
out him.  But 
enough of gossip
. I am at the en
d of my second s
"heet of paper, a"
nd Mamma has se
nt for me to go 
and dine at the 
Apráksins’. R
ead the mystica

an enormous succ

 there are thin
gs in it difficu
lt for the feebl
e human mind to 
"grasp, it
is an"
 admirable book 
which calms and 
elevates the sou

my respects to m

  JULIE  P.S.
 Let me have new
s of your brothe
r and his charmi
ng little wife. 
  The princess 
pondered awhile 
with a thoughtfu
l smile and her 
luminous eyes l
it up so that he
r face was entir
ely transformed.
 Then she sudden
ly rose and wit
h her heavy trea
d went up to the
 table. She took
 a sheet of pap
er and her hand 
moved rapidly ov
er it. This is t
he reply she wro
"te,
also in Fre"
nch:  Dear and
 precious Friend
", Your letter of"
 the 13th has gi
ven me great de
light. So you st
"ill love me, my "
romantic Julie? 
"Separation, of w"
hich you say so
 much that is ba
"d, does not seem"
 to have had its
 usual effect o
n you. You compl
ain of our separ
ation. What then
" should I say, i"
f I dared compl
"ain, I who am de"
prived of all wh
o are dear to me
"? Ah, if
we had"
 not religion to
 console us life
 would be very s
ad. Why do you 
suppose that I s
hould look sever
ely on your affe
ction for that y
oung man? On su
ch matters I am 
only severe with
 myself. I under
stand such feel
"ings in others, "
and if never hav
ing felt them I 
cannot approve o
"f
them, neither"
 do I condemn th
em. Only it seem
s to me that Chr
"istian
love, lo"
ve of one’s ne
"ighbor, love of "
"one’s enemy, i"
"s worthier,
swe"
"eter, and better"
 than the feelin
gs which the bea
utiful eyes of a
 young man can 
inspire in a rom
antic and loving
 young girl like
 yourself.  Th
e news of Count 
Bezúkhov’s de
ath reached us b
efore your lette
r and my father
 was much affect
ed by it. He say
s the count was 
the last repres
entative but one
 of the great ce
"ntury, and that "
it is his own t
"urn now, but tha"
t he will do all
 he can to let h
is turn come as 
late as possibl
e. God preserve 
us from that ter
rible misfortune
!  I cannot ag
ree with you abo
"ut Pierre, whom "
I knew as a chil
d. He always se
emed to me to ha
ve an excellent 
"heart, and that "
is the quality I
 value most in 
people. As to hi
s inheritance an
d the part playe
d by Prince Vas
"íli, it is very"
 sad for both. A
"h, my dear frien"
"d, our divine
S"
aviour’s words
", that it is eas"
ier for a camel 
to go through th
e eye of a need
le than for a ri
ch man to enter 
the Kingdom of G
"od, are
terribl"
y true. I pity P
rince Vasíli bu
t am still more 
sorry for Pierre
".
So young, and"
 burdened with s
uch riches—to 
what temptations
 he will be exp
osed! If I were 
asked what I des
ire most on eart
"h, it would be t"
o be poorer tha
n the poorest be
ggar. A thousand
" thanks, dear fr"
"iend, for the
v"
olume you have s
ent me and which
 has such succes
s in Moscow. Yet
 since you tell
 me that among s
ome good things 
it contains othe
rs which our we
ak human underst
anding cannot gr
"asp, it seems to"
 me rather usele
ss to spend tim
e in reading wha
t is unintelligi
ble and can ther
efore bear no f
ruit. I never co
uld understand t
he fondness some
 people have for
 confusing thei
r minds by dwell
ing on mystical 
books that merel
y awaken their 
doubts and excit
e their imaginat
"ion, giving them"
 a bent for exa
ggeration quite 
contrary to Chri
stian simplicity
. Let us rather 
read the Epistl
es and Gospels. 
Let us not seek 
to penetrate wha
t mysteries the
y contain; for h
"ow can we, miser"
able sinners tha
"t we are, know t"
he terrible and
 holy secrets of
 Providence whil
e we remain in t
his flesh which
 forms an impene
trable veil betw
een us and the E
ternal? Let us 
rather confine o
urselves to stud
ying those subli
me rules which o
ur divine Savio
ur has left for 
our guidance her
e below. Let us 
try to conform 
to them and foll
"ow them, and let"
 us be persuaded
 that the less 
we let our feebl
e human minds ro
"am, the better w"
e shall please G
"od, who
rejects"
 all knowledge t
hat does not com
e from Him; and 
the less we seek
 to fathom what
 He has been ple
ased to conceal 
"from us, the soo"
ner will He vou
chsafe its revel
ation to us thro
ugh His divine S
pirit.  My fat
her has not spok
en to me of a su
"itor, but has on"
ly told me that 
he has received
 a letter and is
 expecting a vis
it from Prince V
asíli. In rega
rd to this proje
ct of marriage f
"or me, I will te"
"ll you, dear swe"
"et
friend, that"
 I look on marri
age as a divine 
institution to w
hich we must co
nform. However p
ainful it may be
" to me, should t"
he Almighty lay 
 the duties of w
ife and mother u
pon me I shall t
ry to perform th
em as faithfull
"y as I can, with"
out disquieting 
myself by examin

 toward him whom
 He may give me 
for husband.  
I have had a let

"brief one,

 five minutes l

 a look of alarm

day "
"was mapped out, "

lavichord.   
   CHAPTER XX
VI  The gray-h
aired valet was 
sitting drowsily
 listening to th
e snoring of th
"e prince, who wa"
s in his large s
tudy. From the f
ar side of the h
ouse through th
e closed doors c
ame the sound of
 difficult passa
ges—twenty ti
mes repeated—o
f a sonata by Du
ssek.  Just th
en a closed carr
iage and another
 with a hood dro
ve up to the po
rch. Prince Andr
ew got out of th
"e carriage, help"
ed his little wi
"fe to
alight, a"
nd let her pass 
into the house b
efore him. Old T
"íkhon, wearing"
"
a wig, put his "
head out of the 
door of the ante
"chamber, reporte"
d in a whisper 
that the prince 
"was sleeping, an"
d hastily closed
 the door. Tík
hon knew that ne
ither the son’
s arrival nor an
y other unusual 
 event must be a
llowed to distur
b the appointed 
order of the day
. Prince Andrew
 apparently knew
 this as well as
 Tíkhon; he loo
ked at his watch
 as if to ascer
tain whether his
 father’s habi
ts had changed s
ince he was at 
"home last, and, "
having assured h
imself that they
" had not, he
tu"
rned to his wife
.  “He will 
get up in twenty
 minutes. Let us
 go across to Ma
"ry’s
room,”"
 he said.  The
 little princess
 had grown stout
er during this t
"ime, but her eye"
s and her short
", downy, smiling"
 lip lifted when
 she began to sp
eak just as mer
rily and prettil
y as ever.  �
"�Why, this is a "
palace!” she s
aid to her husba
"nd, looking arou"
nd with the exp
ression with whi
ch people compli
ment their host 
at a ball. “L
"et’s come, qui"
"ck, quick!” An"
d with a glance 
"round, she smile"
"d at
Tíkhon, a"
"t her husband, a"
nd at the footma
n who accompanie
d them.  “Is
 that Mary pract
icing? Let’s g
o quietly and ta
ke her by surpr
ise.”  Princ
e Andrew followe
d her with a cou
rteous but sad e
xpression.  �
�You’ve grown 
"older, Tíkhon,�"
�� he said in pa
ssing to the old
" man,
who kisse"
d his hand.  B
efore they reach
ed the room from
 which the sound
s of the clavich
"ord
came, the p"
"retty, fair-hair"
"ed Frenchwoman, "
Mademoiselle Bou
"rienne,
rushed "
out apparently b
eside herself wi
th delight.  �
��Ah! what joy f
or the princess!
” exclaimed sh
e: “At last! I
 must let her k
now.”  “No
", no, please not"
... You are Made
moiselle Bourien
"ne,” said
the"
 little princess
", kissing her. �"
��I know you alr
eady through my 
 sister-in-law�
�s friendship fo
r you. She was n
ot expecting us?
”  They went
 up to the door 
of the sitting r
oom from which c
ame the sound o
f the oft-repeat
ed passage of th
e sonata. Prince
 Andrew stopped 
and made a grim
"ace, as if expec"
ting something u
npleasant.  Th
e little princes
s entered the ro
om. The passage 
broke off in the
"
middle, a cry "
"was heard, then "
Princess Mary’
s heavy tread an
d the sound of 
kissing. When Pr
ince Andrew went
 in the two prin
"cesses, who
had"
 only met once b
efore for a shor
t time at his we
"dding, were in
"
each other’s a
rms warmly press
ing their lips t
o whatever place
 they happened 
to touch. Mademo
iselle Bourienne
 stood near them
 pressing her h
and to her heart
", with a beatifi"
c smile and obvi
ously equally re
ady to cry or t
o laugh. Prince 
Andrew shrugged 
his shoulders an
"d frowned, as
l"
overs of music d
o when they hear
 a false note. T
he two women let
 go of one anot
"her, and then, a"
s if afraid of b
"eing too late, s"
eized each othe
"r’s hands, kis"
sing them and pu
"lling them away,"
 and again began
 kissing each o
ther on the face
", and then to Pr"
ince Andrew’s 
surprise both b
egan to cry and 
kissed again. Ma
demoiselle Bouri
enne also began 
to cry. Prince 
Andrew evidently
 felt ill at eas
"e, but to the tw"
o women it seem
ed quite natural
 that they shoul
"d cry, and appar"
ently it never 
entered their he
ads that it coul
d have been othe
rwise at this me
eting.  “Ah!
 my dear!... Ah!
 Mary!...” the
y suddenly excla
"imed, and then
"
laughed. “I dr
eamed last night
...”—“You 
were not expecti
ng us?...” �
"�Ah! Mary, you h"
ave got thinner?
...” “And yo
u have grown st
outer!...”  
“I knew the pr
"incess at once,�"
�� put in Mademo
iselle Bourienne
.  “And I ha
d no idea!...”
 exclaimed Princ
"ess Mary. “Ah,"
" Andrew, I
did "
not see you.” 
  Prince Andrew
" and his sister,"
" hand in hand, k"
issed one anothe
"r, and
he told "
her she was stil
l the same cryba
by as ever. Prin
cess Mary had t
urned toward her
" brother, and th"
rough her tears 
"the loving, warm"
",
gentle look o"
f her large lumi
"nous eyes, very "
beautiful at tha
"t moment,
reste"
d on Prince Andr
ew’s face.  
The little princ
ess talked inces
"santly, her shor"
"t, downy upper l"
ip continually 
and rapidly touc
hing her rosy ne
ther lip when ne
cessary and dra
wing up again ne
xt moment when h
er face broke in
to a smile of g
littering teeth 
and sparkling ey
es. She told of 
an accident they
 had had on the
 Spásski Hill w
hich might have 
been serious for
 her in her con
"dition, and imme"
diately after th
at informed them
 that she had le
ft all her clot
hes in Petersbur
g and that heave
n knew what she 
would have to d
ress in here; an
d that Andrew ha
"d quite changed,"
 and that Kitty 
 Odýntsova had 
married an old m
"an, and that the"
re was a suitor 
"for Mary,
a rea"
"l one, but that "
they would talk 
of that later. P
rincess Mary was
 still looking 
silently at her 
brother and her 
beautiful eyes w
ere full of lov
e and sadness. I
t was plain that
 she was followi
ng a train of t
hought independe
nt of her sister
-in-law’s word
s. In the midst 
of a descriptio
n of the last Pe
tersburg fete sh
e addressed her 
brother:  “S
o you are really
 going to the wa
"r, Andrew?” sh"
e said sighing. 
  Lise sighed t
"oo.

“Yes, a"
nd even tomorrow
",” replied her"
 brother.  “
He is leaving me
" here, God knows"
" why, when he mi"
ght have had pr
omotion...”  
 Princess Mary d
id not listen to
" the end, but co"
ntinuing her tra
in of thought t
urned to her sis
ter-in-law with 
a tender glance 
at her figure. 
 “Is it certa
in?” she said.
  The face of 
the little princ
ess changed. She
 sighed and said
": “Yes,
quite"
 certain. Ah! it
 is very dreadfu
l...”  Her l
ip descended. Sh
e brought her fa
ce close to her 
sister-in-law’
s and unexpecte
dly again began 
to cry.  “Sh
"e needs rest,”"
 said Prince And
rew with a frown
. “Don’t you
",
Lise? Take he"
r to your room a
nd I’ll go to 
Father. How is h
e? Just the sam
"e?”

“Yes,"
 just the same. 
Though I don’t
 know what your 
opinion will be
",” answered th"
e princess joyfu
lly.  “And a
re the hours the
 same? And the w
alks in the aven
ues? And the la
the?” asked Pr
ince Andrew with
 a scarcely perc
eptible smile wh
ich showed that
", in spite of al"
l his love and r
espect for his f
"ather, he was
a"
ware of his weak
nesses.  “Th
e hours are the 
"same, and the la"
"the, and also th"
e mathematics an
d my geometry l
"essons,” said "
Princess Mary gl
"eefully, as if h"
er lessons in g
eometry were amo
ng the greatest 
delights of her 
life.  When th
e twenty minutes
 had elapsed and
 the time had co
me for the old 
prince to get up
", Tíkhon came t"
o call the young
 prince to his f
ather. The old 
man made a depar
ture from his us
ual routine in h
onor of his son
’s arrival: he
 gave orders to 
admit him to his
 apartments whil
e he dressed fo
r dinner. The ol
d prince always 
dressed in old-f
"ashioned
style,"
 wearing an anti
que coat and pow
dered hair; and 
when Prince Andr
ew entered his 
father’s dress
ing room (not wi
th the contemptu
ous look and ma
nner he wore in 
"drawing rooms, b"
ut with the anim
ated face with w
hich he talked 
"to Pierre), the "
old man was sitt
ing on a large l
eather-covered 
"chair, wrapped i"
n a powdering ma
"ntle, entrusting"
 his head to Tí
khon.  “Ah! 
here’s the war
rior! Wants to v
anquish Buonapar
te?” said the 
"
old man, shakin"
g his powdered h
ead as much as t
"he tail, which T"
íkhon was hold
ing fast to plai

  “You at lea
st must tackle h
"im properly, or "
else if he goes 
on like this he
’ll soon have 
"us, too, for his"
 subjects! How a
re you?” And h
e held out his 
cheek.  The ol
d man was in a g
ood temper after
 his nap before 
dinner. (He use
d to say that a 
nap “after din
ner was silver�
"�before dinner,"
 golden.”) He 
"cast happy, side"
long glances at 
his son from und
"er his
thick, b"
ushy eyebrows. P

ly with more and
" more animation,"
 and from habit 
 changing uncons
ciously from Rus

s he went on—t
o explain the p
lan of operation

lained how an ar
"my,

 to threaten Pru
ssia so as to br

her neutrality a
nd draw her into
 the war; how pa

ow two hundred a

 fifty thousand 
Russians and as 
many English we
re to land at Na

total force of f

 that Tíkhon wa

king his head re
proachfully sai

APTER XXVII  A
t the appointed 
"hour the prince,"
 powdered and sh

e dining room w
here his daughte
"r-in-law, Prince"
"ss Mary, and Mad"
emoiselle Bouri
enne were alread
y awaiting him t
ogether with his
" architect, who "
by a strange ca
price of his emp
loyer’s was ad
mitted to table 
though the posi
tion of that ins
ignificant indiv
idual was such a
s could certainl
y not have caus
ed him to expect
 that honor. The
" prince, who gen"
erally kept ver
y strictly to so
cial distinction
s and rarely adm
itted even impor
tant government
 officials to hi
"s table, had une"
xpectedly select
ed Michael Ivá
novich (who alwa
ys went into a c
orner to blow hi
s nose on his c
hecked handkerch
ief) to illustra
te the theory th
at all men are e
"quals,
and had "
more than once i
mpressed on his 
daughter that Mi
chael Ivánovich
 was “not a w
hit worse than y
ou or I.” At d
inner the prince
 usually spoke 
to the taciturn 
Michael Ivánovi
ch more often th
an to anyone els
e.  In the din
"ing room, which "
like all the roo
ms in the house 
was exceedingly
" lofty, the memb"
ers of the house
hold and the foo
tmen—one behi
nd each chair—
stood waiting fo
r the prince to 
enter. The head 
"
butler, napkin "
"on arm, was scan"
ning the setting
" of the table, m"
aking signs to 
"the footmen, and"
 anxiously glanc
ing from the clo
ck to the door 
by which the pri
nce was to enter
. Prince Andrew 
was looking at a
 large gilt fra
"me, new to him, "
containing the g
enealogical tree
 of the Princes 
"
Bolkónski, opp"
osite which hung
 another such fr
ame with a badly
 painted portra
it (evidently by
 the hand of the
 artist belongin
g to the estate)
 of a ruling pr
"ince, in a crown"
—an alleged de
scendant of Rúr
ik and ancestor
 of the Bolkóns
kis. Prince Andr
"ew, looking agai"
n at that genea
"logical tree, sh"
"ook his head, la"
ughing as a man 
laughs who looks
 at a portrait 
so characteristi
c of the origina
l as to be amusi
ng.  “How th
oroughly like hi
m that is!” he
 said to Princes
"s Mary, who had"
 come up to him.
  Princess Mar
y looked at her 
brother in surpr
ise. She did not
 understand wha
t he was laughin
g at. Everything
 her father did 
inspired her wit
h reverence and
 was beyond ques
tion.  “Ever
yone has his Ach
"illes’ heel,�"
� continued Prin
ce Andrew. “F
"ancy, with his p"
"owerful mind, in"
dulging in such 
nonsense!”  
Princess Mary co
uld not understa
nd the boldness 
of her brother�
�s criticism an
d was about to r
"eply, when the e"
xpected footstep
s were heard co
ming from the st
udy. The prince 
walked in quickl
y and jauntily a
"s was
his wont,"
 as if intention
ally contrasting
 the briskness o
f his manners w
ith the strict f
ormality of his 
house. At that m
oment the great 
clock struck tw
o and another wi
th a shrill tone
 joined in from 
the drawing roo
m. The prince st
ood still; his l
ively glittering
 eyes from under
"
their thick, b"
ushy eyebrows st
ernly scanned al
l present and re
sted on the lit
tle princess. Sh
"e felt, as court"
iers do when the
" Tsar enters, th"
e sensation of 
fear and respect
 which the old m
an inspired in a
ll around him. 
He stroked her h
air and then pat
ted her awkwardl
y on the back of
 her neck.  �
"��I’m glad, gl"
"ad, to see you,�"
"�� he said, look"
ing attentively 
"into
her eyes, "
and then quickly
 went to his pla
ce and sat down.
" “Sit down,
s"
it down! Sit dow
"n, Michael Iván"
ovich!”  He 
indicated a plac
e beside him to 
his daughter-in-
law. A footman m
oved the chair 
for her.  “H
"o, ho!” said t"
"he old man, cast"
ing his eyes on 
her rounded figu
re. “You’ve
 been in a hurry
. That’s bad!�
��  He laughed
 in his usual dr
"y, cold, unpleas"
"ant way, with hi"
s lips only and
 not with his ey
es.  “You mu
"st walk, walk as"
 much as possibl
"e, as much as po"
"ssible,” he
s"
aid.  The litt
le princess did 
"not, or did not "
"wish to, hear hi"
s words. She was
 silent and see
med confused. Th
e prince asked h
er about her fat
"her, and
she be"
gan to smile and
 talk. He asked 
about mutual acq
"uaintances, and"
 she became stil
l more animated 
and chattered aw
ay giving him gr
eetings from va
rious people and
 retelling the t
own gossip.  �
��Countess Aprá
"ksina, poor thin"
"g, has lost her "
husband and she 
has cried her e
"yes out,” she "
"said, growing mo"
re and more live
ly.  As she be
came animated th
e prince looked 
at her more and 
"more sternly,
a"
"nd suddenly, as "
if he had studie
d her sufficient
ly and had forme
d a definite id

rned away and ad
dressed Michael 
Ivánovich.  �
"��Well, Michael "

 always spoke th

��has been tell
ing me what forc

d I never thoug
ht much of him.�
��  Michael Iv
ánovich did not
 at all know whe
n “you and I�
� had said such
 things about Bo
"naparte, but und"
erstanding that 
he was wanted as
 a peg on which
 to hang the pri
nce’s favorite
" topic, he looke"
d inquiringly a
t the young prin
"ce, wondering wh"
at would follow.
  “He is a g
reat tactician!�
�� said the prin
"ce to his son, p"
ointing to the 
architect.  An
d the conversati
on again turned 
"on the war, on B"
"onaparte, and th"
e generals and 
statesmen of the
 day. The old pr
ince seemed conv
inced not only 
that all the men
 of the day were
 mere babies who
 did not know th
e A B C of war 
"or of politics, "
and that Bonapar
te was an insign
ificant little 
"Frenchy, success"
ful only because
 there were no l
onger any Potë
mkins or Suvóro
vs left to oppos
e him; but he wa
s also convinced
 that there wer
e no political d
ifficulties in E
urope and no rea
"l war,
but only"
 a sort of puppe
t show at which 
the men of the d
"ay were playing,"
 pretending to 
do something rea
l. Prince Andrew
 gaily bore with
 his father’s
 ridicule of the
" new men, and dr"
ew him on and li
stened to him w
ith evident plea
sure.  “The 
past always seem
"s good,” said "
"he, “but did n"
ot Suvórov him
self fall into a
 trap Moreau set
" him, and from w"
hich he did not 
know how to esc
ape?”  “Wh
o told you that?
 Who?” cried t
he prince. “Su
vórov!” And h
e jerked away h
"is plate, which "
Tíkhon briskly 
caught. “Suvó

"r, Prince Andrew"
. Two... Frederi

 Moreau!... Mor

f Suvórov had h
ad a free hand;

�� said Prince 
"Andrew, “I am "
only surprised a
t your opinion o
f Bonaparte. You
 may laugh as m
"uch as you like,"
 but all the sam
e Bonaparte is a

”  “Michae

 cried the old p
rince to the arc
"hitect who,

y with his roast
" meat, hoped he "
had been forgott
en: “Didn’t 
 I tell you Buon
aparte was a gre
at tactician? He
"re, he says the "
same thing.” 
  “To be sure
", your excellenc"
"y,” replied th"
e architect.  
The prince again
 laughed his fri
gid laugh.  �
�Buonaparte was 
born with a silv
er spoon in his 
mouth. He has go
t splendid sold
iers. Besides he
 began by attack
ing Germans. And
 only idlers ha
ve failed to bea
t the Germans. S
ince the world b
egan everybody 
has beaten the G

t no one—excep
t one another. H

tation fighting 
them.”  And 
the prince began
 explaining all 
the blunders whi
"ch, according to"
"
him, Bonaparte"
 had made in his
 campaigns and e
ven in politics.
 His son made n
"o rejoinder, but"
 it was evident 
that whatever ar
guments were pr
esented he was a
s little able as
 his father to c
hange his opinio
"n. He
listened,"
 refraining from
" a reply, and in"
voluntarily wond
ered how this o
"ld man, living a"
lone in the coun
try for so many 
"years, could kno"
w and discuss s
o minutely and a
cutely all the r
ecent European m
ilitary and pol
itical events. 
 “You think I
’m an old man 
and don’t unde
rstand the prese

airs?” conclud
ed his father. �
��But it trouble
s me. I don’t 
 sleep at night.
" Come now, where"
 has this great 
commander of you
rs shown his sk

uded.  “That
 would take too 
"long to tell,”"
 answered the so
"n.

“Well, t"

ademoiselle Bour

"
exclaimed in exc

"
“You know, P"

a Bonapartist!�
�  “Dieu sai

 prince out of t
"une and, with
a"
 laugh still mor
"e so, he quitted"
 the table.  T
he little prince
ss during the wh
ole discussion a
nd the rest of 
the dinner sat s
"ilent, glancing "
with a frightene
d look now at he
r father-in-law
 and now at Prin

they left the ta
ble she took he
r sister-in-law�

 her into anothe

 Princess Mary. 
      CHAPT
ER XXVIII  Pri
nce Andrew was t
o leave next eve
ning. The old pr
"ince, not alteri"
"ng
his routine,"
 retired as usua
l after dinner. 
The little princ
ess was in her 
sister-in-law’
s room. Prince A
ndrew in a trave
ling coat withou
t epaulettes ha
d been packing w
ith his valet in
 the rooms assig
ned to him. Aft
er inspecting th
e carriage himse
lf and seeing th
"e trunks put in,"
 he ordered the
 horses to be ha
rnessed. Only th
ose things he al
ways kept with 
him remained in 
his room; a smal
"l box, a large c"
anteen fitted w
ith silver plate
", two Turkish pi"
stols and a sabe
r—a present fr
om his father w
ho had brought i
t from the siege
 of Ochákov. Al
l these traveli
ng effects of Pr
ince Andrew’s 
were in very goo
"d order: new,
c"
"lean, and in clo"
th covers carefu
lly tied with ta
pes.  When sta
rting on a journ
ey or changing t
heir mode of lif
"e, men capable
"
of reflection ar
e generally in a
 serious frame o
f mind. At such 
moments one rev
iews the past an
d plans for the 
future. Prince A
ndrew’s face 
looked very thou
ghtful and tende
r. With his hand
s behind him he 
paced briskly f
rom corner to co
rner of the room
", looking straig"
ht before him a
nd thoughtfully 
shaking his head
. Did he fear go
"ing to the war, "
or was he sad a
t leaving his wi
fe?—perhaps bo
"th, but evidentl"
y he did not wi
sh to be seen in
" that mood, for "
hearing footstep
s in the passage
 he hurriedly u
nclasped his han
"ds, stopped at a"
 table as if tyi
ng the cover of
" the small box, "
and assumed his 
usual tranquil a
nd impenetrable 
 expression. It 
was the heavy tr
ead of Princess 
Mary that he hea
rd.  “I hear
 you have given 
orders to harnes
"s,” she cried,"
 panting (she h
ad apparently be
"en running), “"
and I did so wis
h to have anothe
r talk with you
 alone! God know
s how long we ma
y again be parte
d. You are not 
angry with me fo
r coming? You ha
"ve changed so, A"
"ndrúsha,” she"
" added,
as if t"
o explain such a
 question.  Sh
e smiled as she 
uttered his pet 
"name, “Andrús"
ha.” It was o
bviously strange
 to her to think
 that this stern
 handsome man sh
ould be Andrús
ha—the slender
 mischievous boy
 who had been he
r playfellow in 
 childhood.  �
��And where is L
ise?” he asked
", answering her "
question only by
 a smile.  �
�She was so tire
d that she has f
allen asleep on 
the sofa in my r
"oom.
Oh, Andrew"
! What a treasur
e of a wife you 
"have,” said sh"
"e, sitting
down"
" on the sofa, fa"
cing her brother
. “She is quit
e a child: such 
"a
dear, merry c"
hild. I have gro
wn so fond of he
r.”  Prince 
Andrew was silen
"t, but the princ"
ess noticed the 
ironical and co
ntemptuous look 
that showed itse
lf on his face. 
  “One must b
e indulgent to l
ittle weaknesses
; who is free fr
"om them,
Andrew"
? Don’t forget
 that she has gr
own up and been 
educated in soc
"iety, and so her"
 position now is
 not a rosy one.
 We should enter
 into everyone�
��s situation. T
"out comprendre, "
c’est tout par
donner. * Think 
 what it must be
" for her, poor t"
"hing, after what"
 she has been us
"ed to,
to be pa"
rted from her hu
sband and be lef
t alone in the c
"ountry, in her
"
condition! It’
s very hard.” 
       * To und
erstand all is t
o forgive all. 
 Prince Andrew 
smiled as he loo
ked at his siste
"r, as we smile a"
t those we thin
k we thoroughly 
understand.  �
��You live in th
e country and do
n’t think the 
"life terrible,�"
� he replied. 
 “I... that�
�s different. Wh
y speak of me? I
 don’t want an
"y other
life, a"
"nd can’t, for "
I know no other.
" But think, Andr"
ew: for a young 
 society woman t
o be buried in t
he country durin
g the best years
" of her
life, a"
ll alone—for P
apa is always bu
"sy, and I... wel"
"l, you know what"
 poor resources
 I have for ente
rtaining a woman
 used to the bes
t society. Ther
e is only Mademo
iselle Bourienne
....”  “I 
don’t like you
r Mademoiselle B
"ourienne at all,"
” said Prince 
 Andrew.  “N
o? She is very n
ice and kind and
", above all, she"
’s much to be 
 pitied. She has
" no one, no one."
 To tell the tru
"th, I don’t ne"
"ed her,
and she"
’s even in my 
way. You know I 
always was a sav
"age, and now am"
 even more so. I
 like being alon
e.... Father lik
es her very much
. She and Micha
el Ivánovich ar
e the two people
 to whom he is a
lways gentle and
"
kind, because "
he has been a be
nefactor to them
 both. As Sterne
 says: ‘We do
n’t love peopl
e so much for th
e good they have
" done us, as
fo"
r the good we ha
ve done them.’
 Father took her
 when she was ho
meless after lo
sing her own fat
her. She is very
" good-natured, a"
nd my father li
kes her way of r
eading. She read
s to him in the 
evenings and rea
ds splendidly.�
��  “To be q
"uite frank, Mary"
", I expect Fathe"
r’s character 
sometimes makes
 things trying f
"or you, doesn’"
t it?” Prince 
Andrew asked su
ddenly.  Princ
ess Mary was fir
st surprised and
 then aghast at 
this question. 
 “For me? For
 me?... Trying f
or me!...” sai
d she.  “He 
always was rathe
r harsh; and now
 I should think 
he’s getting 
"very trying,” "
said Prince Andr
"ew, apparently s"
peaking lightly 
of their father
 in order to puz
zle or test his 
sister.  “Yo
u are good in ev
"ery way, Andrew,"
 but you have a 
kind of intelle
"ctual pride,” "
said the princes
"s, following the"
 train of her ow
n thoughts rath
er than the tren
d of the convers
ation—“and t
hat’s a great
 sin. How can on
e judge Father? 
But even if one 
"might, what feel"
ing except vene
ration could suc
h a man as my fa
ther evoke? And 
I am so content
ed and happy wit
h him. I only wi
sh you were all

 will tell you t

w... is Father�
�s way of treati

Andrew bantering
ly yet tenderly.
  “Ah! mon a

 and hope that G

 Andrew...” s
he said timidly 
after a moment�
"�s silence, “I"
 have a great f
avor to ask of y
ou.”  “Wha
"t is it, dear?�"
�  “No—pro
mise that you wi

it will comfort

"aid she, putting"
 her hand in her
 reticule but no
t yet taking ou
t what she was h
olding inside it
", as if what she"
 held were the 
subject of her r
equest and must 
not be shown bef
ore the request 
was granted.  
 She looked timi
dly at her broth
er.  “Even i
f it were a grea
t deal of troubl

" Prince Andrew,"
 as if guessing 
what it was abou
t.  “Think w
hat you please! 
I know you are j
ust like Father.
 Think as you p
"lease, but do th"
is for my sake! 
Please do! Fathe
"r’s father, ou"
"r

 still did not t
ake out what sh
e was holding in
 her reticule.) 
“So you promis

ourse. What is i
t?”  “Andr
"ew, I bless you "
with this icon a

 never take it o

To please you...
” said Prince 
Andrew. But imme
"diately, noticin"
g the pained ex
pression his jok
e had brought to
 his sister’s 
"face, he
repent"
ed and added: �
�I am glad; real
"ly, dear, I am v"
ery glad.”  
“Against your 
will He will sav
e and have mercy
 on you and brin
g you to Himsel
"f, for in Him al"
one is truth and
" peace,” said "
she in a voice 
trembling with e
"motion, solemnly"
 holding up in b
oth hands before
 her brother a 
"small, oval, ant"
"ique, dark-faced"
 icon of the Sav
iour in a gold 
"setting, on a fi"
nely wrought sil
ver chain.  Sh
e crossed hersel
"f, kissed the ic"
"on, and handed i"
t to Andrew.  
"“Please, Andre"
"w, for my sake!."
..”  Rays of
 gentle light sh
one from her lar
"ge, timid eyes. "
Those eyes lit 
up the whole of 
"her thin, sickly"
 face and made i
t beautiful. Her
 brother would 
have taken the i
"con, but she sto"
pped him. Andrew
" understood,
cr"
ossed himself an
d kissed the ico
n. There was a l
ook of tendernes
"s, for
he was t"
"ouched, but also"
 a gleam of iron
y on his face. 
"
“Thank you, "
my dear.” She 
kissed him on th
e forehead and s
at down again o
n the sofa. They
 were silent for
 a while.  “
As I was saying 
"to you, Andrew, "
be kind and gene
rous as you alwa
ys used to be. 
Don’t judge Li
"se harshly,” s"
he began. “She
" is so
sweet, s"
"o good-natured, "
and her position
 now is a very h
ard one.”  �
��I do not think
 I have complain
ed of my wife to
" you, Másha, or"
 blamed her. Wh
y do you say all
 this to me?” 
  Red patches a
ppeared on Princ
ess Mary’s fac
e and she was si
lent as if she 
felt guilty.  
“I have said n
"othing to you, b"
ut you have alre
ady been talked 
to. And I am so
"rry for that,”"
 he went on.  
The patches grew
 deeper on her f
"orehead, neck, a"
nd cheeks. She t
ried to say som
ething but could
 not. Her brothe
r had guessed ri
ght: the little 
 princess had be
en crying after 
dinner and had s
poken of her for
ebodings about 
"her confinement,"
 and how she dre
"aded it, and had"
 complained of h
"er
fate, her fa"
"ther-in-law, and"
 her husband. Af
ter crying she h
ad fallen aslee
p. Prince Andrew
 felt sorry for 
his sister.  �
"��Know this, Má"
sha: I can’t r
"eproach, have no"
"t reproached, an"
d never shall r
eproach my wife 
"with anything, a"

ed. But if you w
ant to know the 
truth... if you
 want to know wh
ether I am happy
? No! Is she hap
py? No! But why 
this is so I do
n’t know...”
  As he said t
"his he rose, wen"
"t to his sister,"
" and, stooping, "
kissed her fore
head. His fine e
yes lit up with 
"a thoughtful, ki"
"ndly, and
unacc"
ustomed brightne
"ss, but he was l"
ooking not at hi
s sister but ove
r her head towa
rd the darkness 
of the open door
way.  “Let u
"s go to her, I m"
ust say good-by.
 Or—go and wak
e and I’ll co
me in a moment. 
Petrúshka!” h
e called to his 
valet: “Come h
"ere,
take these"
 away. Put this 
on the seat and 
this to the righ

s Mary rose and 
moved to the doo
"r, then stopped "
and said: “An

God and asked Hi

"l, maybe!” sai"
d Prince Andrew.
" “Go, Másha; "
I’ll come imm
ediately.”  
On the way to hi
s sister’s roo
"m, in the passag"
e which connecte
d one wing with
" the other, Prin"
ce Andrew met Ma
demoiselle Bouri
enne smiling sw
eetly. It was th
e third time tha
"t day that, with"
 an ecstatic and
"
artless smile,"
 she had met him
 in secluded pas
sages.  “Oh!
 I thought you w
ere in your room
",” she said, f"
or some reason 
blushing and dro
pping her eyes. 
  Prince Andrew
 looked sternly 
at her and an ex
pression of ange
r suddenly came
 over his face. 
He said nothing 
to her but looke
d at her forehea
"d
and hair, wit"
hout looking at 
"her eyes, with s"
uch contempt tha
t the Frenchwom
an blushed and w
ent away without
 a word. When he
 reached his si
ster’s room hi
s wife was alrea
dy awake and her
" merry voice, hu"
rrying one word
" after another, "
came through the
 open door. She 
was speaking as 
 usual in French
", and as if afte"
r long self-rest
raint she wished
 to make up for
 lost time.  �
"��No, but imagin"
e the old Counte
"ss Zúbova, with"
 false curls and
 her mouth full
" of false teeth,"
 as if she were 
trying to cheat 
"old age....
Ha,"
" ha, ha! Mary!�"
�  This very s
entence about Co
untess Zúbova a
nd this same lau
gh Prince Andre
w had already he
ard from his wif
e in the presenc
e of others some
 five times. He
 entered the roo
m softly. The li
"ttle princess, p"
"lump and
rosy, "
was sitting in a
n easy chair wit
h her work in he
"r hands, talking"
"
incessantly, r"
epeating Petersb
urg reminiscence
s and even phras
es. Prince Andr
"ew came up, stro"
"ked her hair, an"
d asked if she f
elt rested after
 their journey.
 She answered hi
m and continued 
her chatter.  
The coach with s
ix horses was wa
iting at the por
ch. It was an au
"tumn
night, so "
dark that the co
achman could not
 see the carriag
e pole. Servant
s with lanterns 
were bustling ab
out in the porch
. The immense h
ouse was brillia
nt with lights s
hining through i
ts lofty windows
. The domestic 
serfs were crowd
"ing in the hall,"
 waiting to bid 
good-by to the 
young prince. Th
e members of the
 household were 
all gathered in 
the reception h
all: Michael Iv�
"�novich, Mademoi"
"selle Bourienne,"
" Princess
Mary,"
 and the little 
princess. Prince
 Andrew had been
 called to his 
father’s study
 as the latter w
ished to say goo
d-by to him alon
e. All were wai
ting for them to
 come out.  Wh
en Prince Andrew
 entered the stu
dy the old man i
n his old-age s
pectacles and wh
ite dressing gow
"n, in which he r"
eceived no one b
"ut his
son, sat"
 at the table wr
iting. He glance
d round.  “G
oing?” And he 
went on writing.
  “I’ve co
me to say good-b
y.”  “Kiss
" me here,” and"
 he touched his 
cheek: “Thanks
", thanks!”

"
“What do you t
hank me for?” 
  “For not di
lly-dallying and
 not hanging to 
a woman’s apro
n strings. The 
Service before e
verything. Thank
"s, thanks!” An"
d he went on wr
"iting, so that h"
is quill splutte
red and squeaked
. “If you have
 anything to sa
"y, say it. These"
 two things can 
be done together
",” he
added."
  “About my w
ife... I am asha
med as it is to 
leave her on you
r hands....” 
  “Why talk n
onsense? Say wha
t you want.” 
 “When her co
nfinement is due
", send to Moscow"
 for an accouche
ur.... Let him 
be here....” 
 The old prince
 stopped writing
" and, as if not "
"understanding, f"
ixed his stern 
eyes on his son.
  “I know th
at no one can he
lp if nature doe
s not do her wor

Prin"
"ce Andrew, evide"
ntly confused. �
��I know that ou
t of a million 
cases only one g
"oes wrong, but i"
t is her fancy a
nd mine. They ha
ve been telling
 her things. She
 has had a dream
 and is frighten
ed.”  “Hm.
.. Hm...” mutt
ered the old pri
"nce to himself, "
finishing what h
e was writing. 
“I’ll do it.
”  He signed
 with a flourish
 and suddenly tu
rning to his son
 began to laugh
.  “It’s a
" bad business, e"
h?”  “What
" is bad, Father?"
”  “The wi
fe!” said the 
"old prince, brie"
fly and signific
antly.  “I d
on’t understan
d!” said Princ
e Andrew.  “
"No, it can’t b"
"e helped, lad,�"
� said the princ
e. “They’re 
 all like that; 
one can’t unma
rry. Don’t be 
afraid; I won’
"t tell
anyone, "
but you know it 
yourself.”  
He seized his so
n by the hand wi
th small bony fi
"ngers, shook it,"
 looked straigh
t into his son�
�s face with kee
n eyes which see
med to see thro
"ugh him, and aga"
in laughed his f
rigid laugh.  
"The son sighed, "
thus admitting t
hat his father h
ad understood hi
m. The old man 
continued to fol
d and seal his l
"etter, snatching"
 up and throwing
"
down the wax, "
"the seal, and th"
"e paper, with hi"
s accustomed rap
idity.  “Wha
t’s to be done
? She’s pretty
! I will do ever
ything. Make you
"r
mind easy,”"
 said he in abru
pt sentences whi
le sealing his l
etter.  Andrew
 did not speak; 
he was both plea
sed and displeas
ed that his fath
er understood h
im. The old man 
got up and gave 
the letter to hi
s son.  “Lis
ten!” said he;
 “don’t worr
y about your wif
e: what can be 
done shall be. N
ow listen! Give 
this letter to M

   *Kutúzov.  
 He spoke so rap
idly that he did
 not finish half
" his words, but "
his son was acc
ustomed to under
stand him. He le
d him to the des

l"

out an exercise

ew did not tell 
his father that

 that he must no

I will do it all

said.  “Well

�� He gave his s
on his hand to k

�  “You need

on with a smile

 was silent.  
“I also wanted

Not let the wife

"id the old man, "
and laughed.  
They stood silen

an’s sharp eye

raight on his so

 twitched in the

the old prince�

�What is it? Wha

 Prince Andrew

 He embraced her

"“Adieu, Mary,�"

      BOOK
 TWO: 1805   
   CHAPTER I 
"

In October, 1"
"805, a Russian a"
rmy was occupyin
g the villages a
nd towns of the
 Archduchy of Au
"stria, and yet o"
ther regiments f
reshly arriving 
from Russia wer
e settling near 
the fortress of 
Braunau and burd
ening the inhab
itants on whom t
hey were quarter
ed. Braunau was 
the headquarters
 of the command
"er in chief, Kut"
úzov.  On Oct
"ober 11, 1805, o"
ne of the infant
ry regiments tha
t had just reach
ed Braunau had 
halted half a mi
le from the town
", waiting to be "
inspected by th
e commander in c
hief. Despite th
e un-Russian app
earance of the 
locality and sur
roundings—frui
"t gardens, stone"
" fences, tiled r"
"oofs,
and hills"
 in the distance
—and despite t
he fact that the
 inhabitants (w
ho gazed with cu
riosity at the s
oldiers) were no
"t Russians, the"
 regiment had ju
st the appearanc
e of any Russian
 regiment prepar
ing for an insp
ection anywhere 
in the heart of 
Russia.  On th
e evening of the
 last day’s ma
rch an order had
 been received t
hat the command
er in chief woul
d inspect the re
giment on the ma
rch. Though the
 words of the or
der were not cle
ar to the regime
"ntal commander, "
and the questio
n arose whether 
the troops were 
to be in marchin
"g order or
not,"
 it was decided 
at a consultatio
n between the ba
ttalion commande
rs to present t
he regiment in p
"arade order, on "
the principle th
at it is always
 better to “bo
w too low than n
ot bow low enoug
h.” So the so
"ldiers, after a "
twenty-mile marc
"h, were kept men"
ding and cleanin
g all night lon
g without closin
"g their eyes, wh"
ile the adjutant
s and company c
ommanders calcul
ated and reckone
"d, and by mornin"
g the regiment�
��instead of the
" straggling, dis"
orderly crowd it
 had been on it
s last march the
 day before—pr
esented a well-o
rdered array of 
two thousand me
n each of whom k
new his place an
"d his duty, had "
every button an
d every strap in
" place, and shon"
e with cleanline
ss. And not only
 externally was
" all in order, b"
ut had it please
d the commander 
in chief to loo
k under the unif
orms he would ha
ve found on ever
y man a clean s
"hirt, and in eve"
ry knapsack the 
appointed number
" of articles, �"
"�awl,
soap, and"
" all,” as the "
soldiers say. Th
ere was only one
 circumstance c
oncerning which 
no one could be 
at ease. It was 
the state of the
 soldiers’ bo
ots. More than h
alf the men’s 
boots were in ho
les. But this d
efect was not du
e to any fault o
f the regimental
" commander, for"
 in spite of rep
eated demands bo
ots had not been
 issued by the A
ustrian commiss
"ariat, and the r"
egiment had marc
hed some seven h
undred miles.  
 The commander o
f the regiment w
"as an elderly, c"
"holeric, stout, "
and thick-set g
eneral with griz
zled eyebrows an
"d whiskers, and "
wider from ches
t to back than a
cross the should
ers. He had on a
 brand-new unifo
rm showing the 
creases where it
 had been folded
 and thick gold 
epaulettes whic
h seemed to stan
d rather than li
e down on his ma
ssive shoulders.
 He had the air
 of a man happil
y performing one
 of the most sol
emn duties of h
is life. He walk
ed about in fron
t of the line an
d at every step 
pulled himself 
"up, slightly arc"
hing his back. I
t was plain that
 the commander 
admired his regi
"ment, rejoiced i"
"n it, and that h"
is whole mind wa
s engrossed by 
"it, yet his stru"
t seemed to indi
"cate that, besid"
es military mat
"ters, social int"
erests and the f
air sex occupied
 no small part o
f his thoughts.
"

“Well, Mic"
"hael Mítrich, s"
"ir?” he said, "
addressing one o
f the battalion
 commanders who 
smilingly presse
d forward (it wa
s plain that th
ey both felt hap
py). “We had o
ur hands full la
st night. Howeve
"r, I
think the "
regiment is not 
"a bad one, eh?�"
�  The battali
on commander per
ceived the jovia
l irony and laug
hed.  “It wo
uld not be turne
d off the field 
even on the Tsar
ítsin Meadow.�
��  “What?�
� asked the comm
ander.  At tha
"t moment, on the"
 road from the t
own on which sig
nalers had been 
"
posted, two men"
 appeared on hor
se back. They we
re an aide-de-ca

a Cossack.  Th

A member of the

mong other argum

"of his view,
to"
 show the Austri
an general the w
retched state in
 which the troop

Russia. With thi
s object he inte
nded to meet the
 regiment; so t
he worse the con
dition it was in

ased the command

definite order t
hat the men sho
uld be in their

ently shrugged h

  “A fine mes

eral....”  T
he regimental co
"mmander, going u"
p to the line hi
"mself, ordered t"
he soldiers to 
change into thei
r greatcoats. Th
e company comman
ders ran off to
 their companies
", the sergeants "
major began bust
ling (the greatc
oats were not i
n very good cond
"ition), and inst"
antly the square
s that had up t
o then been in r
egular order and
 silent began to
 sway and stretc
h and hum with 
voices. On all s
ides soldiers we
re running to an
"d fro, throwing"
 up their knapsa
cks with a jerk 
of their shoulde
rs and pulling t
he straps over 
"their heads, uns"
trapping their o
vercoats and dra
wing the sleeves
 on with uprais
ed arms.  In h
alf an hour all 
was again in ord
"er, only the squ"
ares had become 
gray instead of
 black. The regi
mental commander
 walked with his
 jerky steps to
 the front of th
e regiment and e
xamined it from 
a distance.  �
��Whatever is th
is? This!” he 
shouted and stoo
d still. “Comm
ander of the th
ird company!” 
  “Commander 
of the third com
pany wanted by t
he general!... c
ommander to the
 general... thir
d company to the
 commander.” T
he words passed 
along the lines
 and an adjutant
 ran to look for
 the missing off
icer.  When th
e eager but misr
epeated words ha
d reached their 
destination in 
a cry of: “The
 general to the 
"third company,�"
� the missing of
ficer appeared 
from behind his 
"company and, tho"
ugh he was a mid
dle-aged man an
d not in the hab
"it of running, t"
rotted awkwardly
 stumbling on hi
s toes toward t
he general. The 
captain’s face
 showed the unea
siness of a sch
oolboy who is to
ld to repeat a l
esson he has not
 learned. Spots 
 appeared on his
" nose, the redne"
ss of which was 
evidently due to
"
intemperance, "
and his mouth tw
itched nervously
. The general lo
oked the captai
n up and down as
 he came up pant
"ing, slackening "
his pace as he 
approached.  �
��You will soon 
be dressing your
 men in petticoa
ts! What is this
?” shouted th
e regimental com
"mander, thrustin"
g forward his ja
w and pointing 
at a soldier in 
the ranks of the
 third company i
n a greatcoat of
" bluish
cloth, "
which contrasted
 with the others
. “What have y
ou been after? 
The commander in
 chief is expect
ed and you leave
 your place? Eh?
 I’ll teach y
ou to dress the 
men in fancy coa
ts for a parade.
... Eh...?”  
 The commander o
"f the company, w"
ith his eyes fix
ed on his superi
"or,
pressed two"
 fingers more an
d more rigidly t
"o his cap, as if"
 in this pressu
re lay his only 
hope of salvatio
"n.

“Well, w"
hy don’t you s
peak? Whom have 
you got there dr
essed up as a H
ungarian?” sai
d the commander 
with an austere 
gibe.  “Your

"�

“Well, yo"
"ur excellency, w"
hat? Your excell
ency! But what a
bout your excel
lency?... nobody
 knows.”  �
�Your excellency
", it’s the off"
"icer Dólokhov, "
who has been red
uced to the ran
"ks,” said the "
captain softly. 
  “Well? Has 
he been degraded
 into a field ma
"rshal, or into a"
 soldier? If a 
"soldier, he shou"
ld be dressed in
 regulation unif
orm like the ot
hers.”  “Y
"our excellency, "
you gave him lea
"ve yourself, on "
the march.”  
 “Gave him lea
ve? Leave? That�
��s just like yo
"u young men,” "
said the regime
ntal commander c
ooling down a li
ttle. “Leave i
ndeed.... One sa
ys a word to yo
u and you... Wha
t?” he added w
ith renewed irri
"tation, “I
be"
g you to dress y
our men decently
.”  And the 
"commander, turni"
ng to look at th
"e adjutant, dire"
cted his jerky 
steps down the l
ine. He was evid
ently pleased at
 his own display
 of anger and w
alking up to the
 regiment wished
 to find a furth
er excuse for w
rath. Having sna
pped at an offic
er for an unpoli
"shed badge, at a"
nother because 
his line was not
" straight, he re"
ached the third 
company.  “H
-o-o-w are you s
tanding? Where�
�s your leg? You
r leg?” shoute
d the commander
 with a tone of 
suffering in his
" voice, while th"
ere were still 
five men between
 him and Dólokh
ov with his blui
sh-gray uniform.
  Dólokhov sl
owly straightene
"d his bent knee,"
 looking straigh
t with his clea
"r, insolent eyes"
 in the general�
��s face.  “
Why a blue coat?
 Off with it... 
Sergeant major! 
Change his coat.
.. the ras...�
� he did not fin
ish.  “Gener
"al, I must obey "
"orders, but I am"
 not bound to en
dure...” Dól
okhov hurriedly 
interrupted.  
“No talking in
 the ranks!... N
"o talking, no ta"
lking!”  “
Not bound to end
"ure insults,” "
Dólokhov conclu
"ded in loud, rin"
ging tones.  
The eyes of the 
general and the 
soldier met. The
 general became 
"silent,
angrily"
 pulling down hi
s tight scarf. 
 “I request y
ou to have the g
oodness to chang
"e your coat,” "
he said as he t
urned away.   
    CHAPTER I
I  “He’s c
oming!” shoute
d the signaler a
t that moment. 
 The regimental
" commander, flus"
"hing, ran to his"
" horse, seized t"
he stirrup with
 trembling hands
", threw his body"
 across the sadd
"le, righted hims"
"elf,
drew his s"
"aber, and with a"
 happy and resol
"ute countenance,"
 opening his mo
"uth awry, prepar"
ed to shout. The
 regiment flutte
red like a bird 
 preening its pl
umage and became
 motionless.  
“Att-ention!�
� shouted the re
gimental command
er in a soul-sha
king voice whic
h expressed joy 
"for himself, sev"
erity for the re
"giment, and
wel"
come for the app
roaching chief. 
  Along the bro
"ad country road,"
 edged on both s
"ides by trees, c"
"ame a high,
lig"
ht blue Viennese
" calèche, sligh"
tly creaking on 
its springs and 
drawn by six ho
rses at a smart 
trot. Behind the
 calèche gallop
ed the suite an
d a convoy of Cr
oats. Beside Kut
úzov sat an Aus
"trian general, i"
n a white unifo
rm that looked s
trange among the
 Russian black o
nes. The calèc
he stopped in fr
ont of the regim
ent. Kutúzov an
d the Austrian 
general were tal
king in low voic
es and Kutúzov 
smiled slightly 
as treading hea
vily he stepped 
down from the ca
rriage just as i
f those two tho
usand men breath
lessly gazing at
 him and the reg
imental commande
r did not exist
.  The word of
 command rang ou
"t, and again the"
 regiment quiver
"ed, as with a
j"
ingling sound it
 presented arms.
 Then amidst a d
ead silence the 
 feeble voice of
 the commander i
n chief was hear
d. The regiment 
"roared,
“Heal"
th to your ex...
 len... len... l
ency!” and aga
in all became s
ilent. At first 
Kutúzov stood s
till while the r
egiment moved; t
hen he and the 
general in white
", accompanied by"
" the suite, walk"
ed between the 
ranks.  From t
he way the regim
ental commander 
saluted the comm
ander in chief a
nd devoured him
" with his eyes, "
drawing himself 
"up obsequiously,"
 and from the w
ay he walked thr
ough the ranks b
ehind the genera
"ls, bending forw"
ard and hardly 
able to restrain
 his jerky movem
"ents, and from t"
he way he darte
d forward at eve
ry word or gestu
re of the comman
"der in chief,
i"
t was evident th
at he performed 
his duty as a su
bordinate with e
ven greater zea
l than his duty 
as a commander. 
Thanks to the st
rictness and as
siduity of its c
ommander the reg
"iment, in compar"
ison with others
 that had reach
ed Braunau at th
"e same time, was"
 in splendid con
dition. There w
ere only 217 sic
k and stragglers
. Everything was
 in good order e
xcept the boots
.  Kutúzov wa
lked through the
" ranks, sometime"
s stopping to sa
y a few friendl
y words to offic
ers he had known
 in the Turkish 
"war, sometimes
"
also to the sold
iers. Looking at
 their boots he 
several times sh
ook his head sa
"dly, pointing th"
em out to the Au
strian general w
ith an expressio
n which seemed 
to say that he w
as not blaming a
"nyone, but could"
 not help notic
ing what a bad s
tate of things i
t was. The regim
ental commander 
 ran forward on 
each such occasi
"on, fearing to m"
iss a single wor
d of the comman
der in chief’s
 regarding the r
egiment. Behind 
"Kutúzov, at a
"
distance that al
lowed every soft
ly spoken word t
"o be heard, foll"
owed some twent
y men of his sui
te. These gentle
men talked among
 themselves and
 sometimes laugh
ed. Nearest of a
ll to the comman
der in chief wal
ked a handsome 
adjutant. This w
as Prince Bolkó
nski. Beside him
 was his comrad
"e Nesvítski, a "
tall staff offic
"er, extremely st"
"out, with a
kin"
"dly, smiling, ha"
ndsome face and 
moist eyes. Nesv
ítski could har
dly keep from l
aughter provoked
 by a swarthy hu
ssar officer who
 walked beside 
him. This hussar
", with a grave f"
ace and without 
a smile or a ch
ange in the expr
ession of his fi
"xed eyes, watche"
d the regimental
 commander’s 
back and mimicke
d his every move
ment. Each time 
the commander s
tarted and bent 
"forward, the hus"
sar started and 
bent forward in
 exactly the sam
e manner. Nesví
tski laughed and
 nudged the othe
rs to make them
 look at the wag
.  Kutúzov wa
lked slowly and 
languidly past t
housands of eyes
 which were sta
rting from their
 sockets to watc
h their chief. O
n reaching the 
third company he
 suddenly stoppe
"d. His suite, no"
t having expecte
"d this,
involun"
tarily came clos
er to him.  �
"�Ah, Timókhin!�"
"�� said he, reco"
gnizing the red-
nosed captain wh
o had been repr
imanded on accou
nt of the blue g
reatcoat.  One
 would have thou
ght it impossibl
e for a man to s
tretch himself 
more than Timók
hin had done whe
n he was reprima
nded by the regi
mental commande
"r, but now that "
the commander in
 chief addressed
 him he drew hi
mself up to such
 an extent that 
it seemed he cou
ld not have sust
ained it had th
e commander in c
hief continued t
"o look at him, a"
"nd so Kutúzov,"
 who evidently u
nderstood his ca
se and wished hi
m nothing but go
"od,
quickly tur"
"ned away, a scar"
cely perceptible
 smile flitting 
over his scarre
d and puffy face
.  “Another 
"Ismail comrade,�"
�� said he. “A
 brave officer! 
Are you satisfi
ed with him?” 
he asked the reg
imental commande
r.  And the la
tter—unconscio
us that he was b
eing reflected i
n the hussar of
ficer as in a lo
oking glass—st
"arted, moved for"
"ward, and answer"
ed: “Highly s
"atisfied, your e"
xcellency!”  
 “We all have 
"our weaknesses,�"
�� said Kutúzov
 smiling and wal
king away from 
him. “He used 
to have a predil
ection for Bacch
us.”  The re
gimental command
er was afraid he
 might be blamed
 for this and di
d not answer. T
he hussar at tha
t moment noticed
 the face of the
 red-nosed capt
ain and his draw
"n-in stomach, an"
d mimicked his e
xpression and po
se with such ex
actitude that Ne
svítski could n
ot help laughing
. Kutúzov turn
ed round. The of
ficer evidently 
had complete con
trol of his face
",
and while Kut"
úzov was turnin
g managed to mak
e a grimace and 
then assume a m
"ost serious, def"
"erential, and in"
nocent expressio
n.  The third 
company was the 
"last, and Kutúz"
"ov pondered, app"
arently trying 
to recollect som
ething. Prince A
ndrew stepped fo
rward from among
 the suite and 
said in French: 
  “You told m
e to remind you 
of the officer D
"ólokhov, reduce"
d to the ranks 
in this regiment
.”  “Where
 is Dólokhov?�
� asked Kutúzov
".

Dólokhov, "
who had already 
changed into a s
oldier’s gray 
"greatcoat,
did "
not wait to be c
alled. The shape
ly figure of the
 fair-haired so
"ldier, with his "
"clear blue eyes,"
 stepped forward
" from the ranks,"
 went up to the
 commander in ch
"ief, and present"
ed arms.  “H
ave you a compla
int to make?” 
Kutúzov asked w
ith a slight fro
wn.  “This i
"s Dólokhov,” "
said Prince Andr
ew.  “Ah!”
 said Kutúzov. 
“I hope this w
ill be a lesson 
to you. Do your 
 duty. The Emper
"or is gracious, "
and I shan’t f
orget you if you
 deserve well.�
��  The clear 
blue eyes looked
 at the commande
r in chief just 
as boldly as th
ey had looked at
 the regimental 
"commander, seemi"
ng by their expr
ession to tear 
open the veil of
 convention that
 separates a com
mander in chief 
 so widely from 
a private.  �
�One thing I ask
 of your excelle
"ncy,” Dólokho"
v said in his fi
"rm,
ringing, de"
liberate voice. 
“I ask an oppo
rtunity to atone
 for my fault a
nd prove my devo
tion to His Maje
sty the Emperor 
and to Russia!�
�  Kutúzov tu
rned away. The s
ame smile of the
 eyes with which
 he had turned 
from Captain Tim
ókhin again fli
tted over his fa
ce. He turned a
way with a grima
ce as if to say 
that everything 
Dólokhov had sa
id to him and e
verything he cou
ld say had long 
been known to hi
"m, that he was
"
weary of it and 
it was not at al
l what he wanted
. He turned away
 and went to th
e carriage.  T
he regiment brok
e up into compan
"ies, which went "
to their appoint
ed quarters nea
"r Braunau, where"
 they hoped to r
eceive boots and
 clothes and to
 rest after thei
r hard marches. 
  “You won’
t bear me a grud
"ge, Prokhór Ign"
átych?” said 
the regimental 
"commander, overt"
aking the third 
company on its w
ay to its quart
ers and riding u
p to Captain Tim
ókhin who was w
alking in front.
 (The regimenta
l commander’s 
face now that th
e inspection was
 happily over b
eamed with irrep
ressible delight
.) “It’s in 
the Emperor’s 
 service... it c
an’t be helped
... one is somet
imes a bit hasty
 on parade... I
 am the first to
" apologize, you "
know me!... He w
as very pleased
!” And he held
 out his hand to
 the captain.  
 “Don’t ment
"ion it, General,"
 as if I’d be 
so bold!” repl
ied the captain
", his nose growi"
ng redder as he 
gave a smile whi
ch showed where 
 two front teeth
 were missing th
at had been knoc
ked out by the b
utt end of a gu

“And tell Mr. 
Dólokhov that I
 won’t forget 
him—he may be 
quite easy. And
" tell me, please"
—I’ve been m
eaning to ask—
how is he behav
"ing himself, and"
 in general...�
�  “As far a
s the service go
es he is quite p
"unctilious, your"
 excellency; bu
t his character.
..” said Timó
khin.  “And 
what about his c
haracter?” ask
ed the regimenta
l commander.  
“It’s differ
ent on different
" days,” answer"
ed the captain. 
“One day he i
"s sensible, well"
" educated, and g"
"ood-natured, and"
 the next he’s
 a wild beast..
".. In Poland, if"
" you please, he "
nearly killed a 
Jew.”  “Oh

 remarked the re
gimental command
"er. “Still, on"
e must have pit

 in misfortune. 
You know he has 
important conne

"then, you just.."
.”  “I wil

"cy,” said Tim�"
"�khin, showing b"
y his smile that
 he understood 
his commander’
s wish.  “We
"ll, of course, o"
f course!”  
The regimental c
ommander sought 
out Dólokhov in
" the ranks and, "
reining in his 
"horse, said to h"
im:  “After 
the next affair.
.. epaulettes.�
�  Dólokhov l
ooked round but 
did not say anyt
"hing, nor did th"
e mocking smile
 on his lips cha
"nge.

“Well,"
 that’s all ri
"ght,” continue"
d the regimental
 commander. “A
 cup of vodka f
or the men from 
"me,” he added "
so that the sold
iers could hear
. “I thank you
 all! God be pra

rode past that

took the next on

“Well, h"
e’s really a g

Ti"
mókhin to the s
ubaltern beside 
him.  “In a 
"word, a hearty o"
ne...” said th
"e subaltern, lau"
ghing (the regi
mental commander
 was nicknamed K
ing of Hearts). 
  The cheerful 
mood of their of
ficers after the
 inspection infe
cted the soldie
rs. The company 
marched on gaily
. The soldiers�

e heard on ever

 “And so he is

"�

“No, frie"

"
“I say, Féde"

  “Buonapart

 “Singers to

e the captain’
s order.  And 
from the differe

enty men ran to 
the front. A dr
"ummer, their lea"

"shing

began a long-dra

nd concluding: �
"��On

 as if flinging

handsome soldie
r of forty—loo
ked sternly at t

crewed up his e
yes. Then having
 satisfied himse
lf that all eyes
 were fixed on h

he raised b"

arefully lifting
 some invisible

enly flung it d

"
“Oh, my bowe"

“Oh,"

"wenty voices, an"
d the castanet

 rushed out to t

shoulders and f
lourished his ca

reatening someon

 swinging their
 arms and keepin

"usly, marched wi"
th long steps. 
Behind the compa
ny the sound of 
"wheels, the crea"
"king of springs,"
 and the tramp 
of horses’ hoo
fs were heard. K
utúzov and his 
suite were retu
rning to the tow
n. The commander
 in chief made a
 sign that the 
men should conti

"ease, and he and"
 all his suite s
howed pleasure 
at the sound of 
the singing and 
the sight of the
 dancing soldie

d smartly marchi
ng men. In the s
econd file from
 the right flank
", beside which t"
he carriage pass
"ed the company,"
 a blue-eyed sol
dier involuntari
ly attracted not
ice. It was Dól

with particular 
grace and boldne
ss in time to th
e song and look
ing at those dri
ving past as if 
he pitied all wh
o were not at th

 cornet of Kutú
zov’s suite w
ho had mimicked 
the regimental c
"ommander, fell b"
ack from the ca

up to Dólokhov.
  Hussar corne
t Zherkóv had a
"t one time, in P"

had met Dólokho

to the gentleman
" ranker, he addr"
essed him with t

 an old friend.
  “My dear f

?” Dólokhov a
nswered coldly. 
“I am as you s
ee.”  The li
vely song gave a
 special flavor 
to the tone of f
ree and easy ga
iety with which 
"Zherkóv spoke, "
and to the inten
tional coldness 
of Dólokhov’
s reply.  “A
nd how do you ge
t on with the of
ficers?” inqui
red Zherkóv.  
 “All right. T
hey are good fel

onto the staff?

  “She let t

voluntary sensat

 Their conversa

the effect of t

Is it true that

sked Dólokhov. 
  “The devil

 say so.”  �
"��I’m glad,”"
 answered Dólok
hov briefly and 
"clearly, as the "
song demanded. 
"

“I say, com"

  “Do come.�

“Well, "

 “Come if you

“It’s a long

 Zherkóv touch
ed his horse wit

pranced excitedl

     CHAPTE
R III  On retu
rning from the r
"eview, Kutúzov "
took the Austria
n general into 
his private room
" and, calling hi"
"s adjutant, aske"
d for some paper
s relating to t
he condition of 
the troops on th
"eir arrival, and"
 the letters th
at had come from
 the Archduke Fe
"rdinand, who was"
 in command of 
the advanced arm
y. Prince Andrew
 Bolkónski came
 into the room w
ith the require
d papers. Kutúz
ov and the Austr
ian member of th
e Hofkriegsrath 
 were sitting at
 the table on wh
ich a plan was s
pread out.  �
�Ah!...” said 
Kutúzov glancin
g at Bolkónski 
as if by this e
xclamation he wa
s asking the adj
"utant to wait, a"
nd he went on wi
th the conversa
tion in French. 
  “All I can 
"say, General,”"
 said he with a 
pleasant eleganc
e of expression
 and intonation 
that obliged one
 to listen to ea
ch deliberately
 spoken word. It
 was evident tha
t Kutúzov himse
lf listened wit
h pleasure to hi
s own voice. “
"All I can say, G"
"eneral, is that "
if the matter d
epended on my pe
"rsonal wishes, t"
he will of His M
ajesty the Empe
ror Francis woul
d have been fulf
illed long ago. 
I should long a
go have joined t
he archduke. And
 believe me on m
y honour that to
 me personally 
it would be a pl
easure to hand o
ver the supreme 
command of the 
army into the ha
nds of a better 
informed and mor
e skillful gene
ral—of whom Au
stria has so man
y—and to lay d
own all this hea
vy responsibili
ty. But circumst
ances are someti
mes too strong f
"or us,
General."
”  And Kutú
zov smiled in a 
way that seemed 
"to say, “You a"
re quite at lib
erty not to beli
eve me and I don
’t even care w
hether you do or
"
not, but you h"
ave no grounds f
or telling me so
. And that is th
e whole point.�
��  The Austri
an general looke
"d dissatisfied, "
but had no optio
n but to reply 
in the same tone
.  “On the c
"ontrary,” he s"
"aid, in a querul"
ous and angry to
ne that contras
ted with his fla
"ttering words, �"
��on the contrar
"y, your
excelle"
ncy’s particip
ation in the com
mon action is hi
ghly valued by 
His Majesty; but
 we think the pr
esent delay is d
epriving the spl
endid Russian t
roops and their 
commander of the
 laurels they ha
ve been accusto
med to win in th
"eir battles,” "
he concluded his
 evidently prea
rranged sentence
.  Kutúzov bo
wed with the sam
e smile.  “B
ut that is my co
"nviction, and ju"
dging by the las
t letter with wh
ich His Highnes
s the Archduke F
erdinand has hon
"ored me, I imagi"
ne that the Aus
"trian troops, un"
der the directio
n of so skillful
 a leader as Gen
"eral
Mack, have"
 by now already 
gained a decisiv
e victory and no
 longer need ou
"r aid,” said K"
utúzov.  The 
general frowned.
 Though there wa
s no definite ne
ws of an Austria
"n
defeat, there"
 were many circu
mstances confirm
ing the unfavora
ble rumors that
" were afloat, an"
d so Kutúzov’
s suggestion of 
an Austrian vict
ory sounded muc
h like irony. Bu
t Kutúzov went 
on blandly smili
ng with the sam
"e expression, wh"
ich seemed to sa
y that he had a 
right to suppose
"
so. And, in fa"
"ct, the last let"
ter he had recei
ved from Mack’
s army informed
 him of a victor
y and stated str
ategically the p
osition of the 
army was very fa
vorable.  “G
ive me that lett
"er,” said Kut�"
�zov turning to 
Prince Andrew. 
“Please have a
 look at it”�
�and Kutúzov wi
th an ironical s
mile about the 
corners of his m
outh read to the
 Austrian genera
l the following
" passage, in Ger"
"man, from the Ar"
chduke Ferdinand
’s letter:  
We have fully co
ncentrated force
s of nearly seve
nty thousand men
 with which to 
attack and defea
t the enemy shou
ld he cross the 
"Lech. Also,
as "
we are masters o
"f Ulm, we cannot"
 be deprived of 
the advantage of
 commanding bot
h sides of the D
"anube, so that s"
hould the enemy 
not cross the L
"ech, we can cros"
"s the Danube, th"
row ourselves on
 his line of co
"mmunications, re"
cross the river 
"lower down, and "
frustrate his i
ntention should 
he try to direct
 his whole force
 against our fai
thful ally. We 
shall therefore 
confidently awai
t the moment whe
n the Imperial 
Russian army wil
l be fully equip
"ped, and shall t"
"hen, in conjunct"
"ion with
it, ea"
sily find a way 
to prepare for t
he enemy the fat
e he deserves. 
 Kutúzov sighe
d deeply on fini
shing this parag
raph and looked 
at the member o
f the Hofkriegsr
ath mildly and a
ttentively.  �
��But you know t
he wise maxim yo
"ur excellency, a"
dvising one to e
xpect the worst
",” said the Au"
"strian general, "
evidently wishin
g to have done 
with jests and t
o come to busine
ss. He involunta
rily looked roun
d at the aide-d
e-camp.  “Ex
"cuse me, General"
",” interrupted"
" Kutúzov, also "
turning to Princ
e Andrew. “Lo
"ok here, my dear"
" fellow, get fro"
m Kozlóvski all
 the reports fr
om our scouts. H
ere are two lett
ers from Count N
ostitz and here
 is one from His
 Highness the Ar
chduke Ferdinand
 and here are t
"hese,” he said"
", handing him se"
"veral papers, �"
�make a neat mem
orandum in Fren
ch out of all th
"is, showing all "
the news we have
 had of the mov
ements of the Au
"strian army, and"
 then give it to
 his excellency.
”  Prince An
drew bowed his h
ead in token of 
having understoo
d from the firs
t not only what 
had been said bu
t also what Kut�
�zov would have 
 liked to tell h
im. He gathered 
up the papers an
d with a bow to 
"both,
stepped s"
oftly over the c
arpet and went o
ut into the wait
ing room.  Tho
ugh not much tim
e had passed sin
ce Prince Andrew
 had left Russia
", he
had change"
d greatly during
 that period. In
 the expression 
"of his face,
in"
" his movements, "
"in his walk, sca"
rcely a trace wa
s left of his fo
rmer affected l
anguor and indol
ence. He now loo
ked like a man w
ho has time to 
think of the imp
ression he makes
" on others, but "
is occupied with
 agreeable and 
interesting work
. His face expre
ssed more satisf
action with him
self and those a
"round him, his s"
mile and glance 
were brighter a
nd more attracti
"ve.

Kutúzov,"
 whom he had ove
rtaken in Poland
", had received h"
"im very kindly,"
 promised not to
" forget him, dis"
tinguished him a
bove the other a
"djutants,
and h"
ad taken him to 
Vienna and given
 him the more se
rious commission
s. From Vienna 
Kutúzov wrote t
o his old comrad
"e, Prince Andrew"
’s father.  
Your son bids fa
ir to become an 
officer distingu
ished by his ind
"ustry,
firmness"
", and expedition"
. I consider mys
elf fortunate to
 have such a su
bordinate by me.
  On Kutúzov�
"��s staff, among"
 his fellow offi
cers and in the 
"army
generally,"
 Prince Andrew h
"ad, as he had ha"
d in Petersburg 
"society, two
qu"
ite opposite rep
"utations. Some, "
"a minority, ackn"
owledged him to 
be different fr
om themselves an
d from everyone 
"else, expected g"
reat things of 
"him, listened to"
" him, admired, a"
"nd imitated him,"
 and with them P
rince Andrew wa
s natural and pl
"easant. Others, "
"the majority, di"
sliked him and 
considered him c
"onceited, cold, "
and disagreeable
. But among thes
e people Prince
 Andrew knew how
 to take his sta
nd so that they 
respected and ev
en feared him. 
  Coming out of
 Kutúzov’s ro
om into the wait
ing room with th
e papers in his
 hand Prince And
rew came up to h
"is comrade, the "
aide-de-camp on 
"duty,
Kozlóvsk"
"i, who was sitti"
ng at the window
 with a book.  
"
“Well, Prince"
?” asked Kozl�
�vski.  “I a
m ordered to wri
te a memorandum 
explaining why w
e are not advan
cing.”  “A
nd why is it?”
  Prince Andre
w shrugged his s
houlders.  “
Any news from Ma
ck?”  “No.
”  “If it 
were true that h
e has been beate
"n, news would ha"
ve come.”  �
"��Probably,” s"
aid Prince Andre
w moving toward 
the outer door. 
  But at that i
nstant a tall Au
strian general i
"n a greatcoat, w"
ith the order o
f Maria Theresa 
on his neck and 
a black bandage 
"round his head,"
 who had evident
"ly just arrived,"
 entered quickly
", slamming the d"
oor. Prince And
rew stopped shor
t.  “Command
er in Chief Kut�
�zov?” said th
e newly arrived 
general speakin
g quickly with a
 harsh German ac
"cent, looking to"
 both sides and 
 advancing strai
ght toward the i
nner door.  �
�The commander i
n chief is engag
"ed,” said Kozl"
"óvski, going
h"
urriedly up to t
he unknown gener
al and blocking 
his way to the d
oor. “Whom sh
all I announce?�
��  The unknow
n general looked
 disdainfully do
wn at Kozlóvski
", who was
rathe"
"r short, as if s"
urprised that an
yone should not 
know him.  “
The commander in
 chief is engage
"d,” repeated K"
ozlóvski calmly
.  The general
’s face cloude
"d, his lips quiv"
ered and tremble
d. He took out 
"a notebook, hurr"
iedly scribbled 
something in pen
"cil, tore out th"
"e
leaf, gave it"
" to Kozlóvski, "
stepped quickly 
"to the window, a"
nd threw himsel
"f into a chair, "
gazing at those 
in the room as i
"f asking, “Why"
 do they look a
t me?” Then he
 lifted his head
", stretched his "
neck as if he i
ntended to say s
"omething, but im"
"mediately, with "
affected indiff
"erence, began to"
" hum to himself,"
 producing a que
er sound which 
immediately brok
e off. The door 
of the private r
oom opened and K
utúzov appeare
d in the doorway
. The general wi
th the bandaged 
head bent forwar
d as though run
ning away from s
"ome danger, and,"
" making long, qu"
ick strides wit
"h his thin legs,"
 went up to Kut�
�zov.  “Vous
 voyez le malheu
"reux Mack,” he"
 uttered in a br
oken voice.  K
utúzov’s face
 as he stood in 
the open doorway
 remained perfec
tly immobile fo
r a few moments.
 Then wrinkles r
an over his face
 like a wave an
d his forehead b
ecame smooth aga
"in, he bowed his"
 head respectful
"ly,
closed his "
"eyes, silently l"
et Mack enter hi
s room before hi
"m, and closed
t"
he door himself 
behind him.  T
he report which 
had been circula
ted that the Aus
trians had been 
beaten and that
 the whole army 
had surrendered 
at Ulm proved to
 be correct. Wi
thin half an hou
r adjutants had 
been sent in var
ious directions 
with orders whi
ch showed that t
he Russian troop
"s, who had hithe"
rto been inacti
"ve, would also s"
oon have to meet
 the enemy.  P
rince Andrew was
 one of those ra
re staff officer
s whose chief in
terest lay in t
he general progr
ess of the war. 
When he saw Mack
 and heard the 
details of his d
isaster he under
stood that half 
the campaign was
" lost,
understo"
od all the diffi
culties of the R
ussian army’s 
"position, and
v"
ividly imagined 
what awaited it 
and the part he 
would have to p
lay. Involuntari
ly he felt a joy
ful agitation at
 the thought of 
the humiliation
 of arrogant Aus
tria and that in
 a week’s time
" he might,
perh"
"aps, see and tak"
e part in the fi
rst Russian enco
unter with the 
French since Suv
órov met them. 
He feared that B
onaparte’s gen
ius might outwe
igh all the cour
age of the Russi
"an troops, and a"
t the same time
 could not admit
 the idea of his
 hero being disg
raced.  Excite
d and irritated 
by these thought
s Prince Andrew 
went toward his 
 room to write t
"o his father, to"
 whom he wrote e
very day. In the
 corridor he me
"t Nesvítski, wi"
th whom he share
"d a room, and th"
e wag Zherkóv; 
 they were as us
ual laughing.  
 “Why are you 
so glum?” aske
d Nesvítski not
icing Prince And
rew’s pale fa
ce and glitterin
g eyes.  “Th
ere’s nothing 
"to be gay about,"
” answered Bol
kónski.  Just
 as Prince Andre
w met Nesvítski
" and Zherkóv, t"
here came toward
 them from the 
other end of the
" corridor, Strau"
"ch, an Austrian "
general who was
 on Kutúzov’s
 staff in charge
 of the provisio
ning of the Russ
"ian
army, and t"
he member of the
 Hofkriegsrath w
ho had arrived t
he previous eve
ning. There was 
room enough in t
he wide corridor
 for the general
s to pass the t
hree officers qu
"ite easily, but "
"Zherkóv, pushin"
g Nesvítski as
ide with his arm
", said in a brea"
"thless voice,
"
 “They’re co
ming!... they’
re coming!... St
"and aside, make "
"way,
please mak"
e way!”  The
 generals were p
"assing by, looki"
ng as if they wi
shed to avoid e
mbarrassing atte
ntions. On the f
ace of the wag Z
herkóv there su
ddenly appeared
 a stupid smile 
of glee which he
 seemed unable t
o suppress.  �
��Your excellenc
"y,” said he in"
" German, steppin"
g forward and a
ddressing the Au
"strian general, "
“I have the ho
nor to congratul
ate you.”  
He bowed his hea
d and scraped fi
rst with one foo
t and then with 
"the
other, awkw"
"ardly, like a ch"
ild at a dancing
 lesson.  The 
member of the Ho
fkriegsrath look
ed at him severe
"ly but, seeing t"
he seriousness 
of his stupid sm
"ile, could not b"
ut give him a mo
ment’s attent
ion. He screwed 
up his eyes show
ing that he was 
listening.  �
�I have the hono
r to congratulat
e you. General M
"ack has arrived,"
" quite
well, on"
ly a little brui
"sed just here,�"
"� he added, poin"
ting with a bea
ming smile to hi
s head.  The g
"eneral frowned, "
"turned away, and"
 went on.  “
"Gott, wie naiv!�"
�� * said he ang
"rily, after he h"
ad gone a few st
eps.       * �
"��Good God, what"
 simplicity!” 
   Nesvítski 
with a laugh thr
ew his arms roun
"d Prince Andrew,"
 but Bolkónski
", turning still "
"paler, pushed hi"
m away with an a
ngry look and t
urned to Zherkó
v. The nervous i
rritation arouse
d by the appeara
"nce
of Mack, th"
e news of his de
"feat, and the th"
ought of what la
y before the Ru
ssian army found
 vent in anger a
t Zherkóv’s u
ntimely jest.  
"
“If you, sir,"
 choose to make 
a buffoon of you
"rself,” he sai"
"d
sharply, with"
 a slight trembl
ing of the lower
" jaw, “I can�"
�t prevent your
 doing so; but I
 warn you that i
f you dare to pl
ay the fool in m
"y
presence, I w"
ill teach you to
 behave yourself
.”  Nesvíts
ki and Zherkóv 
were so surprise
d by this outbur
st that they ga
zed at Bolkónsk
i silently with 
wide-open eyes. 
  “What’s t
he matter? I onl
y congratulated 
"them,” said Zh"
erkóv.  “I 
am not jesting w
ith you; please 
be silent!” cr
"ied Bolkónski,"
 and taking Nesv
ítski’s arm h
"e left Zherkóv,"
 who did not kno
w what to say. 
"

“Come, what"
"’s the matter,"
 old fellow?” 
said Nesvítski 
trying to sooth
e him.  “Wha
t’s the matter
?” exclaimed P
rince Andrew sta
nding still in 
his excitement. 
“Don’t you u

 over the news 
of Mack’s defe

"
had not yet come
 home when Rost�

ly in the mornin
g from a foragi

ostóv in his ca

h a jerk to his 
"
horse, rode up "
"to the porch, sw"
ung his leg over
 the saddle with
 a supple youth
"ful movement, st"
ood for a moment
 in the stirrup 
as if loathe to 
 part from his h
"orse, and at las"
t sprang down an
d called to his 
orderly.  “A

dear friend!” 
said he to the h
ussar who rushed
 up headlong to
 the horse. “W

cont"

 gay brotherly c

"

“Yes, your "

"

“Mind, walk"
 him up and down
 well!”  Ano
ther hussar also
 rushed toward t

ndarénko had al
ready thrown th

 to serve him. 
Rostóv patted t

! What a horse h

 thought with a 
"smile, and

ostóv waved his

 with Denísov. 
  “What about

 he asked Lavrú
"shka, Denísov�"
"�s orderly,
who"

"

“Yes, brin"

n minutes later 
Lavrúshka broug
ht the coffee. �
��He’s coming!
” said he. �
�Now for trouble
!” Rostóv loo
ked out of the w
indow and saw D
enísov coming h
ome. Denísov wa
s a small man wi
"th a red face,
"
sparkling black 
"eyes, and black "
tousled mustache
 and hair. He wo
re an unfastene
"d cloak, wide br"
eeches hanging d
"own in creases, "
and a crumpled 
shako on the bac
k of his head. H
e came up to the
" porch gloomily,"
 hanging his he

ed loudly and an
"grily, “take i"
"t off,
blockhea"
d!”  “Well
", I am taking it"
" off,” replied"
 Lavrúshka’s 
"voice.

“Ah,"
 you’re up alr
"eady,” said De"
"nísov, entering"
 the room.  �
"�Long ago,” an"
"swered Rostóv, "
“I have alread
y been for the h

and have se"
en Fräulein Mat

Weally! And I’
"ve been losing, "
bwother. I lost 
yesterday like a
 damned fool!�
� cried Denísov
", not pronouncin"
g his r’s. “
Such ill luck! 
Such ill luck. A
s soon as you le
"ft, it began and"
 went on. Hullo 
 there! Tea!” 
  Puckering up 
his face though 
"smiling, and sho"
wing his short s
"trong
teeth, he"
 began with stub
by fingers of bo
th hands to ruff
le up his thick 
 tangled black h
air.  “And w
hat devil made m

?” (an officer
 nicknamed “t
he rat”) he sa
"id, rubbing his "
forehead and who
le face with bot
h hands. “Jus
"t fancy, he didn"
’t let me win 
"a single cahd, n"
ot one cahd.”
  He took the 
lighted pipe tha
t was offered to
" him, gripped it"
" in his

nd tapped it on 
"the floor, makin"
g the sparks fly

cont"
inued to shout. 
  “He lets on

e scattered the

away. Then he r
emained silent f
"or a while, and "
all at once look
ed cheerfully w

t Rostóv.  �
�If at least we 
had some women h

�s nothing foh o
ne to do but dw

 only get to fig
hting soon. Hull
"o, who’s
ther"
"e?” he said, t"
urning to the do
or as he heard a
 tread of heavy 
 boots and the c
linking of spurs
 that came to a 
"stop, and a resp"
ectful cough. 
 “The squadro
n quartermaster!
” said Lavrús
hka.  Denísov
’s face pucker
ed still more. 
 “Wetched!”
" he muttered, th"
rowing down a pu
rse with some go
ld in it. “Wo
"stóv, deah fell"
"ow, just see how"
 much there is l
eft and shove th
e purse undah t
"he pillow,” he"
" said, and went "
out to the quart
ermaster.  Ros
tóv took the mo
"ney and, mechani"
cally arranging 
the old and new 
coins in separa
"te piles, began "
counting them. 
 “Ah! Telyán
in! How d’ye d
o? They plucked 
"me last night,�"
� came Denísov
’s voice from 
the next room. 
 “Where? At B
"ykov’s, at the"
 rat’s... I kn
"ew it,” replie"
d a piping voic
"e, and Lieutenan"
"t Telyánin, a s"
mall officer of 
the same squadro
"n,
entered the "
room.  Rostóv
 thrust the purs
e under the pill
ow and shook the
 damp little han
d which was off
ered him. Telyá
nin for some rea
son had been tra
nsferred from t
he Guards just b
efore this campa
ign. He behaved 
very well in the
 regiment but w
as not liked; Ro
stóv especially
 detested him an
d was unable to
 overcome or con
ceal his groundl
ess antipathy to
 the man.  “
"Well, young cava"
"lryman, how is m"
y Rook behaving?
” he asked. (R
ook was a young
 horse Telyánin
 had sold to Ros
tóv.)  The li
eutenant never l
ooked the man he
 was speaking to
 straight in the
 face; his eyes
 continually wan
dered from one o
bject to another
.  “I saw yo
u riding this mo
rning...” he a
"dded.

“Oh, "
he’s all right
", a good horse,�"
�� answered Rost
"óv, though the"
 horse for which
 he had paid sev
en hundred rubbl
es was not worth
 half that sum.
 “He’s begun
 to go a little 
lame on the left
" foreleg,” he"
 added.  “Th
e hoof’s crack
ed! That’s not
hing. I’ll tea
ch you what to d
o and show you 
what kind of riv
et to use.”  
"
“Yes, please "
"do,” said Rost"
óv.  “I’l
"l show you, I’"
ll show you! It�
��s not a secret
. And it’s a 
horse you’ll t
hank me for.” 
  “Then I’l
l have it brough
"t round,” said"
 Rostóv wishing
 to avoid Tely�
"�nin, and he wen"
t out to give th
e order.  In t
he passage Dení
"sov, with a pipe"
", was squatting "
on the threshold
 facing the qua
rtermaster who w
as reporting to 
him. On seeing R
"ostóv,
Deníso"
v screwed up his
 face and pointi
ng over his shou
lder with his t
humb to the room
 where Telyánin
" was sitting, he"
 frowned and gav
e a shudder of 
disgust.  “U
gh! I don’t li
"ke that fellow,�"
"�� he said, rega"
rdless of the q
uartermaster’s
 presence.  Ro
stóv shrugged h
is shoulders as 
much as to say: 
"“Nor do I, but"
 what’s one t
"o do?” and, ha"
ving given his o
"rder, he returne"
d to Telyánin.
  Telyánin wa
s sitting in the
 same indolent p
ose in which Ros
tóv had left h
"im, rubbing his "
small white hand
s.  “Well th
ere certainly ar
e disgusting peo
"ple,” thought "
Rostóv as he e
ntered.  “Ha
ve you told them
 to bring the ho
rse?” asked Te
"lyánin, getting"
 up and looking
 carelessly abou
t him.  “I h
ave.”  “Le
t us go ourselve
s. I only came r
ound to ask Den�
�sov about yest
erday’s order.
 Have you got it

"
 “Not yet. Bu
t where are you 
off to?”  �
�I want to teach
 this young man 
how to shoe a ho
"rse,” said
Te"
lyánin.  They
 went through th
e porch and into
 the stable. The
 lieutenant exp
lained how to ri
vet the hoof and
 went away to hi
s own quarters. 
  When Rostóv 
went back there 
was a bottle of 
vodka and a saus
age on the tabl
e. Denísov was 
sitting there sc
ratching with hi
s pen on a sheet
 of paper. He l
ooked gloomily i
n Rostóv’s fa
ce and said: “
I am witing to 
her.”  He le
aned his elbows 
on the table wit
h his pen in his
" hand and,
evid"
ently glad of a 
chance to say qu
icker in words w
hat he wanted to
"
write, told Ro"
stóv the conten

“You see,"

�Wetched busines

d to himself. �
�How much is lef

"” he asked, tu"

“Oh, it’s w"

“No, I"

 And Denísov we
nt to the bed to
 get the purse f

"t, Wostóv?”
"
 “Under the l

  “It’s not

nísov threw bot
h pillows on the
 floor. The purs
e was not there.
  “That’s 
a miwacle.”  
"
“Wait, haven�"
��t you dropped 
it?” said Rost
"óv, picking up "
the pillows one
 at a time and s
haking them.  
He pulled off th
e quilt and shoo
k it. The purse 
was not there. 
"
“Dear me, ca"
n I have forgott

er thinking that

der your head li

“I put it just

 it?” he asked
", turning to Lav"
rúshka.  “I
 haven’t been

must be where yo

“But it isn’

"��

“No, if "
I hadn’t thoug

“"
but I remember p
utting it there.
”  Lavrúshk
a turned all the
" bedding over, l"
ooked under the 
bed and under t
"he table, search"
"ed everywhere, a"
nd stood still i
n the middle of 
the room. Dení
sov silently wat

“Wostóv,"

y dropped them a

 not draw breat
h.  “And the

vrúshka.  “
"Now then, you de"

shouted Denísov

ushing at the ma

ening gesture. �
��If the purse i

"
on his saber, "
and put on his c
ap.  “I must

 shouted Deníso
"v, shaking his
"

houlders and kno
cking him agains
t the wall.  �
"��Denísov, let "
"him alone, I kno"

"óv,
going towa"

out raising his 
eyes. Denísov p
"aused, thought
"
"a moment, and, e"
vidently underst
anding what Rost
"óv hinted at, s"
eized his arm. 
  “Nonsense!�
"�� he cried, and"
 the veins on hi
s forehead and n
eck stood out l
ike cords. “Yo
"u are mad, I tel"
l you. I won’t
 allow it. The 
purse is here! I
’ll flay this 
"scoundwel alive,"
 and it will be 
 found.”  �
�I know who has 
"taken it,” rep"
eated Rostóv in
 an unsteady voi
"ce,
and went to"
 the door.  �
"�And I tell you,"
 don’t you dah
e to do it!” s
"houted Denísov,"
 rushing at the
 cadet to restra
in him.  But R
ostóv pulled aw
"ay his arm and, "
with as much ang
er as though De
nísov were his 
"worst enemy, fir"
mly fixed his ey
es directly on h
is face.  “
Do you understan
d what you’re 
saying?” he sa
id in a tremblin
g voice. “The
re was no one el
se in the room e
xcept myself. So
 that if it is 
"not so, then...�"
��  He could n
"ot finish, and r"
an out of the ro
"om.

“Ah, ma"
y the devil take
 you and evewybo
"dy,” were the "
last words Rost
óv heard.  Ro
stóv went to Te
lyánin’s quar
ters.  “The 
master is not in
", he’s gone to"
" headquarters,�"
� said Telyáni
n’s orderly. �
��Has something 
happened?” he 
"added, surprised"
 at the cadet�
�s troubled face
".

“No, noth"
ing.”  “Yo
u’ve only just
" missed him,” "
said the orderly
.  The headqua
rters were situa
ted two miles aw
ay from Salzenec
"k, and
Rostóv,"
 without returni
"ng home, took a "
horse and rode t
here. There was 
 an inn in the v
illage which the
 officers freque
nted. Rostóv ro
de up to it and
 saw Telyánin�
�s horse at the 
porch.  In the
 second room of 
the inn the lieu
tenant was sitti
ng over a dish o
f sausages and 
a bottle of wine
".

“Ah, you�"
��ve come here t
"oo, young man!�"
"� he said, smili"
ng and raising 
his eyebrows.  
"
“Yes,” said"
 Rostóv as if i
t cost him a gre
at deal to utter
 the word; and 
he sat down at t
he nearest table
.  Both were s
ilent. There wer
e two Germans an
d a Russian offi
cer in the room
. No one spoke a
nd the only soun
ds heard were th
e clatter of kni
ves and the mun
ching of the lie
utenant.  When
 Telyánin had f
inished his lunc
h he took out of
 his pocket a do
"uble
purse and,"
 drawing its rin
gs aside with hi
"s small, white, "
turned-up finge
"rs, drew out a g"
"old imperial, an"
d lifting his ey
ebrows gave it t
o the waiter. 
 “Please be q
"uick,” he said"
.  The coin wa
s a new one. Ros
tóv rose and we
nt up to Telyán
in.  “Allow 
me to look at yo
"ur purse,” he "
"said in a low, a"
lmost inaudible
", voice.

With"
 shifting eyes b
ut eyebrows stil
"l raised, Telyá"
nin handed him t
he purse.  �
"�Yes, it’s a n"
"ice purse. Yes, "
"yes,” he said,"
 growing suddenl
"y
pale, and add"
"ed, “Look at i"
"t, young man.”"
  Rostóv took
 the purse in hi
"s hand, examined"
 it and the mone
"y in it, and
lo"
oked at Telyáni
n. The lieutenan
t was looking ab
out in his usual
 way and sudden
ly seemed to gro
w very merry.  
 “If we get to
 Vienna I’ll g
et rid of it the
re but in these 
wretched little
 towns there’s
 nowhere to spen
"d it,” said he"
". “Well, let m"
"e
have it, youn"
"g man, I’m goi"
ng.”  Rostó
v did not speak.
  “And you? 
Are you going to
 have lunch too?
 They feed you q
uite decently h
"ere,” continue"
d Telyánin. “
"Now then, let me"
 have it.”  
He stretched out
 his hand to tak
e hold of the pu
rse. Rostóv let
 go of it. Tely
ánin took the p
urse and began c
arelessly slippi
ng it into the 
pocket of his ri
"ding breeches, w"
ith his eyebrows
 lifted and his 
mouth slightly 
"open, as if to s"
"ay, “Yes, yes,"
 I am putting my
 purse in my po
cket and that’
s quite simple a
nd is no one els
e’s business.�
"��

“Well, y"
oung man?” he 
said with a sigh
", and from under"
 his lifted bro
ws he glanced in
to Rostóv’s e
yes.  Some fla
sh as of an elec
tric spark shot 
from Telyánin�
�s eyes to Rost
óv’s and back
", and back again"
 and again in an
 instant.  “
"Come here,” sa"
"id Rostóv, catc"
hing hold of Tel
yánin’s arm a
nd almost dragg
ing him to the w
indow. “That m
oney is Denísov
’s; you took 
it...” he whis
pered just above
 Telyánin’s e
ar.  “What? 
What? How dare y
ou? What?” sai
d Telyánin.  
But these words 
came like a pite
"ous, despairing "
cry and an entre
aty for pardon.
 As soon as Rost
"óv heard them, "
an enormous load
 of doubt fell 
from him. He was
" glad, and at th"
e same instant b
egan to pity the
 miserable man 
who stood before
" him, but the ta"
sk he had begun 
had to be compl
eted.  “Heav
en only knows wh
at the people he
"re may imagine,�"
�� muttered Tel
"yánin, taking u"
p his cap and mo
ving toward a sm
all empty room. 
“We must have
 an explanation.
..”  “I kn
ow it and shall 
"prove it,” sai"
d Rostóv.  �
�I...”  Ever
y muscle of Tely
"ánin’s pale, "
terrified face b
"egan to quiver, "
his eyes still 
shifted from sid
e to side but wi
th a downward lo
ok not rising t
o Rostóv’s fa
"ce, and his sobs"
 were audible. 
 “Count!... D
on’t ruin a yo
ung fellow... he
re is this wretc
"hed money,
take"
 it...” He thr
ew it on the tab
le. “I have an
 old father and 
 mother!...” 
 Rostóv took t
"he money, avoidi"
ng Telyánin’s
" eyes, and went "
out of the room
 without a word.
 But at the door
 he stopped and 
then retraced hi
s steps. “O G
"od,” he said w"
ith tears in his
" eyes, “how co"
uld you do it?�
��  “Count..
.” said Telyá
nin drawing near
er to him.  �
�Don’t touch m
"e,” said Rost�"
"�v, drawing back"
. “If you need
" it,
take the m"
"oney,” and he "
threw the purse 
to him and ran o
ut of the inn. 
     CHAPTE
R V  That same
 evening there w
as an animated d
iscussion among 
the squadron’
s officers in De
nísov’s quart
ers.  “And I
" tell you, Rost�"
"�v, that you mus"
t apologize to t
he colonel!” 
"said a tall, gri"
zzly-haired staf
"f captain, with "
enormous mustach
es and many wri
nkles on his lar
"ge features, to "
Rostóv who was 
crimson with ex
citement.  The
" staff captain, "
"Kírsten, had tw"
ice been reduced
 to the ranks fo
r affairs of ho
nor and had twic
e regained his c
ommission.  �
�I will allow no
 one to call me 
a liar!” cried
 Rostóv. “He 
"told
me I lied,"
 and I told him 
he lied. And the
re it rests. He 
may keep me on 
"duty every day, "
or may place me 
"under arrest, bu"
t no one can mak
"e
me apologize,"
" because if he, "
as commander of 
"this regiment, t"
hinks it beneat
h his dignity to
 give me satisfa

�  “You just
" wait a moment, "
"my dear fellow, "
"and listen,” i"
nterrupted the 
staff captain in
" his deep bass, "
calmly stroking 
his long mustach
e. “You tell 
the colonel in t
he presence of o
ther officers th
at an officer h
as stolen...” 
  “I’m not 
to blame that th

 I ought not to 
have spoken befo

�  “That’s
 all right. No o
ne thinks you a

’s not the po

not out of the q

enísov sat gloo
mily biting his

tening to the c
"onversation, evi"
dently with no w

 in it. He answe
red the staff c
aptain’s quest
ion by a disappr
oving shake of h
is head.  “Y
ou speak to the

tinued the staff
" captain, “and"
 Bogdánich” (
the colonel was
 called Bogdáni

 up.”  “He
 did not shut me

"Well, have it so"
", and you talked"
 a lot of nonsen

st apologize.�
�  “Not on a

xclaimed Rostóv
.  “I did no
t expect this of

seriously and s
everely. “You 
don’t wish to 
"apologize, but, "
"man, it’s not "
only to him but
 to the whole re

. The case is t
his: you ought t
o have thought t
he matter over a
nd taken advice
"; but no, you go"
 and blurt it al
l straight out b
efore the offic

s the colonel to
 do? Have the of
ficer tried and 
 disgrace the wh
ole regiment? Di
sgrace the whole
 regiment becaus
e of one scound
rel? Is that how
 you look at it?
 We don’t see 
it like that. An
d Bogdánich wa
s a brick: he to

saying what was 
not true. It’
"s not pleasant, "
but what’s to 
"be done, my dear"
 fellow? You lan
ded yourself in
" it. And now, wh"
en one wants to 
smooth the thing
" over, some
con"
ceit prevents yo
"ur apologizing, "
and you wish to 
make the whole 
affair public. Y
ou are offended 
at being put on 
"duty a bit, but "
why not apologi
ze to an old and
 honorable offic
er? Whatever Bog
"dánich may
be,"
 anyway he is an
 honorable and b
rave old colonel
! You’re quick
 at taking offe
"nse, but you don"
’t mind disgra

�� But it’s n

 It’s not the

HAPTER VI  Kut
úzov fell back 
"toward Vienna, d"
estroying behind
 him the bridges
 over the river
s Inn (at Brauna
u) and Traun (ne
ar Linz). On Oct
ober 23 the Rus
sian troops were
 crossing the ri
ver Enns. At mid
day the Russian 
"
baggage train, "
"the artillery, a"
nd columns of tr
oops were defili
ng through the 
town of Enns on 
both sides of th
e bridge.  It 
"was a warm, rain"
"y, autumnal day."
 The wide expans
e that opened ou
t before the he
ights on which t
he Russian batte

ing the bridge 
was at times vei
led by a diaphan
ous curtain of s
"lanting rain, an"
"d
then, suddenl"
y spread out in

" Down below,

e little town co
uld be seen with
" its white, red-"
"roofed houses, i"
"ts
cathedral, a"
"nd its bridge, o"
n both sides of 
which streamed j
ostling masses 
of Russian troop
s. At the bend o
"f the Danube, ve"
"ssels, an island"
",
and a castle "
with a park surr
ounded by the wa

be became visibl
"e, and the rocky"
 left bank of th
e Danube covere
d with pine fore
"sts, with a myst"
ic background of
 green treetops
 and bluish gorg

of a convent sto
od out beyond a 
 wild virgin pin
"e forest, and fa"
r away on the ot
her side of the 
Enns the enemy�
��s horse patrol
s could be disce

he field guns on
 the brow of the
 hill the genera
l in command of 
 the rearguard s
tood with a staf
"f officer, scann"
ing the country 
through his fie
ldglass. A littl
e behind them Ne
"svítski, who ha"
d been sent to 
the rearguard by
 the commander i
"n chief, was sit"
ting on the trai
l of a gun carr
iage. A Cossack 
who accompanied 
him had handed h
im a knapsack a
"nd a flask, and "
Nesvítski was t
reating some off
icers to pies an
d real doppelk�
�mmel. The offic
ers gladly gathe
"red round him, s"
ome on their kn
"ees, some squatt"
ing Turkish fash
ion on the wet g
"rass.

“Yes,"
 the Austrian pr
ince who built t
hat castle was n
o fool. It’s 
a fine place! Wh
y are you not ea
"ting anything, g"
entlemen?” Nes
vítski was say
ing.  “Thank
" you very much, "
"Prince,” answe"
red one of the o
"fficers, pleased"
 to be talking 
to a staff offic
er of such impor
tance. “It’s
 a lovely place
! We passed clos
e to the park an
d saw two deer..
. and what a sp
lendid house!”
"

“Look, Pri"
"nce,” said ano"
"ther, who would "
have dearly like
d to take anoth
er pie but felt 
"shy, and therefo"
re pretended to 
be examining the
 countryside—
"“See, our infa"
ntrymen have alr
eady got there. 
Look there in t
he meadow behind
" the village, th"
ree of them are 
dragging somethi
ng. They’ll r
ansack that cast
"le,” he remark"
ed with evident 
approval.  “
"So they will,”"
 said Nesvítski
". “No, but wha"
"t I should like,"
"”
added he, m"
unching a pie in
 his moist-lippe
d handsome mouth
", “would be
t"
o slip in over t
here.”  He p
ointed with a sm
ile to a turrete
"d nunnery, and h"
is eyes narrowed
 and gleamed. 
 “That would 
"be fine, gentlem"
en!”  The of
ficers laughed. 
  “Just to fl
utter the nuns a
 bit. They say t
here are Italian
 girls among th
em. On my word I
’d give five y
ears of my life 
for it!”  �
�They must be fe
"eling dull, too,"
” said one of 
the bolder offic
"ers,
laughing."
  Meanwhile the
 staff officer s
tanding in front
 pointed out som
ething to the g
"eneral, who look"
ed through his f
ield glass.  �
"��Yes, so it is,"
" so it is,” sa"
id the general a
"ngrily, lowering"
 the field glas
s and shrugging 
"his shoulders, �"
��so it is! They
’ll be fired 
on at the crossi
ng. And why are 
they dawdling th
ere?”  On th
e opposite side 
the enemy could 
be seen by the n
"aked eye, and fr"
om their batter
y a milk-white c
loud arose. Then
 came the distan
t report of a s
"hot, and our tro"
ops could be see
n hurrying to th
e crossing.  N
"esvítski rose, "
"puffing, and wen"
t up to the gene
"ral, smiling.
"
 “Would not yo
ur excellency li
ke a little refr
eshment?” he s
aid.  “It’
s a bad business
",” said the ge"
neral without an
"swering him,
�"
�our men have be
en wasting time.
”  “Hadn�
�t I better ride
" over, your exce"
llency?” asked
 Nesvítski.  
"“Yes, please d"
"o,” answered t"
"he general, and "
he repeated the 
order that had 
already once bee
n given in detai
l: “and tell t
he hussars that
 they are to cro
ss last and to f
ire the bridge a
s I ordered; and
 the inflammabl
e material on th
e bridge must be
 reinspected.”
  “Very good
",” answered Ne"
svítski.  He 
called the Cossa
ck with his hors
"e, told him to p"
ut away the knap
"sack
and flask,"
 and swung his h
eavy person easi
ly into the sadd
le.  “I’ll
 really call in 
"on the nuns,” "
he said to the o
fficers who wat
ched him smiling
"ly, and he rode "
off by the windi
ng path down the
 hill.  “No
"w then, let’s "
see how far it w
"ill carry, Capta"
in. Just try!”
 said the gener
"al, turning to a"
n artillery offi
cer. “Have a l
ittle fun to pa
ss the time.” 
"

“Crew, to y"
our guns!” com
manded the offic
er.  In a mome
nt the men came 
running gaily fr
om their campfir
es and began lo
ading.  “One
!” came the co
mmand.  Number
 one jumped bris
kly aside. The g
un rang out with
 a deafening me
"tallic roar, and"
 a whistling gre
nade flew above 
the heads of our
 troops below t
he hill and fell
 far short of th
"e enemy, a littl"
e smoke showing
 the spot where 
it burst.  The
 faces of office
rs and men brigh
tened up at the 
sound. Everyone 
got up and bega
n watching the m
ovements of our 
"troops below, as"
 plainly visibl
e as if but a st
one’s throw aw
"ay, and the move"
ments of the ap
proaching enemy 
farther off. At 
the same instant
 the sun came fu
lly out from be
"hind the clouds,"
 and the clear s
ound of the soli
tary shot and t
he brilliance of
 the bright suns
hine merged in a
 single joyous a
nd spirited imp
ression.    
  CHAPTER VII 
  Two of the en
emy’s shots ha
d already flown 
across the bridg
"e, where
there "
was a crush. Hal
fway across stoo
d Prince Nesvít
"ski, who had
al"
ighted from his 
horse and whose 
big body was jam
med against the 
 railings. He lo
oked back laughi
ng to the Cossac
k who stood a fe
w steps behind 
him holding two 
horses by their 
bridles. Each ti
me Prince Nesv�
�tski tried to m
"ove on, soldiers"
 and carts pushe
d him back again
 and pressed hi
m against the ra
"ilings, and all "
he could do was 
to smile.  “
What a fine fell
"ow you are, frie"
nd!” said the 
Cossack to a con
voy soldier wit
"h a wagon, who w"
as pressing onto
 the infantrymen
 who were crowd
ed together clos
e to his wheels 
and his horses. 
“What a fellow
! You can’t w
ait a moment! Do
n’t you see th
e general wants 
to pass?”  B
ut the convoyman
 took no notice 
of the word “g
eneral” and sh
outed at the so
ldiers who were 
blocking his way
". “Hi there, b"
oys! Keep to th
e left! Wait a b
it.” But the s
"oldiers, crowded"
 together should
"er to
shoulder,"
 their bayonets 
"interlocking, mo"
ved over the bri
dge in a dense 
mass. Looking do
wn over the rail
s Prince Nesvít
ski saw the rapi
"d, noisy
little"
 waves of the En
"ns, which rippli"
ng and eddying r
ound the piles o
f the bridge ch
ased each other 
along. Looking o
n the bridge he 
saw equally uni
form living wave
"s of soldiers, s"
"houlder straps, "
"covered shakos,"
"
knapsacks, bayo"
"nets, long muske"
"ts, and, under t"
"he shakos, faces"
 with broad che
"ekbones, sunken "
"cheeks, and list"
less tired expre
"ssions, and
fee"
t that moved thr
ough the sticky 
mud that covered
 the planks of t
he bridge. Some
times through th
e monotonous wav
"es of men, like "
a fleck of whit
e foam on the wa
"ves of the Enns,"
" an officer, in "
a cloak and with
 a type of face
 different from 
"that of the men,"
 squeezed his wa
y along; someti
mes like a chip 
of wood whirling
" in the river, a"
n hussar on foot
",
an orderly, o"
r a townsman was
 carried through
 the waves of in
fantry; and som
etimes like a lo
g floating down 
"the river, an of"
ficers’ or co
mpany’s baggag
"e wagon, piled h"
"igh, leather cov"
"ered, and hemmed"
 in on all side
"s, moved across "
the bridge.  �
��It’s as if a
" dam had burst,�"
�� said the Coss
ack hopelessly. 
“Are there ma
ny more of you t
o come?”  �
�A million all b
ut one!” repli
ed a waggish sol
dier in a torn c
"oat,
with a win"
"k, and passed on"
 followed by ano
"ther, an old man"
.  “If he”
 (he meant the e
nemy) “begins 
popping at the b
"ridge now,”
s"
aid the old sold
ier dismally to 
"a comrade, “yo"
u’ll forget to
 scratch yourse
lf.”  That s
oldier passed on
", and after him "
came another sit
ting on a cart. 
  “Where the 
devil have the l
eg bands been sh
oved to?” said
" an
orderly, ru"
nning behind the
 cart and fumbli
ng in the back o
f it.  And he 
also passed on w
ith the wagon. T
hen came some me
rry soldiers who
 had evidently 
been drinking. 
"
“And then, o"
"ld fellow, he gi"
ves him one in t
he teeth with th
e butt end of h
is gun...” a s
oldier whose gre
atcoat was well 
tucked up said 
"gaily, with a wi"
de swing of his 
"arm.

“Yes, "
the ham was just
 delicious...”
 answered anothe
r with a loud l
"augh. And they, "
"too, passed on, "
so that Nesvíts
ki did not learn
 who had been s
truck on the tee
"th, or what the "
ham had to do wi
th it.  “Bah
! How they scurr
y. He just sends
 a ball and they
 think they’ll
"
all be killed,"
” a sergeant w
as saying angril
y and reproachfu
lly.  “As it
" flies past me, "
"Daddy, the ball "
"I mean,” said "
a young soldier 
 with an enormou
"s mouth, hardly "
refraining from 
"laughing, “I f"
elt like dying 
of fright. I did
", ‘pon my word"
", I got that fri"
ghtened!” said
"
he, as if brag"
ging of having b
een frightened. 
  That one also
 passed. Then fo
llowed a cart un
like any that ha
d gone before. 
It was a German 
cart with a pair
 of horses led b
"y a German, and"
 seemed loaded w
ith a whole hous
eful of effects.
 A fine brindled
 cow with a lar
ge udder was att
ached to the car
t behind. A woma
n with an unwean
"ed
baby, an old"
" woman, and a he"
althy German gir
l with bright re
d cheeks were s
itting on some f
eather beds. Evi
dently these fug
itives were all
owed to pass by 
special permissi
on. The eyes of 
all the soldiers
 turned toward 
"the women, and w"
hile the vehicle
 was passing at 
foot pace all t
he soldiers’ r
emarks related t
o the two young 
ones. Every face
 bore almost th
"e same smile, ex"
pressing unseeml
y thoughts about
 the women.  
"“Just see, the"
 German sausage 
is making tracks
", too!”

“"
Sell me the miss
"is,” said anot"
"her soldier, add"
ressing the Germ
"an,
who, angry "
"and frightened, "
strode energetic
ally along with 
downcast eyes. 
  “See how sm
art she’s made
" herself! Oh, th"
e devils!”  
"“There, Fedót"
"ov, you should b"
e quartered on t
hem!”  “I 
have seen as muc
"h before now, ma"
te!”  “Whe
re are you going
?” asked an in
fantry officer w
ho was eating an
"
apple, also ha"
lf smiling as he
 looked at the h
andsome girl.  
 The German clos
"ed his eyes, sig"
nifying that he 
did not understa
nd.  “Take i
"t if you like,�"
� said the offic
"er, giving the g"
irl an apple.  
 The girl smiled
 and took it. Ne
svítski like th
e rest of the me
n on the bridge
 did not take hi
s eyes off the w
omen till they h
ad passed. When 
 they had gone b
"y, the same stre"
am of soldiers f
"ollowed, with th"
e same kind of 
"talk, and at las"
t all stopped. A
"s often happens,"
 the horses of 
a convoy wagon b
ecame restive at
 the end of the 
"bridge, and the "
whole crowd had
 to wait.  “
And why are they
 stopping? There
’s no proper o
rder!” said th
e soldiers. “
Where are you sh
oving to? Devil 
take you! Can’
t you wait? It�
��ll be worse if
 he fires the br
"idge. See, here�"
��s an officer j
ammed in too”
—different voi
ces were saying 
"in the crowd, as"
 the men looked 
"
at one another,"
 and all pressed
 toward the exit
 from the bridge
.  Looking dow
n at the waters 
of the Enns unde
"r the bridge, Ne"
svítski sudden
ly heard a sound
" new to him, of "
something swiftl
y approaching...
"
something big,"
 that splashed i
nto the water. 
 “Just see wh
ere it carries t
o!” a soldier 
near by said ste
"rnly,
looking r"
ound at the soun
d.  “Encoura
ging us to get a
"long quicker,”"
 said another un
easily.  The c
rowd moved on ag
ain. Nesvítski 
realized that it
 was a cannon ba
"ll.

“Hey, C"
"ossack, my horse"
!” he said. �
"�Now, then, you "
there! get out 
of the way! Make
 way!”  With
 great difficult
y he managed to 
get to his horse
", and shouting
"
continually he m
oved on. The sol
diers squeezed t
hemselves to mak
"e way
for him, "
but again presse
d on him so that
 they jammed his
" leg, and those"
 nearest him wer
e not to blame f
or they were the
mselves pressed 
still harder fr
om behind.  �
"�Nesvítski, Nes"
vítski! you num

 hoarse voice fr

  Nesvítski lo
oked round and s
"aw, some fifteen"
 paces away but

  “Tell these

you?”  “Th

ted Váska Dení
"sov, showing his"
 white teeth fi
ercely and spurr

"oroughbred Arab,"
 which twitched
 its ears as the
 bayonets touche
"d it, and snorte"
"d, spurting
whi"
te foam from his
" bit, tramping t"
he planks of the
 bridge with his
"
hoofs, and app"
arently ready to
 jump over the r
ailings had his 
rider let him. 
“What is this?
 They’re like 
sheep! Just like
 sheep! Out of t

us pass!... Stop
" there, you devi"

 I’ll hack yo

"” he shouted, "
actually drawing
 his saber from 
its scabbard an
d flourishing it
.  The soldier
s crowded agains
t one another wi
th terrified fac

Deníso"
v joined Nesvít

ot drunk today?�
�� said Nesvíts
ki when the oth

 to him.  “T

ered Váska Den
ísov. “They k

is is.”  “
What a dandy you
 are today!” s
"aid Nesvítski, "
looking at Den�
�sov’s new clo
ak and saddleclo
th.  Denísov 
"smiled, took out"
 of his sabretac
he a handkerchie
f that diffused 
 a smell of perf
"ume, and put it "
to Nesvítski’
s nose.  “Of
 course. I’m g
oing into action
"! I’ve shaved,"
 bwushed my teet
"h,
and scented "
myself.”  Th
e imposing figur
e of Nesvítski 
followed by his 
"Cossack, and
th"
e determination 
of Denísov who 
flourished his s
word and shouted
"
frantically, h"
ad such an effec
t that they mana
ged to squeeze t
hrough to the f
arther side of t
he bridge and st
opped the infant
ry. Beside the 
bridge Nesvítsk
i found the colo
nel to whom he h
ad to deliver th
"e order,
and ha"
ving done this h
e rode back.  
Having cleared t
he way Denísov 
stopped at the e
nd of the bridge
. Carelessly ho
lding in his sta
llion that was n
eighing and pawi
"ng the
ground, "
eager to rejoin 
"its fellows, he "
watched his squa
dron draw neare
r. Then the clan
"g of hoofs, as o"
f several horses
" galloping,
res"
ounded on the pl
anks of the brid
"ge, and the squa"
"dron, officers i"
n front and men
" four abreast, s"
pread across the
 bridge and bega
n to emerge on 
his side of it. 
  The infantry 
who had been sto
pped crowded nea
r the bridge in 
the trampled mu
d and gazed with
 that particular
 feeling of ill-
"will,
estrangem"
"ent, and ridicul"
e with which tro
ops of different
 arms usually e
ncounter one ano
ther at the clea
"n, smart hussars"
 who moved past 
them in regular
 order.  “Sm
art lads! Only f
it for a fair!�
� said one.  �
��What good are 
they? They’re 
led about just f
or show!” rema
rked another. 
 “Don’t kic
"k up the dust, y"
ou infantry!” 
jested an hussar
 whose prancing
 horse had splas
hed mud over som
e foot soldiers.
  “I’d lik
e to put you on 
a two days’ ma

cords would soon
 get a bit rubbe

"fantryman, wipin"

" corporal, chaff"
ing a thin littl

 a stick between

’ll suit you f

the hussar shout
ed back.    
  CHAPTER VIII
  The last of 
the infantry hur
riedly crossed t
"he bridge, squee"
zing together a
s they approache
d it as if passi
ng through a fun
nel. At last th
e baggage wagons
 had all crossed
", the crush was "
"less, and the la"
st battalion ca
me onto the brid
ge. Only Deníso
v’s squadron o
f hussars remai
ned on the farth
er side of the b
ridge facing the
" enemy, who coul"
d be seen from 
the hill on the 
opposite bank bu
t was not yet vi
sible from the 
"bridge, for the "
horizon as seen 
from the valley 
through which th
e river flowed 
was formed by th
e rising ground 
only half a mile
 away. At the f
oot of the hill 
lay wasteland ov
er which a few g
roups of our Co
ssack scouts wer
e moving. Sudden
ly on the road a
t the top of the
" high
ground, a"
rtillery and tro
ops in blue unif
orm were seen. T
hese were the F
rench. A group o
f Cossack scouts
 retired down th
e hill at a trot
. All the offic
ers and men of D
enísov’s squa
"dron, though the"
y tried to talk 
 of other things
 and to look in 
other directions
", thought only o"
f what was ther
e on the hilltop
", and kept const"
antly looking at
 the patches ap
pearing on the s
"kyline, which th"
ey knew to be th
e enemy’s troo
ps. The weather
 had cleared aga
in since noon an
d the sun was de
scending bright
ly upon the Danu
be and the dark 
hills around it.
" It was calm, an"
d at intervals 
the bugle calls 
and the shouts o
f the enemy coul
d be heard from
 the hill. There
 was no one now 
between the squa
dron and the ene
my except a few
 scattered skirm
ishers. An empty
 space of some s
even hundred ya
rds was all that
 separated them.
 The enemy cease
"d firing, and th"
"at
stern, threa"
"tening, inaccess"
"ible, and intang"
ible line which 
separates two h
ostile armies wa
s all the more c
learly felt.  
“One step beyo
nd that boundary
 line which rese
mbles the line d
ividing the liv
ing from the dea
d lies uncertain
"ty, suffering, a"
nd death. And w
hat is there? Wh
o is there?—th
ere beyond that 
"field, that tree"
", that
roof lit"
 up by the sun? 
"No one knows, bu"
t one wants to k
now. You fear a
nd yet long to c
"ross that line, "
and know that so
oner or later it
 must be crosse
d and you will h
ave to find out 
"what is there, j"
ust as you will 
 inevitably have
 to learn what l
ies the other si
de of death. But
 you are strong
", healthy, cheer"
"ful, and excited"
", and are surrou"
nded by other su
ch excitedly an
imated and healt
hy men.” So th
"inks, or at any "
"rate
feels, any"
one who comes in
 sight of the en
"emy, and that fe"
eling gives a p
articular glamou
r and glad keenn
ess of impressio
n to everything 
that takes plac
e at such moment
s.  On the hig
h ground where t
"he enemy was, th"
e smoke of a can
"non rose,
and a"
 ball flew whist
ling over the he
ads of the hussa
r squadron. The 
 officers who ha
d been standing 
together rode of
f to their place
s. The hussars 
began carefully 
aligning their h
orses. Silence f
ell on the whole
 squadron. All 
were looking at 
the enemy in fro
nt and at the sq
uadron commande
"r, awaiting the "
word of command.
 A second and a 
third cannon ba
ll flew past. Ev
idently they wer
e firing at the 
"hussars, but the"
 balls with rap
id rhythmic whis
tle flew over th
e heads of the h
orsemen and fell
 somewhere beyo
nd them. The hus
sars did not loo
"k round, but at "
the sound of ea
"ch shot, as at t"
he word of comma
"nd, the whole sq"
uadron with its 
 rows of faces s
o alike yet so d
"ifferent, holdin"
g its breath whi
le the ball fle
"w past, rose in "
the stirrups and
 sank back again
. The soldiers 
without turning 
their heads glan
ced at one anoth
"er, curious to s"
ee their comrad
es’ impression
". Every face, fr"
om Denísov’s 
to that of the 
"bugler, showed o"
ne common expres
sion of conflict
", irritation, an"
"d
excitement, a"
round chin and m
outh. The quarte
"rmaster frowned,"
 looking at the
 soldiers as if 
threatening to p
unish them. Cade
t Mirónov ducke
d every time a 
ball flew past. 
Rostóv on the l
"eft flank, mount"
ed on his Rook�
��a handsome hor
se despite its g
ame leg—had th
e happy air of a
 schoolboy call
ed up before a l
arge audience fo
r an examination
 in which he fe
els sure he will
 distinguish him
self. He was gla
ncing at everyon
"e
with a clear,"
 bright expressi
"on, as if asking"
 them to notice 
how calmly he s
at under fire. B
ut despite himse
"lf, on his face "
too that same i
ndication of som
ething new and s
tern showed roun
d the mouth.  
“Who’s that 
curtseying there
? Cadet Miwónov
! That’s not w
ight! Look at m
"e,” cried Den�"
"�sov who, unable"
 to keep still o
"n one spot,
kep"
t turning his ho
rse in front of 
the squadron.  
"
The black, hair"
"y, snub-nosed fa"
ce of Váska Den
"ísov, and his w"
hole short stur
dy figure with t
he sinewy hairy 
hand and stumpy 
fingers in whic
h he held the hi
lt of his naked 
"saber, looked ju"
st as it usually
"
did, especiall"
y toward evening
 when he had emp
tied his second 
bottle; he was 
only redder than
 usual. With his
 shaggy head thr
own back like bi
rds when they d
"rink, pressing h"
is spurs mercile
ssly into the si
des of his good
" horse, Bedouin,"
 and sitting as 
though falling b
ackwards in the 
"
saddle, he gall"
oped to the othe
r flank of the s
quadron and shou
ted in a hoarse
 voice to the me
n to look to the
ir pistols. He r
ode up to Kírs
ten. The staff c
aptain on his br
"oad-backed, stea"
dy mare came at 
a walk to meet 
him. His face wi
th its long must
ache was serious
" as always,
onl"
y his eyes were 
brighter than us
"ual.

“Well,"
 what about it?�
�� said he to De
nísov. “It wo
n’t come to a 
 fight. You’ll
 see—we shall 
retire.”  �
�The devil only 
knows what they�
��re about!” m
uttered Denísov
".
“Ah, Wostó"
"v,” he cried n"
oticing the cade
t’s bright fac
"e,
“you’ve "
got it at last.�
��  And he smi
"led approvingly,"
 evidently pleas
ed with the cade
t. Rostóv felt
 perfectly happy
. Just then the 
commander appear
ed on the bridge
. Denísov gall
oped up to him. 
  “Your excel
lency! Let us at
tack them! I’l
l dwive them off
.”  “Attac
k indeed!” sai
d the colonel in
" a bored voice, "
puckering up his
 face as if dri
ving off a troub
lesome fly. “A
nd why are you s
topping here? D
on’t you see t
he skirmishers a
re retreating? L
ead the squadron
 back.”  Th
e squadron cross
ed the bridge an
d drew out of ra
nge of fire with
out having lost
 a single man. T
he second squadr
on that had been
 in the front l
ine followed the
m across and the
 last Cossacks q
uitted the farth
er side of the 
river.  The tw
o Pávlograd squ
"adrons, having c"
rossed the bridg
"e, retired up th"
e hill one afte
r the other. The
"ir colonel, Karl"
 Bogdánich Schu
"bert, came
up t"
o Denísov’s s
quadron and rode
 at a footpace n
ot far from Rost
"óv,
without ta"
king any notice 
of him although 
they were now me
eting for the f
irst time since 
their encounter 
concerning Tely�
"�nin. Rostóv, f"
eeling that he 
was at the front
 and in the powe
r of a man towar
d whom he now a
dmitted that he 
had been to blam
"e, did not lift "
his eyes from th
e colonel’s a
"thletic back, hi"
s nape covered w
"ith light hair, "
and his red nec
k. It seemed to 
Rostóv that Bog
dánich was only
 pretending not 
"
to notice him, "
and that his who
le aim now was t
o test the cadet
"’s
courage, s"
o he drew himsel
f up and looked 
around him merri
ly; then it see
med to him that 
Bogdánich rode 
so near in order
 to show him his
 courage. Next 
he thought that 
his enemy would 
send the squadro
n on a desperat
e attack just to
 punish him—Ro
stóv. Then he i
"magined how,
af"
"ter the attack, "
Bogdánich would
 come up to him 
as he lay wounde
d and would mag
nanimously exten
d the hand of re
conciliation.  
 The high-should
ered figure of Z
"herkóv, familia"
r to the Pávlog
rads as he had 
but recently lef
t their regiment
", rode up to the"
 colonel. After
 his dismissal f
rom headquarters
 Zherkóv had no
t remained in th
"e
regiment, say"
ing he was not s
uch a fool as to
 slave at the fr
ont when he cou
ld get more rewa
rds by doing not
hing on the staf
"f, and had succe"
eded in attachi
ng himself as an
 orderly officer
 to Prince Bagra
tión. He now c
ame to his forme
r chief with an 
order from the c
ommander of the 
rear guard.  
"“Colonel,” h"
"e said, addressi"
ng Rostóv’s e
nemy with an air
 of gloomy grav
ity and glancing
 round at his co
"mrades, “there"
 is an order to
 stop and fire t
he bridge.”  
 “An order to 
who?” asked th
e colonel morose
ly.  “I don�
��t myself know 
"‘to who,’”"
 replied the cor
net in a seriou
"s tone, “but t"
he prince told m
e to ‘go and t
ell the colonel 
 that the hussar
s must return qu
ickly and fire t
he bridge.’”
  Zherkóv was
 followed by an 
officer of the s
uite who rode up
 to the colonel
 of hussars with
 the same order.
 After him the s
tout Nesvítski 
 came galloping 
up on a Cossack 
horse that could
 scarcely carry 
his weight.  
"“How’s this,"
 Colonel?” he 
shouted as he ap
proached. “I t
old you to fire
" the bridge, and"
 now someone has
 gone and blunde
red; they are al
l beside themse
lves over there 
and one can’t 
make anything ou
t.”  The col
onel deliberatel
y stopped the re
giment and turne
d to Nesvítski.
  “You spoke
 to me of inflam
"mable material,�"
"�� said he, “b"
ut you said not
hing about firin
g it.”  “B
"ut, my dear sir,"
” said Nesvít
ski as he drew u
"p, taking off hi"
s cap and smoot
hing his hair we
t with perspirat
ion with his plu
"mp hand,
“was"
n’t I telling 
you to fire the 
"bridge, when inf"
lammable materia
l had been put 
in position?” 
  “I am not y
"our ‘dear sir,"
’ Mr. Staff Of
"ficer, and you d"
id not tell me 
to burn the brid
ge! I know the s
"ervice, and it i"
s my habit order
s strictly to o
bey. You said th
e bridge would b
"e burned, but wh"
o would burn it
", I could not kn"
ow by the holy s
pirit!”  “
"Ah, that’s alw"
ays the way!” 
said Nesvítski 
with a wave of t
he hand. “How
 did you get her
"e?” said he, t"
urning to Zherk�
�v.  “On the
 same business. 
But you are damp
! Let me wring y
ou out!”  �
�You were saying
", Mr. Staff Offi"
cer...” contin
ued the colonel 
in an offended 
tone.  “Colo
"nel,” interrup"
ted the officer 
"of the suite, �"
�You must be qu
ick or the enemy
 will bring up h
is guns to use g
rapeshot.”  
The colonel look
ed silently at t
he officer of th
"e suite, at the "
stout staff off
"icer, and at Zhe"
"rkóv, and he fr"
owned.  “I w
ill the bridge f
"ire,” he said "
in a solemn tone
 as if to announ
ce that in spit
e of all the unp
leasantness he h
ad to endure he 
would still do 
the right thing.
  Striking his
 horse with his 
long muscular le
gs as if it were
 to blame for e
"verything, the c"
olonel moved for
ward and ordered
 the second squ
"adron, that in w"
hich Rostóv was
 serving under D
"enísov, to retu"
rn to the bridg
"e.

“There, "
it’s just as I
" thought,” sai"
d Rostóv to him
self. “He wis
hes to test me!�
�� His heart con
tracted and the 
blood rushed to 
his face. “Le
t him see whethe
r I am a coward!
” he thought. 
  Again on all 
the bright faces
 of the squadron
 the serious exp
ression appeare
d that they had 
worn when under 
fire. Rostóv wa
"tched his enemy,"
"
the colonel, c"
losely—to find
 in his face con
firmation of his
 own conjecture
", but the colone"
l did not once g
lance at Rostóv
", and looked
as"
 he always did w
hen at the front
", solemn and ste"
rn. Then came th
e word of comma
nd.  “Look s
harp! Look sharp
!” several voi
ces repeated aro
und him.  Thei
r sabers catchin
g in the bridles
 and their spurs
" jingling, the
"
hussars hastily 
"dismounted, not "
knowing what the
y were to do. Th
e men were cros
sing themselves.
 Rostóv no long
er looked at the
" colonel, he
ha"
d no time. He wa
s afraid of fall
ing behind the h
"ussars, so much "
afraid that his
 heart stood sti
ll. His hand tre
mbled as he gave
 his horse into 
 an orderly’s 
"charge, and he f"
elt the blood ru
sh to his heart 
with a thud. De
nísov rode past
" him, leaning ba"
ck and shouting 
something. Rost
óv saw nothing 
but the hussars 
running all arou
"nd him, their sp"
urs catching an
d their sabers c
lattering.  �
�Stretchers!” 
shouted someone 
behind him.  R
ostóv did not t
hink what this c
all for stretche
rs meant; he ran
" on,
trying onl"
y to be ahead of
 the others; but
 just at the bri
"dge, not
lookin"
"g at the ground,"
 he came on some
" sticky, trodden"
" mud, stumbled,"
 and fell on his
 hands. The othe
rs outstripped h
im.  “At bos
"s zides, Captain"
",” he heard th"
e voice of the c
"olonel, who,
ha"
ving ridden ahea
"d, had pulled up"
 his horse near 
"the bridge, with"
" a
triumphant, "
cheerful face. 
 Rostóv wiping
 his muddy hands
 on his breeches
 looked at his e
nemy and was ab
"out to run on, t"
hinking that the
 farther he went
 to the front t
he better. But B
"ogdánich, witho"
ut looking at or
 recognizing Ros
"tóv,
shouted t"
o him:  “Who
’s that runnin
g on the middle 
of the bridge? T
o the right! Com
"e
back, Cadet!�"
�� he cried angr
ily; and turning
" to Denísov, wh"
"o, showing
off "
"his courage, had"
 ridden on to th
e planks of the 
bridge:  “Wh
"y run risks, Cap"
tain? You should
" dismount,” he"
" said.

“Oh,"
 every bullet ha
"s its billet,”"
 answered Váska
" Denísov, turni"
ng in his saddl
e.   Meanwhil
"e Nesvítski, Zh"
"erkóv, and the "
officer of the s
uite were stand
ing together out
 of range of the
" shots, watching"
", now the small"
 group of men wi
th yellow shakos
", dark-green jac"
kets braided wit
"h cord,
and blu"
e riding breeche
"s, who were swar"
ming near the br
"idge, and then a"
t what was appr
oaching in the d
istance from the
 opposite side�
�the blue unifo
rms and groups w
"ith horses, easi"
ly recognizable 
as artillery.  
 “Will they bu
rn the bridge or
 not? Who’ll g
et there first? 
Will they get t
here and fire th
e bridge or will
 the French get 
within grapeshot
 range and wipe
 them out?” Th
ese were the que
stions each man 
of the troops o
n the high groun
d above the brid
ge involuntarily
 asked himself 
with a sinking h
eart—watching 
the bridge and t
he hussars in th
e bright evenin
g light and the 
blue tunics adva
ncing from the o
ther side with 
their bayonets a
nd guns.  “U
gh. The hussars 
will get it hot!
” said Nesvít
ski; “they are
 within grapesh
ot range now.”
  “He should
n’t have taken
" so many men,”"
 said the office
r of the suite.
  “True enou
"gh,” answered "
Nesvítski; “t
wo smart fellows
 could have don
e the job just a
s well.”  �
"�Ah, your excell"
"ency,” put in "
"Zherkóv, his ey"
es fixed on the 
"
hussars, but st"
ill with that na
ïve air that ma
de it impossible
 to know whethe
r he was speakin
g in jest or in 
"earnest. “Ah, "
your excellency!
 How you look a
t things! Send t
wo men? And who 
then would give 
us the Vladími
r medal and ribb
"on? But now, eve"
n if they do get
" peppered, the
"
squadron may be 
recommended for 
honors and he ma
y get a ribbon. 
Our Bogdánich 
knows how things
 are done.”  
 “There now!�
� said the offic
"er of the suite,"
 “that’s gr
apeshot.”  H
e pointed to the
" French guns, th"
e limbers of whi
ch were being de
tached and hurr
iedly removed. 
 On the French 
"side, amid the g"
roups with canno
"n, a cloud of sm"
"oke
appeared, t"
hen a second and
 a third almost 
"simultaneously, "
and at the mome
nt when the firs
t report was hea
rd a fourth was 
seen. Then two 
reports one afte
"r another, and a"
 third.  “Oh
! Oh!” groaned
 Nesvítski as i
f in fierce pain
", seizing the
o"
fficer of the su
ite by the arm. 
“Look! A man h
as fallen! Falle
"n,
fallen!”
"
"
“Two, I thin"
k.”  “If I
 were Tsar I wou
ld never go to w
"ar,” said Nesv"
"ítski, turning"
 away.  The Fr
ench guns were h
astily reloaded.
 The infantry in
 their blue uni
forms advanced t
oward the bridge
 at a run. Smoke
 appeared again 
 but at irregula
"r intervals, and"
 grapeshot crack
ed and rattled o
nto the bridge.
 But this time N
esvítski could 
not see what was
 happening there
",
as a dense cl"
oud of smoke aro
se from it. The 
hussars had succ
eeded in settin
g it on fire and
 the French batt
eries were now f
"iring at them, n"
o longer to hin
der them but bec
ause the guns we
re trained and t
here was someon
e to fire at.  
 The French had 
time to fire thr
ee rounds of gra
peshot before th
e hussars got b
ack to their hor
ses. Two were mi
sdirected and th
e shot went too 
"
high, but the l"
ast round fell i
n the midst of a
 group of hussar
s and knocked t
hree of them ove
"r.

Rostóv, a"
bsorbed by his r
elations with Bo
"gdánich, had pa"
used on the bri
dge not knowing 
what to do. Ther
e was no one to 
hew down (as he 
 had always imag
ined battles to 
"himself), nor co"
uld he help to f
ire the bridge 
because he had n
ot brought any b
urning straw wit
h him like the 
other soldiers. 
He stood looking
" about him, when"
 suddenly he hea
rd a rattle on 
the bridge as if
 nuts were being
" spilt, and the "
hussar nearest 
to him fell agai
nst the rails wi
th a groan. Rost
óv ran up to hi
m with the othe
rs. Again someon
"e shouted, “St"
retchers!” Fou
r men seized the
 hussar and beg
an lifting him. 
  “Oooh! For 
Christ’s sake 
let me alone!”
 cried the wound
"ed man, but
sti"
ll he was lifted
 and laid on the
 stretcher.  N
icholas Rostóv 
"turned away and,"
 as if searching
" for something, "
gazed into the 
"distance, at the"
 waters of the D
"anube, at the sk"
"y, and at the
s"
un. How beautifu
l the sky looked
"; how blue, how "
"calm, and how de"
ep! How bright 
and glorious was
 the setting sun
! With what soft
 glitter the wa
ters of the dist
ant Danube shone
. And fairer sti
ll were the fara
way blue mounta
ins beyond the r
"iver, the nunner"
"y, the mysteriou"
"s gorges, and
t"
he pine forests 
veiled in the mi
st of their summ
its... There was
 peace and happ
iness... “I sh
ould wish for no
"thing else, noth"
"ing, if only I
"
"were there,” t"
hought Rostóv. 
“In myself alo
ne and in that s
unshine there i
s so much happin
ess; but here...
" groans, sufferi"
"ng, fear, and
t"
his uncertainty 
and hurry... The

 running back so
"mewhere, and I s"

"th, is here abov"
e me and around.
.. Another insta
nt and I shall n
ever again see 
"the sun, this wa"
"ter, that gorge!"
...”  At tha
t instant the su
n began to hide 
behind the cloud
"s, and other
st"
retchers came in
to view before R
ostóv. And the 
fear of death an
d of the stretc
"hers, and love o"
f the sun and of
" life, all merge"
d into one feel
ing of sickening
 agitation.  �
��O Lord God! Th
ou who art in th
"at heaven, save,"
" forgive, and pr"
otect me!” Ro
stóv whispered.
  The hussars 
ran back to the 
men who held the
ir horses; their
 voices sounded
 louder and calm
"er, the stretche"
rs disappeared f
rom sight.  �
"�Well, fwiend? S"
o you’ve smelt
 powdah!” shou
ted Váska Dení
sov just above 
his ear.  “I
t’s all over; 
but I am a cowar
"d—yes, a cowar"
d!” thought R
"ostóv, and sigh"
ing deeply he to
"ok Rook, his hor"
"se, which stood "
resting one foo
"t, from the orde"
rly and began to
 mount.  “Wa

?” he asked De
nísov.  “Ye

sov. “You work

�s nasty work! A

asant work! Hack

sort of thing is
" the very devil,"
 with them shoo

 And Denísov ro
de up to a group
 that had stoppe
"d near Rostóv, "
composed of the
" colonel, Nesví"
"tski, Zherkóv, "
and the officer 
from the suite. 
"

“Well, it s"
eems that no one
" has noticed,”"
 thought Rostóv
. And this was 
true. No one had
 taken any notic

knew the sensati
on which the ca

 “See if I do

�Inform the prin

��with which the
 Russians fough

 at Ulm and had

 at Braunau now 
separated from t

 and Kutúzov w
as left with onl

modern science o

d been handed to
 Kutúzov when h

 by the Austrian
" Hofkriegsrath, "
the sole and alm

 aim remaining 
for him was to e
ffect a junction
 with the forces
 that were adva

"a, without losin"

with his army cr
ossed to the le

p a position for
 the first time 
 with the river 
between himself 
and the main bod

 On the thirtie

"n the left bank,"
 and broke it u
p. In this actio
n for the first 
time trophies we
re taken: banne

"t time, after a"
 fortnight’s r
"etreat, the Russ"
ian troops had h
alted and after 
a fight had not
 only held the f

"wounded, sick, a"

sta"

 and the victory
 over Mortier ra

 of the army co

ughout the whole
 army and at hea

joyful though er
roneous rumors w
ere rife of the 
imaginary approa
ch of columns f
"rom Russia, of s"
ome victory gain
ed by the Austri
"ans, and of
the"
 retreat of the 
frightened Bonap
arte.  Prince 
Andrew during th
e battle had bee
n in attendance 
on the Austrian 
 General Schmidt
", who was killed"
 in the action. 
His horse had be
en wounded unde
r him and his ow
n arm slightly g
razed by a bulle
t. As a mark of
 the commander i
n chief’s spec
ial favor he was
 sent with the n
ews of this vic
tory to the Aust
"rian court, now "
no longer at Vie
nna (which was 
threatened by th
e French) but at
 Brünn. Despite
 his apparently 
delicate build 
Prince Andrew co
uld endure physi
cal fatigue far 
better than many
 very muscular 
"men, and on the "
night of the bat
"tle, having arri"
ved at Krems ex
cited but not we
"ary, with dispat"
ches from Dokht�

"v, he was sent i"
mmediately with 
a special dispat
ch to Brünn. T
o be so sent mea
nt not only a re
ward but an impo
rtant step towar
d promotion.  
 The night was d
"ark but starry, "
the road showed 
black in the sno
w that had fall
en the previous 
day—the day of
 the battle. Rev
iewing his impr
essions of the r
"ecent battle, pi"
cturing pleasant
ly to himself th
e impression hi
s news of a vict
ory would create
", or recalling t"
he send-off giv
en him by the co
mmander in chief
 and his fellow 
"officers, Prince"
 Andrew was gal
loping along in 
a post chaise en
joying the feeli
ngs of a man wh
o has at length 
begun to attain 
a long-desired h
appiness. As soo
n as he closed 
his eyes his ear
s seemed filled 
with the rattle 
of the wheels a
nd the sensation
 of victory. The
n he began to im
agine that the 
Russians were ru
nning away and t
hat he himself w
"as killed, but h"
e quickly rouse
d himself with a
" feeling of joy,"
 as if learning 
afresh that thi
s was not so but
 that on the con
trary the French
 had run away. H
e again recalle
d all the detail
s of the victory
 and his own cal
m courage durin
"g the battle, an"
d feeling reassu
red he dozed off
.... The dark s
tarry night was 
followed by a br
ight cheerful mo
rning. The snow 
was thawing in 
"the sunshine, th"
e horses gallope
"d quickly, and o"
n both sides of
 the road were f
orests of differ
"ent kinds, field"
"s, and villages."
  At one of th
e post stations 
he overtook a co
nvoy of Russian 
wounded. The Ru
ssian officer in
 charge of the t
ransport lolled 
back in the fron
"t
cart, shoutin"
g and scolding a
 soldier with co
arse abuse. In e
ach of the long
 German carts si
"x or more pale, "
"dirty, bandaged "
men were being 
jolted over the 
stony road. Some
 of them were ta
lking (he heard 
"Russian
words),"
 others were eat
ing bread; the m
ore severely wou
nded looked sil
"ently, with the "
languid interest
 of sick childre
"n, at the envoy"
 hurrying past t
hem.  Prince A
ndrew told his d
"river to stop, a"
nd asked a soldi
er in what acti
on they had been
 wounded. “Day
 before yesterda
"y, on the Danube"
",”
answered t"
he soldier. Prin
ce Andrew took o
ut his purse and
 gave the soldi
er three gold pi
eces.  “That
’s for them al
"l,” he said to"
 the officer who
 came up.  “
"Get well soon, l"
ads!” he conti
"nued, turning to"
 the soldiers. 
“There’s ple
nty to do still.
”  “What n
"ews, sir?” ask"
"ed the officer, "
evidently anxiou
s to start a co
nversation.  �
��Good news!... 
Go on!” he sho
uted to the driv
"er, and they gal"
loped on.  It
 was already qui
te dark when Pri
nce Andrew rattl
ed over the pave
d streets of Br
ünn and found h
imself surrounde
d by high buildi
"ngs, the
lights"
" of shops, house"
"s, and street la"
"mps, fine carria"
"ges, and all tha"
t atmosphere of
 a large and act
ive town which i
s always so attr
active to a sol
dier after camp 
life. Despite hi
s rapid journey 
and sleepless ni
"ght,
Prince And"
rew when he drov
e up to the pala
ce felt even mor
e vigorous and 
alert than he ha
d done the day b
efore. Only his 
eyes gleamed fev
erishly and his
 thoughts follow
ed one another w
ith extraordinar
y clearness and 
 rapidity. He ag
ain vividly reca
lled the details
" of the battle, "
"no longer
dim, "
but definite and
 in the concise 
form in which he
 imagined himsel
f stating them 
to the Emperor F
rancis. He vivid
ly imagined the 
casual question
s that might be 
put to him and t
he answers he wo
uld give. He ex
pected to be at 
once presented t
o the Emperor. A
t the chief entr
ance to the pal
"ace, however, an"
 official came r
unning out to me
"et him, and
lea"
rning that he wa
s a special mess
enger led him to
 another entranc
e.  “To the 
right from the c
"orridor, Euer Ho"
chgeboren! There
 you will find 
the adjutant on 
"duty,” said th"
e official. “H
e will conduct y
ou to the Minis
ter of War.” 
 The adjutant o
"n duty, meeting "
"Prince Andrew, a"
sked him to wait
", and went
in t"
o the Minister o
f War. Five minu
tes later he ret
urned and bowing
 with particula
r courtesy usher
ed Prince Andrew
 before him alon
g a corridor to
 the cabinet whe
re the Minister 
of War was at wo
rk. The adjutan
t by his elabora
te courtesy appe
ared to wish to 
ward off any at
tempt at familia
rity on the part
 of the Russian 
messenger.  Pr
ince Andrew’s 
joyous feeling w
as considerably 
weakened as he 
approached the d
oor of the minis
ter’s room. He
" felt offended, "
and without his
 noticing it the
 feeling of offe
nse immediately 
turned into one
 of disdain whic
h was quite unca
lled for. His fe
rtile mind insta
ntly suggested 
to him a point o
f view which gav
e him a right to
 despise the ad
jutant and the m
inister. “Away
 from the smell 
"of powder, they"
 probably think 
it easy to gain 
victories!” he
 thought. His ey
es narrowed dis
"dainfully, he en"
tered the room o
f the Minister o
f War with pecu
liarly deliberat
e steps. This fe
eling of disdain
 was heightened 
 when he saw the
 minister seated
 at a large tabl
e reading some p
apers and makin
g pencil notes o
"n them, and for "
the first two or
 three minutes 
taking no notice
 of his arrival.
 A wax candle st
ood at each side
 of the ministe
r’s bent bald 
head with its gr
ay temples. He w
ent on reading 
"to the end, with"
out raising his 
eyes at the open
ing of the door 
and the sound o
f footsteps.  
“Take this and
" deliver it,” "
said he to his a
"djutant, handing"
 him the papers
 and still takin
g no notice of t
he special messe
nger.  Prince 
Andrew felt that
 either the acti
ons of Kutúzov�
��s army intere
sted the Ministe
r of War less th
an any of the ot
her matters he w
as concerned wi
"th, or he wanted"
 to give the Rus
sian special mes
senger that imp
ression. “But 
that is a matter
 of perfect indi
"fference to me,�"
�� he thought. 
The minister dre
w the remaining 
"papers together,"
 arranged them 
"evenly, and then"
 raised his head
. He had an inte
llectual and dis
"tinctive
head, "
but the instant 
he turned to Pri
nce Andrew the f
"irm, intelligent"
 expression on 
his face changed
 in a way eviden
tly deliberate a
nd habitual to 
him. His face to
ok on the stupid
 artificial smil
e (which does n
ot even attempt 
to hide its arti
ficiality) of a 
man who is cont
inually receivin
g many petitione
rs one after ano
ther.  “From
 General Field M
arshal Kutúzov?
” he asked. �
�I hope it is g
ood news? There 
has been an enco
unter with Morti
er? A victory? I
t was high time
!”  He took 
the dispatch whi
ch was addressed
 to him and bega
n to read it wi
th a mournful ex
pression.  “
"Oh, my God! My G"
od! Schmidt!” 
he exclaimed in 
German. “What 
a calamity! Wha
t a calamity!”
  Having glanc
ed through the d
ispatch he laid 
it on the table 
and looked at P
"rince Andrew, ev"
idently consider
ing something. 
 “Ah what a c
alamity! You say
 the affair was 
decisive? But Mo
rtier is not ca
ptured.” Again
 he pondered. �
�I am very glad 
you have brought
"
good news, tho"
ugh Schmidt’s 
death is a heavy
 price to pay fo
r the victory. 
His Majesty will
 no doubt wish t
"o see you, but n"
ot today. I tha
nk you! You must
 have a rest. Be
 at the levee to
morrow after the
 parade. Howeve
"r, I will let yo"
u know.”  Th
"e stupid smile, "
which had left h
is face while he
" was speaking,
"
reappeared.  �
��Au revoir! Tha
nk you very much
. His Majesty wi
ll probably desi
"re to
see you,�"
"�� he added, bow"
ing his head.  
 When Prince And
rew left the pal
ace he felt that
 all the interes
t and happiness
 the victory had
 afforded him ha
d been now left 
in the indiffer
ent hands of the
 Minister of War
 and the polite 
adjutant. The w
hole tenor of hi
s thoughts insta
ntaneously chang
ed; the battle s
eemed the memor
y of a remote ev
ent long past.

"
“Ah, my dear"
 prince! I could
 not have a more
 welcome visitor
",”
said Bilí"
bin as he came o

 said he to the 
servant who was

eh? Splendid! A

"here ill, as you"
 see.”  Afte
r washing and dr
"essing, Prince A"
ndrew came into 
the diplomat’s
 luxurious stud
y and sat down t
o the dinner pre
pared for him. B
ilíbin settled
 down comfortabl
y beside the fir
e.  After his 
journey and the 
campaign during 
which he had bee
n deprived of a
ll the comforts 
of cleanliness a
nd all the refin
"ements of life, "
Prince Andrew f
elt a pleasant s
ense of repose a
mong luxurious s
urroundings such
 as he had been
 accustomed to f
rom childhood. B
esides it was pl
"easant,
after h"
is reception by 
"the Austrians, t"
o speak if not i
n Russian (for 
they were speaki
ng French) at le
ast with a Russi
"an who would, he"
"
supposed, shar"
e the general Ru
ssian antipathy 
to the Austrians
 which was then
 particularly st
rong.  Bilíbi
n was a man of t
"hirty-five, a ba"
"chelor, and of t"
he same circle a
s Prince Andrew
. They had known
 each other prev
iously in Peters
"burg, but
had b"
ecome more intim
ate when Prince 
Andrew was in Vi
enna with Kutúz
ov. Just as Pri
nce Andrew was a
 young man who g
ave promise of r
ising high in t
he military prof
"ession, so to an"
 even greater ex
tent Bilíbin ga
ve promise of r
ising in his dip
lomatic career. 
He was still a y
oung man but no
 longer a young 
"diplomat, as he "
had entered the 
service at the a
"ge
of sixteen, "
had been in Pari
s and Copenhagen
", and now held a"
 rather importa
nt post in Vienn
a. Both the fore
ign minister and
 our ambassador 
 in Vienna knew 
him and valued h
im. He was not o
ne of those many
 diplomats who 
are esteemed bec
ause they have c
ertain negative 
"qualities,
avoi"
d doing certain 
"things, and spea"
k French. He was
" one of those,
"
"who, liking work"
", knew how to do"
" it, and despite"
 his indolence w
ould sometimes 
spend a whole ni
ght at his writi
ng table. He wor
ked well whatev
er the import of
 his work. It wa
s not the questi
on “What for?�
�� but the ques
tion “How?” 
that interested 
him. What the di
plomatic matter
 might be he did
" not care, but i"
t gave him great
 pleasure to pr
epare a circular
", memorandum, or"
" report, skillfu"
"lly, pointedly, "
and elegantly. 
Bilíbin’s ser
vices were value
d not only for w
"hat he wrote,
b"
ut also for his 
skill in dealing
 and conversing 
with those in th
e highest spher
es.  Bilíbin 
liked conversati
on as he liked w
"ork, only when i"
t could be made
 elegantly witty
. In society he 
always awaited a
n opportunity to
 say something 
striking and too
k part in a conv
ersation only wh
en that was pos
sible. His conve
rsation was alwa
ys sprinkled wit
h wittily origin
"al,
finished ph"
rases of general
 interest. These
 sayings were pr
epared in the i
nner laboratory 
of his mind in a
 portable form a
s if intentional
"ly, so
that ins"
ignificant socie
ty people might 
carry them from 
drawing room to 
 drawing room. A
"nd, in fact, Bil"
íbin’s wittic
isms were hawked
 about in the V
iennese drawing 
rooms and often 
had an influence
 on matters con
sidered importan
"t.

His thin, "
"worn, sallow fac"
e was covered wi
th deep wrinkles
", which always
"
looked as clean 
and well washed 
as the tips of o
ne’s fingers a
fter a Russian 
bath. The moveme
nt of these wrin
kles formed the 
principal play 
of expression on
 his face. Now h
is forehead woul
d pucker into de
ep folds and hi
s eyebrows were 
"lifted, then his"
 eyebrows would 
descend and dee
p wrinkles would
 crease his chee
"ks. His small, d"
eep-set eyes alw
ays twinkled an
d looked out str
aight.  “Wel
"l, now tell me a"
bout your exploi
"ts,” said he."
"

Bolkónski, v"
ery modestly wit
hout once mentio
"ning himself, de"
scribed the eng
agement and his 
reception by the
 Minister of War
.  “They rec
eived me and my 
news as one rece
ives a dog in a 
game of skittle
"s,” said he in"
 conclusion.  
Bilíbin smiled 
and the wrinkles
 on his face dis
appeared.  “
"Cependant, mon c"
"her,” he remar"
"ked, examining h"
is nails from a 
 distance and pu
ckering the skin
 above his left

s not      part
icularly victori
ous.”   He 
went on talking 
in this way in F
"rench, uttering "
only those words
 in Russian on 
which he wished 
to put a contemp
tuous emphasis. 
  “Come now! 
You with all you
r forces fall on
 the unfortunate
 Mortier and hi
"s one division, "
and even then Mo
rtier slips thro
ugh your fingers
! Where’s the
 victory?”  
“But seriously
",” said Prince"
" Andrew, “we c"
an at any rate s
ay without boas

��  “Why did

”  “Becaus

 “And why did

�� returned Bil�
�bin with a smil

  “Why did yo

that he had bett

lone?” retorte
d Prince Andrew 
 in the same ton
"e.

“I know,"
” interrupted 
"Bilíbin, “you"
’re thinking i
t’s very easy

Not only occupie

  “Really I 
don’t care abo

"�t care at all,�"
�� said Prince 
"Andrew, beginnin"
g to understand 
that his news of
 the battle bef
ore Krems was re
ally of small im
portance in view
 of such events 
as the fall of 
Austria’s capi
tal. “How is i
t Vienna was tak
en? What of the
 bridge and its 
celebrated bridg
ehead and Prince
 Auersperg? We h
eard reports th
at Prince Auersp
erg was defendin
g Vienna?” he 
said.  “Prin
ce Auersperg is 
"on this, on our "
side of the rive
"r, and is
defen"
ding us—doing 
"it very badly, I"
" think, but stil"
l he is defendin
g us. But Vienn
a is on the othe
"r side. No, the "
bridge has not y
et been taken a
nd I hope it wil

 is mined and or

 up. Otherwise w
e should long ag
o have been in t

would have spent
 a bad quarter

  “But still
 this does not m

"re think so too,"

",” said Bilíb"
in quoting one 
"of his own mots,"
 releasing the w
rinkles on his f
"orehead, and
pa"
using. “The on

 clenching his 
small hand and s
triking the tabl

“Buonaparte?�

�Impossible!”

��  “If we l
ive we shall see
",” replied Bil"
"íbin, his face "
again becoming 
smooth as a sign
 that the conver
sation was at an
 end.  When Pr
ince Andrew reac
hed the room pre
pared for him an
d lay down in a 
 clean shirt on 
the feather bed 
with its warmed 
and fragrant pil
"lows, he
felt t"
hat the battle o
f which he had b
rought tidings w
"as far, far
awa"
y from him. The 
alliance with Pr
"ussia, Austria�"
"�s treachery,
B"
onaparte’s new
" triumph, tomorr"
ow’s levee and
" parade, and the"
 audience with 
the Emperor Fran
cis occupied his
 thoughts.  He
 closed his eyes
", and immediatel"
y a sound of can
"nonading, of mus"
ketry and the r
attling of carri
age wheels seeme
d to fill his ea
"rs, and now
aga"
in drawn out in 
a thin line the 
musketeers were 
descending the h
"ill,
the French"
" were firing, an"
d he felt his he
art palpitating 
as he rode forw
ard beside Schmi
dt with the bull
ets merrily whis
tling all around
",
and he experi"
enced tenfold th
"e joy of living,"
 as he had not d
one since child
hood.  He woke
 up...  “Yes
", that all happe"
"ned!” he said,"
" and, smiling ha"
ppily to himself
"
like a child, "
he fell into a d
"eep, youthful sl"
umber.     
 CHAPTER XI  
Next day he woke
 late. Recalling
 his recent impr
"essions, the fir"
st thought that
 came into his m
ind was that tod
ay he had to be 
presented to th
e Emperor Franci
s; he remembered
 the Minister of
" War, the polite"
 Austrian adjut
"ant, Bilíbin, a"
nd last night’
s conversation. 
Having dressed 
for his attendan
ce at court in f
ull parade unifo
"rm, which he
ha"
d not worn for a
" long time, he w"
ent into Bilíbi
n’s study fres
"h,
animated, an"
"d handsome, with"
 his hand bandag
ed. In the study
 were four gent
lemen of the dip
lomatic corps. W
ith Prince Hippo
"lyte Kurágin,
"
who was a secret
ary to the embas
"sy, Bolkónski w"
as already acqua
inted. Bilíbin
 introduced him 
to the others. 
 The gentlemen 
assembled at Bil
íbin’s were y
"oung, wealthy, g"
"ay society
men,"
" who here, as in"
" Vienna, formed "
a special set wh
"ich Bilíbin, th"
"eir
leader, cal"
led les nôtres.
" * This set, con"
sisting almost e
xclusively of d
"iplomats, eviden"
tly had its own 
interests which 
had nothing to d
o with war or p
olitics but rela
ted to high soci
"ety, to certain "
"women, and to
t"
he official side
 of the service.
 These gentlemen
 received Prince
 Andrew as one 
"of themselves, a"
n honor they did
 not extend to m
any. From polit
eness and to sta
"rt conversation,"
 they asked him 
a few questions 
 about the army 
"and the battle, "
and then the tal
k went off into 
merry jests and
 gossip.      
* Ours.  “Bu
t the best of it
" was,” said on"
"e, telling of th"
e misfortune of 
 a fellow diplom
"at, “that the "
Chancellor told 
him flatly that 
his appointment
 to London was a
 promotion and t
hat he was so to
 regard it. Can
 you fancy the f
igure he cut?...
”  “But th
"e worst of it, g"
entlemen—I am 
giving Kurágin 
away to you—i
s that that man 
"suffers, and thi"
"s Don Juan, wick"
"ed fellow, is
t"
aking advantage 
of it!”  Pri
nce Hippolyte wa
s lolling in a l
ounge chair with
 his legs over i
ts arm. He bega
n to laugh.  �
��Tell me about 
that!” he said
".

“Oh, you "
Don Juan! You se
rpent!” cried 
several voices. 
"

“You, Bolk�"
"�nski, don’t k"
"now,” said Bil"
íbin turning to
" Prince
Andrew,"
 “that all the
 atrocities of t
he French army (
I nearly said of
 the Russian ar
my) are nothing 
compared to what
 this man has be
en doing among 
the women!”  
 “La femme est
 la compagne de 
"l’homme,” * "
announced Prince
"
Hippolyte, and"
 began looking t
hrough a lorgnet
te at his elevat
ed legs.      
* “Woman is ma
n’s companion.
”   Bilíbi
n and the rest o
f “ours” bur
st out laughing 
in Hippolyte’s
"
face, and Prin"
ce Andrew saw th
"at Hippolyte, of"
 whom—he had t
o admit—he ha
d almost been je
alous on his wif
"e’s account, w"
as the butt of 
this set.  “
"Oh, I must give "
"you a treat,” "
Bilíbin whisper
ed to Bolkónski
. “Kurágin i
s exquisite when
 he discusses po
litics—you sho
uld see his gra
vity!”  He s
at down beside H
ippolyte and wri
nkling his foreh
ead began talkin
g to him about 
politics. Prince
 Andrew and the 
others gathered 
round these two
.  “The Berl
in cabinet canno
t express a feel
"ing of alliance,"
” began Hippo
lyte gazing roun
d with importanc
"e at the others,"
 “without exp
ressing... as in
 its last note..
. you understand
"... Besides, unl"
ess His Majesty
 the Emperor der
ogates from the 
principle of our
 alliance...  
"“Wait, I have "
not finished...�
�� he said to Pr
"ince Andrew, sei"
zing him by the
" arm, “I belie"
ve that interven
tion will be str
onger than noni
ntervention. And
...” he paused
. “Finally one
 cannot impute t
he nonreceipt o
f our dispatch o
f November 18. T
hat is how it wi
ll end.” And 
he released Bolk
ónski’s arm t
o indicate that 
he had now quite
 finished.  �
"��Demosthenes, I"
 know thee by th
e pebble thou se
cretest in thy g
olden mouth!”
" said Bilíbin, "
and the mop of h
air on his head 
moved with sati
sfaction.  Eve
"rybody laughed, "
and Hippolyte lo
uder than anyone
. He was evident
"ly
distressed, "
and breathed pai
"nfully, but coul"
d not restrain t
he wild laughte
r that convulsed
 his usually imp
assive features.
"

“Well now,"

     CHAPTE
R XII  At the 
levee Prince And
rew stood among 
the Austrian off
icers as he had 
"
been told to, a"
nd the Emperor F
rancis merely lo
oked fixedly int
o his face and 
just nodded to h
im with his long
 head. But after
" it was
over, t"
he adjutant he h
ad seen the prev
ious day ceremon
iously informed 
 Bolkónski that
 the Emperor des
ired to give him
 an audience. Th
e Emperor Franc
is received him 
standing in the 
middle of the ro
om. Before the 
conversation beg
an Prince Andrew
 was struck by t
he fact that the
 Emperor seemed
 confused and bl
ushed as if not 
knowing what to 
say.  “Tell 
"me, when did the"
 battle begin?�
� he asked hurri
edly.  Prince 
Andrew replied. 
Then followed ot
her questions ju
st as simple: �
��Was Kutúzov w
ell? When had he
 left Krems?” 
and so on. The E
mperor spoke as
 if his sole aim
 were to put a g
iven number of q
uestions—the 
answers to these
" questions, as w"
as only too evid
"ent, did not int"
erest him.  �
��At what o’cl
ock did the batt
le begin?” ask
ed the Emperor. 
  “I cannot i
nform Your Majes
ty at what o’c
lock the battle 
began at the fr
"ont, but at Dür"
"renstein, where "
"I was, our attac"
k began after f
ive in the after
"noon,” replied"
 Bolkónski grow
ing more animate
d and expecting
 that he would h
ave a chance to 
give a reliable 
"account, which
"
he had ready in 
"his mind, of all"
 he knew and had
 seen. But the E
mperor smiled a
nd interrupted h
im.  “How ma
ny miles?”  
“From where to
" where, Your Maj"
esty?”  “F
rom Dürrenstein
 to Krems.”  
 “Three and a 
"half miles, Your"
 Majesty.”  
“The French ha
ve abandoned the
 left bank?” 
 “According t
o the scouts the
 last of them cr
ossed on rafts d
uring the night
.”  “Is th
ere sufficient f
orage in Krems?�
��  “Forage 
has not been sup
plied to the ext
ent...”  The
 Emperor interru
pted him.  “
At what o’cloc
k was General Sc
hmidt killed?”
  “At seven 
"o’clock, I bel"
ieve.”  “A
t seven o’cloc
k? It’s very s
"ad, very sad!”"
  The Emperor 
thanked Prince A
ndrew and bowed.
 Prince Andrew w
ithdrew and was
 immediately sur
rounded by court
iers on all side
s. Everywhere he
 saw friendly l
ooks and heard f
riendly words. Y
esterday’s adj
utant reproache
d him for not ha
ving stayed at t
"he palace, and o"
ffered him his 
own house. The M
inister of War c
ame up and congr
atulated him on 
the Maria There
sa Order of the 
"third grade, whi"
ch the Emperor w
as conferring o
n him. The Empre
ss’ chamberlai
n invited him to
 see Her Majesty
. The archduche
ss also wished t
o see him. He di
d not know whom 
"to answer, and
"
for a few second
s collected his 
thoughts. Then t
he Russian ambas
sador took him 
"by the shoulder,"
 led him to the 
"window, and bega"
n to talk to hi
m.  Contrary t
o Bilíbin’s f
orecast the news
 he had brought 
was joyfully re
ceived. A thanks
giving service w
"as arranged, Kut"
úzov was awarde
d the Grand Cro
ss of Maria Ther
"esa, and the who"
le army received
 rewards. Bolk�
�nski was invite
"d everywhere, an"
d had to spend t
he whole morning
 calling on the
 principal Austr
ian dignitaries.
 Between four an
d five in the a
"fternoon, having"
 made all his ca
"lls, he was retu"
rning to Bilíb
in’s house thi
nking out a lett
er to his father
 about the battl
e and his visit
 to Brünn. At t
he door he found
 a vehicle half 
full of luggage
". Franz, Bilíbi"
"n’s man, was d"
ragging a portma
nteau with some 
 difficulty out 
of the front doo
r.  Before ret
urning to Bilíb
in’s Prince An
drew had gone to
 a bookshop to 
provide himself 
with some books 
for the campaign
", and had spent "
some time in th
e shop.  “Wh
at is it?” he 
"asked.

“Oh,"
 your excellency
"!” said Franz,"
 with difficulty
 rolling the po
rtmanteau into t
"he vehicle, “w"
e are to move on
 still farther. 
The scoundrel i
s again at our h
eels!”  “E
h? What?” aske
d Prince Andrew.
  Bilíbin cam
e out to meet hi
m. His usually c
alm face showed 
excitement.  �
��There now! Con
fess that this i
"s delightful,”"
 said he. “Thi
s affair of the
" Thabor Bridge, "
at Vienna.... Th
ey have crossed 
without strikin
g a blow!”  
Prince Andrew co
uld not understa
nd.  “But wh
ere do you come 
from not to know
 what every coac
hman in the tow
n knows?”  �
��I come from th
e archduchess’
. I heard nothin
g there.”  �
��And you didn�
�t see that ever
ybody is packing
 up?”  “I 
did not... What 
is it all about?
” inquired Pri
nce Andrew impa
tiently.  “W
hat’s it all a
"bout? Why, the F"
rench have cross
ed the bridge th
at Auersperg wa
"s defending, and"
 the bridge was 
not blown up: so
 Murat is now r
ushing along the
 road to Brünn 
and will be here
 in a day or tw
o.”  “What
? Here? But why 
did they not blo
"w up the bridge,"
 if it was mine
d?”  “That
 is what I ask y
"ou. No one, not "
"even Bonaparte, "
knows why.”  
 Bolkónski shru
gged his shoulde
rs.  “But if
 the bridge is c
rossed it means 
that the army to
o is lost? It w
"ill be cut off,�"
�� said he.  �
��That’s just

Bilíbin. “Lis

 sadly and serio

 grieved him and
 yet he was plea

as he learned th
at the Russian a

a hopeless situ

d to him that it
 was he who was 
destined to lead
 it out of this
 position; that 
here was the Tou

offer him the fi

! Listening to 
Bilíbin he was 
already imaginin

council which wo
uld be the only 
one that could 
"save the army, a"
nd how he alone 
would be entrust

"his jesting,” "
he said.  “I
" am not jesting,"
” Bilíbin wen
t on. “Nothing

n spite of the a

 did not forget 
to pause after 
this mot to give
 time for its du

 “I have been

  In Brünn ev

 being dispatche

ar Hetzelsdorf P
rince Andrew st
ruck the high ro
ad along which t
he Russian army 
was moving with 
 great haste and
 in the greatest
 disorder. The r
oad was so obstr
ucted with cart
s that it was im
possible to get 
by in a carriage
. Prince Andrew 
 took a horse an
d a Cossack from
 a Cossack comma
"nder, and hungry"
" and
weary, mak"
ing his way past
 the baggage wag
"ons, rode in sea"
rch of the comm
ander in chief a
nd of his own lu
ggage. Very sini
ster reports of 
the position of
 the army reache
d him as he went
" along, and the "
appearance of t
he troops in the
ir disorderly fl
ight confirmed t
hese rumors.  
“Cette armée 
russe que l’or
 de l’Angleter
re a transporté
e des extrémit
és de l’unive

lui faire éprou
ver le même so

membered these w

an"
d they awoke in 
him astonishment
 at the genius o
"f his hero, a fe"

�And should ther

� he thought. �
"�Well, if need b"

 no worse than 
others.”    
   * “That Rus

has been brought
 from the ends o
f      the eart

"d, we shall caus"
e to share the s
ame      fate�
�(the fate of th

��   He looke
d with disdain a
t the endless co
nfused mass of d
"etachments,
car"
"ts, guns, artill"
"ery, and again b"
aggage wagons an
d vehicles of al
l kinds overtak
ing one another 
and blocking the
" muddy road, thr"
ee and sometime
s four abreast. 
"From all sides, "
behind and befor
"e, as far as ear"
"
could reach, t"
here were the ra
"ttle of wheels, "
the creaking of 
carts and gun c
"arriages, the tr"
"amp of horses, t"
he crack of whip
"s, shouts, the
"
urging of horses
", and the sweari"
"ng of soldiers, "
"orderlies, and o"
fficers. All al
ong the sides of
 the road fallen
 horses were to 
"be seen, some
f"
"layed, some not,"
 and broken-down
 carts beside wh
ich solitary sol
diers sat waiti
ng for something

iers straggling 
from their comp
"anies, crowds of"
 whom set off to
 the neighboring
" villages, or
r"
eturned from the
m dragging sheep
", fowls, hay, an"
d bulging sacks.
 At each ascent
 or descent of t
he road the crow
ds were yet dens
er and the din 
of shouting more
 incessant. Sold
iers floundering
 knee-deep in mu
d pushed the gu
ns and wagons th
emselves. Whips 
"cracked, hoofs s"
"lipped,
traces "
"broke, and lungs"
 were strained w
ith shouting. Th
e officers dire
cting the march 
rode backward an
d forward betwee
n the carts. The
ir voices were 
but feebly heard
 amid the uproar
 and one saw by 
their faces tha
t they despaired
 of the possibil
ity of checking 
this disorder. 
 “Here is our
 dear Orthodox R
"ussian army,” "
thought Bolkóns
"ki,
recalling B"
ilíbin’s word
s.  Wishing to
 find out where 
the commander in
" chief was, he r"
ode up to a con
voy. Directly op
posite to him ca
me a strange one
"-horse vehicle,"
 evidently rigge
d up by soldiers
 out of any avai
lable materials 
and looking lik
e something betw
"een a cart, a ca"
"briolet, and a c"
alèche. A sold
"ier was driving,"
 and a woman env
eloped in shawls
 sat behind the 
 apron under the
 leather hood of
 the vehicle. Pr
ince Andrew rode
 up and was jus
t putting his qu
estion to a sold
ier when his att
ention was dive
rted by the desp
erate shrieks of
 the woman in th
e vehicle. An o
fficer in charge
 of transport wa
s beating the so
ldier who was dr
iving the woman
’s vehicle for
 trying to get a
"head of others, "
and the strokes 
 of his whip fel
l on the apron o
f the equipage. 
The woman scream
ed piercingly. 
Seeing Prince An
drew she leaned 
out from behind 
"the apron
and, "
waving her thin 
arms from under 
the woolen shawl
", cried:

“M"
r. Aide-de-camp!
 Mr. Aide-de-cam
p!... For heaven
’s sake... Pro
tect me! What w
ill become of us
? I am the wife 
of the doctor of
 the Seventh Ch
asseurs.... They
 won’t let us 
"pass, we are lef"
t behind and hav

’ll flatten yo
u into a pancake
!” shouted the
 angry officer t
o the soldier. 
“Turn back wit
h your slut!” 
  “Mr. Aide-d
e-camp! Help me!
... What does it
 all mean?” sc
reamed the doct
or’s wife.  
“Kindly let th
is cart pass. Do
n’t you see it
’s a woman?”
 said Prince An
drew riding up t
o the officer. 
 The officer gl
"anced at him, an"
d without replyi
ng turned again 
to the soldier.
 “I’ll teach
 you to push on!
... Back!”  
“Let them pass
", I tell you!”"
 repeated Prince
" Andrew, compres"
sing his lips. 
  “And who ar
e you?” cried 
"the officer, tur"
ning on him with
" tipsy
rage, �"
�who are you? Ar

 here? Eh? I am 
"commander here,"
 not you! Go bac
k or I’ll flat
ten you into a p
"ancake,” repea"
ted he. This ex
pression evident
ly pleased him. 
  “That was a
 nice snub for t
he little aide-d
"e-camp,” came "
a voice from be
hind.  Prince 
Andrew saw that 
the officer was 
in that state of
" senseless,
tip"
sy rage when a m
an does not know
 what he is sayi
ng. He saw that 
his championshi
p of the doctor�
��s wife in her 
queer trap might
 expose him to 
what he dreaded 
more than anythi
ng in the world�
��to ridicule; b
ut his instinct
 urged him on. B
efore the office
r finished his s
entence Prince 
"Andrew, his face"
 distorted with 
"fury, rode up to"
 him and raised 
 his riding whip
.  “Kind...l
y let—them—p
ass!”  The o
fficer flourishe
d his arm and ha
stily rode away.
  “It’s al
l the fault of t
hese fellows on 
the staff that t
here’s this d
"isorder,” he m"
uttered. “Do a
s you like.” 
 Prince Andrew 
without lifting 
his eyes rode ha
stily away from 
the doctor’s 
"wife, who was ca"
lling him her de
"liverer, and rec"
alling with a s
ense of disgust 
the minutest det

  On reaching 
the village he d
ismounted and we

"t house,
intend"
ing to rest if b
"ut for a moment,"
" eat something, "
and try to sort 
 out the stingin
g and tormenting
 thoughts that c
onfused his mind
. “This is a 
mob of scoundrel

nking as he went
 up to the wind

miliar voice cal
led him by name

 “Bolkónski!

 Andrew saw Nesv

 he had any new

�Where is the co

"��Well, is it tr"

 Nesvítski.  
“I was going t

"“And we, my de"

talking loudly t
"ogether, Prince"
 Andrew entered

looked worn—he
 too had evident
ly not slept all

 even nod to him

��One can’t wr

  Through the

"Immediately, Pri"

“What about ca

 “Nothing of

Prince Andrew mo

Kut"

“Well, good"

said he to Bagra

" he said, as if "
with an old man

 he understood a
ll that was pass
ing in Bolkónsk
i’s mind. “
If a tenth part 
of his detachmen
t returns I shal
"l thank God,”"
 he added as if 
speaking to hims
elf.  Prince A
ndrew glanced at
 Kutúzov’s fa
ce only a foot d
istant from him 
 and involuntari
ly noticed the c
arefully washed 
seams of the sca
r near his temp

"Yes, he has a ri"

calmly of those 
"men’s

�� thought Bolk�
�nski.  “Tha
t is why I beg t
o be sent to tha

 he said.  Kut
úzov did not re
ply. He seemed t
o have forgotten
 what he had bee
"n
saying, and s"
at plunged in th
ought. Five minu
"tes later, gentl"
y swaying on th
e soft springs o
"f the carriage, "
he turned to Pri
nce Andrew. The
re was not a tra
ce of agitation 
on his face. Wit
h delicate irony
 he questioned 
Prince Andrew ab
out the details 
of his interview
 with the Emper
"or, about the re"
marks he had hea
rd at court conc
erning the Krems
"
affair, and ab"
out some ladies 
they both knew. 
      CHAPT
ER XIV  On Nov
ember 1 Kutúzov
" had received, t"
"hrough a spy, ne"
ws that the army
 he commanded w
as in an almost 
hopeless positio
n. The spy repor
ted that the Fr
"ench, after cros"
sing the bridge 
"at Vienna, were "
advancing in im
mense force upon
 Kutúzov’s li
ne of communicat
ion with the tro
ops that were a
rriving from Rus
sia. If Kutúzov
 decided to rema
"in at Krems,
Na"
poleon’s army 
of one hundred a
nd fifty thousan
d men would cut 
him off complet
ely and surround
 his exhausted a
rmy of forty tho
"usand, and he
w"
ould find himsel
f in the positio
n of Mack at Ulm
. If Kutúzov de
cided to abando
n the road conne
cting him with t
he troops arrivi
"ng from Russia,"
 he would have t
o march with no 
road into unknow
n parts of the B
ohemian mountai
"ns, defending hi"
mself against su
perior forces of
 the enemy and 
abandoning all h
ope of a junctio
n with Buxhöwde
n. If Kutúzov d
ecided to retre
at along the roa
d from Krems to 
"Olmütz, to unit"
e with the troo
ps arriving from
" Russia, he risk"
ed being foresta
lled on that roa
d by the French
 who had crossed
 the Vienna brid
"ge, and encumber"
ed by his bagga
ge and transport
", having to acce"
pt battle on the
 march against a
n enemy three t
"imes as strong, "
who would hem hi
m in from two si
des.  Kutúzov
 chose this latt
er course.  Th
"e French, the sp"
"y reported, havi"
ng crossed the V
"ienna bridge, we"
re advancing by
 forced marches 
"toward Znaim, wh"
ich lay sixty-si
x miles off on 
the line of Kut�
�zov’s retreat
. If he reached 
Znaim before the
"
French, there "
would be great h
ope of saving th
e army; to let t
he French fores
tall him at Znai
m meant the expo
sure of his whol
e army to a dis
grace such as th
"at of Ulm, or to"
 utter destructi
on. But to fores
tall the French
 with his whole 
army was impossi
ble. The road fo
r the French fr
om Vienna to Zna
im was shorter a
nd better than t
he road for the 
 Russians from K
rems to Znaim. 
 The night he r
eceived the news
", Kutúzov sent "
Bagratión’s v
"anguard,
four t"
"housand strong, "
to the right acr
oss the hills fr
om the Krems-Zna
im to the Vienn
a-Znaim road. Ba
gratión was to 
make this march 
without resting
", and to halt fa"
cing Vienna with
 Znaim to his re
"ar, and if he
s"
ucceeded in fore
stalling the Fre
nch he was to de
lay them as long
 as possible. K
utúzov himself 
with all his tra
nsport took the 
road to Znaim. 
  Marching thir
ty miles that st
ormy night acros
s roadless hills
", with his
hung"
"ry, ill-shod sol"
"diers, and losin"
g a third of his
 men as straggle
"rs
by the way, "
Bagratión came 
out on the Vienn
a-Znaim road at 
Hollabrünn a f
ew hours ahead o
f the French who
 were approachin
g Hollabrünn fr
om Vienna. Kut�
�zov with his tr
ansport had stil
l to march for s
ome days before
 he could reach 
Znaim. Hence Bag
ratión with his
 four thousand 
"hungry, exhauste"
d men would have
 to detain for d
ays the whole en
emy army that c
ame upon him at 
"Hollabrünn, whi"
ch was clearly i
mpossible. But 
a freak of fate 
made the impossi
ble possible. Th
e success of the
 trick that had
 placed the Vien
na bridge in the
 hands of the Fr
ench without a 
fight led Murat 
to try to deceiv
e Kutúzov in a 
similar way. Mee
ting Bagratión
’s weak detach
ment on the Znai
m road he suppos
ed it to be Kut
úzov’s whole 
army. To be able
 to crush it abs
olutely he await
ed the arrival 
of the rest of t
he troops who we
re on their way 
"from Vienna,
an"
d with this obje
ct offered a thr
ee days’ truce
 on condition th
at both armies 
should remain in
 position withou
t moving. Murat 
declared that n
egotiations for 
peace were alrea
"dy proceeding, a"
nd that he ther
efore offered th
is truce to avoi
d unnecessary bl
oodshed. Count 
"Nostitz, the Aus"
trian general oc
cupying the adva
"nced posts, beli"
eved Murat’s 
emissary and ret
"ired, leaving Ba"
gratión’s div
ision exposed. 
Another emissary
 rode to the Rus
sian line to ann
ounce the peace 
 negotiations an
d to offer the R
ussian army the 
three days’ tr
uce. Bagratión
 replied that he
 was not authori
zed either to ac
cept or refuse 
a truce and sent
 his adjutant to
 Kutúzov to rep
ort the offer he
 had received. 
  A truce was K
utúzov’s sole
 chance of gaini
"ng time, giving"
 Bagratión’s 
exhausted troops
" some rest, and "
letting the tran
sport and heavy
 convoys (whose 
movements were c
oncealed from th
e French) advanc
e if but one st
age nearer Znaim
. The offer of a
 truce gave the 
"only, and
a qui"
"te unexpected, c"
hance of saving 
the army. On rec
eiving the news 
 he immediately 
dispatched Adjut
ant General Wint
"zingerode, who w"
as in attendanc
"e on him, to the"
 enemy camp. Win
tzingerode was n
ot merely to ag
ree to the truce
 but also to off
er terms of capi
"tulation, and
m"
eanwhile Kutúzo
v sent his adjut
ants back to has
ten to the utmos
t the movements
 of the baggage 
trains of the en
tire army along 
the Krems-Znaim 
 road. Bagratió
n’s exhausted 
and hungry detac
"hment, which alo"
ne covered this
 movement of the
 transport and o
f the whole army
", had to
remain"
 stationary in f
ace of an enemy 
eight times as s
trong as itself.
  Kutúzov’s
 expectations th
at the proposals
 of capitulation
 (which were in
 no way binding)
 might give time
 for part of the
 transport to pa
"ss,
and also th"
at Murat’s mis
take would very 
soon be discover
"ed, proved
corr"
ect. As soon as 
Bonaparte (who w
as at Schönbrun
"n, sixteen miles"
 from Hollabrü
nn) received Mur
at’s dispatch 
with the proposa
l of a truce an
d a capitulation
", he detected a "
ruse and wrote t
he following le
tter to Murat:

 CHAPTER XV  B
etween three and
 four o’clock 
in the afternoon
" Prince Andrew, "
who had persist
ed in his reques
"t to Kutúzov, a"
rrived at Grunth
 and reported h
imself to Bagrat
ión. Bonaparte�
��s adjutant had
 not yet reached
 Murat’s deta
chment and the b
attle had not ye
t begun. In Bagr
atión’s deta
chment no one kn
ew anything of t
he general posit
ion of affairs. 
They talked of 
peace but did no
t believe in its
 possibility; ot
hers talked of 
a battle but als
o disbelieved in
 the nearness of
 an engagement. 
"
Bagratión, kno"
wing Bolkónski 
to be a favorite
 and trusted adj
"utant,
received"
 him with distin
ction and specia
l marks of favor
", explaining to"
 him that there 
would probably b
e an engagement 
that day or the 
"next, and
givin"
g him full liber
ty to remain wit
h him during the
 battle or to jo
in the rearguar
d and have an ey
e on the order o
"f retreat, “wh"
ich is also ver
y important.” 
"

“However, t"
here will hardly
 be an engagemen
"t today,” said"
 Bagratión as 
if to reassure P
rince Andrew.  
 “If he is one
 of the ordinary
 little staff da
ndies sent to ea
rn a medal he c
an get his rewar
d just as well i
"n the rearguard,"
 but if he wish
es to stay with 
"me, let him... h"
e’ll be of use
 here if he’s 
a brave officer
",” thought Bag"
ratión. Prince 
"Andrew, without "
"replying,
asked"
 the prince’s 
permission to ri
de round the pos
ition to see the
 disposition of
" the forces, so "
as to know his b
earings should h
e be sent to ex
ecute an order. 
The officer on d
"uty, a handsome,"
 elegantly dress
ed man with a d
iamond ring on h
"is forefinger, w"
ho was fond of s
peaking French 
though he spoke 
"it badly, offere"
d to conduct Pri
nce Andrew.  O
n all sides they
 saw rain-soaked
 officers with d
ejected faces wh
o seemed to be 
seeking somethin
"g, and soldiers "
"dragging doors, "
"benches,
and fe"
ncing from the v
illage.  “Th
"ere now, Prince!"
 We can’t stop
" those fellows,�"
�� said the staf
f officer point
ing to the soldi
ers. “The offi
cers don’t kee
p them in hand.
" And there,” h"
e pointed to a s
"utler’s tent, "
“they crowd in
 and sit. This 
morning I turned
 them all out an
"d now look, it�"
�s full again. 
"I must go there,"
" Prince, and sca"
re them a bit. I
t won’t take a
 moment.”  
"“Yes, let’s "
go in and I will
 get myself a ro
ll and some chee
"se,”
said Pri"
nce Andrew who h
ad not yet had t
ime to eat anyth
ing.  “Why d
idn’t you ment
"ion it, Prince? "
I would have off
ered you someth
ing.”  They 
dismounted and e
ntered the tent.
 Several officer
"s, with flushed "
and weary faces
", were sitting a"
t the table eati
ng and drinking.
  “Now what 
"does this mean, "
gentlemen?” sa
id the staff off
"icer, in
the re"
proachful tone o
f a man who has 
repeated the sam
e thing more th
an once. “You 
know it won’t 
do to leave your
 posts like this
. The prince ga
ve orders that n
o one should lea
ve his post. Now
" you,
Captain,�"
�� and he turned
" to a thin, dirt"
y little artille
ry officer who 
without his boot
s (he had given 
them to the cant
een keeper to dr
"y),
in only his"
" stockings, rose"
 when they enter
"ed, smiling not "
altogether comf
ortably.  “W
"ell, aren’t yo"
u ashamed of you
"rself, Captain T"
úshin?” he c
ontinued. “One
 would think tha
t as an artiller
y officer you wo
uld set a good 
"example, yet her"
e you are withou
t your boots! Th
e alarm will be 
 sounded and you
’ll be in a pr
etty position wi
thout your boots
!” (The staff
 officer smiled.
) “Kindly retu
rn to your posts
", gentlemen, all"
" of
you, all!�"
� he added in a 
tone of command.
  Prince Andre
w smiled involun
tarily as he loo
ked at the artil
lery officer T�
"�shin, who silen"
"t and smiling, s"
hifting from one
 stockinged foot
" to
the other, "
glanced inquirin
gly with his lar
"ge, intelligent,"
 kindly eyes fr
om Prince Andrew
 to the staff of
ficer.  “The
 soldiers say it
 feels easier wi
"thout boots,” "
said Captain T�
�shin smiling sh
yly in his uncom
fortable positio
"n, evidently wis"
hing to adopt a
 jocular tone. B
ut before he had
 finished he fel
t that his jest
 was unacceptabl
e and had not co
me off. He grew 
confused.  “
Kindly return to
" your posts,” "
said the staff o
fficer trying to
 preserve his g
ravity.  Princ
e Andrew glanced
 again at the ar
tillery officer�
��s small figure
. There was som
ething peculiar 
"about it, quite "
"unsoldierly, rat"
"her comic,
but "
extremely attrac
tive.  The sta
ff officer and P
rince Andrew mou
nted their horse
s and rode on. 
 Having ridden 
beyond the villa
"ge, continually "
meeting and over
taking soldiers
 and officers of
 various regimen
"ts, they saw on "
their left some 
 entrenchments b
"eing thrown up, "
the freshly dug 
clay of which sh
owed up red. Se
veral battalions
" of soldiers, in"
 their shirt sle
eves despite th
"e cold wind, swa"
rmed in these ea
rthworks like a 
host of white an
ts; spadefuls o
f red clay were 
continually bein
g thrown up from
 behind the ban
k by unseen hand
s. Prince Andrew
 and the officer
" rode up, looked"
 at the entrenc
"hment, and went "
on again. Just b
ehind it they ca
me upon some do
zens of soldiers
", continually re"
placed by others
", who ran from t"
he entrenchment
. They had to ho
ld their noses a
nd put their hor
ses to a trot t
o escape from th
e poisoned atmos
phere of these l
atrines.  “V
oilà l’agrém
"ent des camps, m"
onsieur le princ
"e,” * said the"
 staff officer.
      * “Thi
s is a pleasure 
one gets in camp
", Prince.”

"
 They rode up t
he opposite hill
. From there the
 French could al
ready be seen. 
Prince Andrew st
opped and began 
examining the po
sition.  “Th
at’s our batte
"ry,” said the "
staff officer in
dicating the hi
ghest point. “
It’s in charge
 of the queer fe
llow we saw with
out his boots. 
You can see ever
ything from ther
e; let’s go th
"ere,
Prince.”"
  “Thank you
" very much, I wi"
"ll go on alone,�"
�� said Prince A
"ndrew,
wishing "
to rid himself o
f this staff off
icer’s company
", “please
don"
’t trouble you
rself further.�
�  The staff o
fficer remained 
behind and Princ
e Andrew rode on
 alone.  The f
arther forward a
nd nearer the en
"emy he went, the"
 more orderly an
d cheerful were
 the troops. The
 greatest disord
er and depressio
n had been in t
he baggage train
 he had passed t
hat morning on t
he Znaim road se
ven miles away 
from the French.
 At Grunth also 
some apprehensio
n and alarm cou
"ld be felt, but "
the nearer Princ
e Andrew came to
 the French line
s the more conf
ident was the ap
pearance of our 
troops. The sold
iers in their g
reatcoats were r
"anged in lines, "
the sergeants ma
jor and company 
 officers were c
"ounting the men,"
 poking the last
 man in each sec
tion in the rib
s and telling hi
m to hold his ha
nd up. Soldiers 
scattered over 
the whole place 
were dragging lo
gs and brushwood
 and were buildi
ng shelters wit
h merry chatter 
and laughter; ar
ound the fires s
"at others,
dres"
sed and undresse
"d, drying their "
shirts and leg b
ands or mending 
 boots or overco
ats and crowding
 round the boile
rs and porridge 
cookers. In one
 company dinner 
"was ready, and t"
he soldiers were
 gazing eagerly 
 at the steaming
" boiler, waiting"
 till the sample
", which a quarte"
rmaster sergean
t was carrying i
n a wooden bowl 
to an officer wh
o sat on a log 
before his shelt
"er, had been tas"
ted.  Another 
"company, a lucky"
 one for not all
 the companies h
"ad vodka,
crowd"
ed round a pockm
"arked, broad-sho"
uldered sergeant
" major who, tilt"
"ing
a keg, fill"
ed one after ano
ther the canteen
 lids held out t
o him. The sold
iers lifted the 
canteen lids to 
their lips with 
reverential face
"s,
emptied them"
", rolling the vo"
dka in their mou
"ths, and walked "
away from the s
ergeant major wi
th brightened ex
"pressions, licki"
ng their lips an
d wiping them o
n the sleeves of
 their greatcoat
s. All their fac
es were as sere
ne as if all thi
s were happening
 at home awaitin
g peaceful enca
"mpment, and not "
within sight of 
the enemy before
 an action in w
hich at least ha
lf of them would
 be left on the 
field. After pas
sing a chasseur
 regiment and in
 the lines of th
e Kiev grenadier
s—fine fellows
 busy with simi
lar peaceful aff
airs—near the 
shelter of the r
egimental comma
"nder, higher tha"
n and different 
"from the others,"
 Prince Andrew c
ame out in fron
t of a platoon o
f grenadiers bef
ore whom lay a n
aked man. Two s
oldiers held him
 while two other
s were flourishi
ng their switche
s and striking 
him regularly on
 his bare back. 
The man shrieked
 unnaturally. A
 stout major was
 pacing up and d
"own the line, an"
d regardless of 
the screams kep
t repeating:  
“It’s a sham
e for a soldier 
to steal; a sold
ier must be hone
"st,
honorable, "
"and brave, but i"
f he robs his fe
llows there is n
"o honor in
him,"
 he’s a scound
rel. Go on! Go o
n!”  So the 
swishing sound o
"f the strokes, a"
nd the desperate
 but unnatural 
"screams, continu"
"ed.

“Go on,"
 go on!” said 
the major.  A 
young officer wi
th a bewildered 
and pained expre
ssion on his fac
e stepped away 
from the man and
 looked round in
quiringly at the
 adjutant as he
 rode by.  Pri
"nce Andrew, havi"
ng reached the f
"ront line, rode "
along it. Our fr
ont line and th
at of the enemy 
were far apart o
n the right and 
"left flanks,
bu"
t in the center 
where the men wi
th a flag of tru
ce had passed th
"at
morning, the"
 lines were so n
ear together tha
t the men could 
see one another
’s faces and s
peak to one anot
her. Besides the
 soldiers who f
ormed the picket
 line on either 
"side, there were"
 many curious on
"lookers
who, je"
sting and laughi
"ng, stared at th"
eir strange fore
ign enemies.  
Since early morn
ing—despite an
 injunction not 
to approach the 
picket line—t
he officers had 
been unable to k
eep sight-seers 
away. The soldi
ers forming the 
"picket line, lik"
e showmen exhibi
ting a curiosity
",
no longer loo"
ked at the Frenc
h but paid atten
tion to the sigh
t-seers and gre
w weary waiting 
to be relieved. 
Prince Andrew ha
lted to have a l
ook at the Fren
ch.  “Look! 
Look there!” o
ne soldier was s
aying to another
", pointing to a"
 Russian muskete
er who had gone 
up to the picket
 line with an of
ficer and was r
apidly and excit
edly talking to 
a French grenadi
er. “Hark to h
im jabbering! F
"ine, isn’t it?"
 It’s all the 
Frenchy can do t
o keep up with 
"him. There now, "
Sídorov!”  
“Wait a bit an
d listen. It’s
 fine!” answer
"ed Sídorov, who"
 was considered
 an adept at Fre
nch.  The sold
ier to whom the 
laughers referre
d was Dólokhov.
 Prince Andrew 
recognized him a
nd stopped to li
sten to what he 
was saying. Dól
okhov had come 
from the left fl
ank where their 
regiment was sta
"tioned, with
hi"
s captain.  �
"�Now then, go on"
", go on!” inci"
"ted the officer,"
 bending forward
 and trying not
 to lose a word 
of the speech wh
ich was incompre
hensible to him
". “More, pleas"
e: more! What’
s he saying?” 
  Dólokhov did
 not answer the 
captain; he had 
been drawn into 
a hot dispute w
ith the French g
renadier. They w
ere naturally ta
lking about the 
 campaign. The F
"renchman, confus"
ing the Austrian
s with the Russi
"ans, was
trying"
 to prove that t
he Russians had 
surrendered and 
had fled all th
"e way from Ulm, "
while Dólokhov 
maintained that 
the Russians had
 not surrendere
d but had beaten
 the French.  
“We have order
s to drive you o
"ff here, and we "
shall drive you 
"off,”
said D�"
�lokhov.  “O
nly take care yo
u and your Cossa
cks are not all 
captured!” sai
d the French gr
enadier.  The 
French onlookers
 and listeners l
aughed.  “We
’ll make you d
ance as we did u
nder Suvórov...
",” * said
Dó"

t the only thing

 guns remained l
"oaded, the looph"
oles in blockhou
ses and entrenc
hments looked ou
t just as menaci
"ngly, and the un"
limbered cannon 
 confronted one 
another as befor
e.      CH
APTER XVI  Hav
ing ridden round
 the whole line 
from right flank
" to left, Prince"
 Andrew made hi
s way up to the 
battery from whi
ch the staff off
icer had told h
im the whole fie
ld could be seen
. Here he dismou
"nted, and stoppe"
d beside the fa
rthest of the fo
ur unlimbered ca
nnon. Before the
 guns an artill
ery sentry was p
acing up and dow
n; he stood at a
ttention when th
e officer arriv
"ed, but at a sig"
n resumed his me
"asured, monotono"
us pacing. Behi
nd the guns were
 their limbers a
nd still farther
 back picket rop
es and artiller
ymen’s bonfire
"s. To the left, "
not far from the
 farthest canno
"n, was a small, "
newly constructe
d wattle shed fr
om which came th
e sound of offi
cers’ voices i
n eager conversa
tion.  It was 
true that a view
 over nearly the
 whole Russian p
osition and the 
 greater part of
 the enemy’s o
pened out from t
his battery. Jus
"t facing
it, on"
 the crest of th
"e opposite hill,"
 the village of 
Schön Grabern 
"could be seen, a"
nd in three plac
es to left and r
ight the French 
troops amid the
 smoke of their 
"campfires, the g"
reater part of w
hom were eviden
tly in the villa
ge itself and be
hind the hill. T
o the left from 
"
that village, a"
"mid the smoke, w"
as something res
embling a batter
"y, but it
was i"
mpossible to see
 it clearly with
 the naked eye. 
Our right flank 
was posted on a
 rather steep in
cline which domi
nated the French
 position. Our 
infantry were st
"ationed there, a"
nd at the farthe
st point the dr
agoons. In the c
"enter, where Tú"
shin’s battery
 stood and from 
which Prince An
drew was surveyi
"ng the position,"
 was the easiest
 and most direc
t descent and as
cent to the broo
k separating us 
from Schön Gra
bern. On the lef
t our troops wer
e close to a cop
"se, in which smo"
ked the bonfire
s of our infantr
y who were felli
ng wood. The Fre
nch line was wi
"der than ours, a"
nd it was plain 
that they could 
easily outflank 
us on both side
s. Behind our po
sition was a ste
"ep and deep dip,"
 making it diff
icult for artill
ery and cavalry 
to retire. Princ
e Andrew took o
ut his notebook 
"and, leaning on "
"the cannon, sket"
ched a plan of t
he position. He
 made some notes
" on two points, "
intending to men
tion them to Ba
gratión. His id
"ea was, first, t"
o concentrate al
l the artillery 
"in the
center, "
"and secondly, to"
 withdraw the ca
valry to the oth
er side of the 
dip. Prince Andr
"ew, being always"
 near the comman
"der in chief, cl"
osely following
 the mass moveme
nts and general 
"orders, and cons"
tantly studying 
 historical acco
"unts of battles,"
 involuntarily p
ictured to himse
lf the course o
f events in the 
forthcoming acti
on in broad outl
ine. He imagine
d only important
 possibilities: 
“If the enemy 
attacks the righ
"t
flank,” he "
"said to himself,"
 “the Kiev gre
nadiers and the 
Podólsk chasse
urs must hold th
eir position til
l reserves from 
the center come
 up. In that cas
e the dragoons c
ould successfull
y make a flank 
counterattack. I
f they attack ou
"r center we, hav"
ing the center b
attery on this 
"high ground, sha"
ll withdraw the 
left flank under
" its cover, and"
 retreat to the 
dip by echelons.
” So he reason
ed.... All the t
ime he had been
" beside the gun,"
 he had heard th
e voices of the 
officers distin
"ctly, but as oft"
en happens had n
ot understood a 
word of what the
y were saying. 
"Suddenly, howeve"
"r, he was struck"
 by a voice comi
ng from the she
"d, and its tone "
was so sincere t
hat he could not
 but listen.  
"“No, friend,�"
� said a pleasan
"t and, as it see"
med to Prince An
"drew, a
familia"
"r voice, “what"
 I say is that i
f it were possib
le to know what
 is beyond death
", none of us wou"
ld be afraid of 
"it. That’s so,"
 friend.”  
"Another, a young"
"er voice, interr"
upted him: “Af
"raid or not, you"
 can’t escape
 it anyhow.” 
 “All the sam
"e, one is afraid"
"! Oh, you clever"
" people,” said"
 a third manly 
voice interrupti
ng them both. �
�Of course you a
rtillery men are
"
very wise, bec"
ause you can tak
e everything alo
ng with you—vo
dka and snacks.
”  And the o
wner of the manl
"y voice, evident"
ly an infantry o
"fficer,
laughed"
".

“Yes, one"
" is afraid,” c"
ontinued the fir
"st speaker, he o"
f the familiar 
voice. “One is
 afraid of the u
"nknown, that’s"
 what it is. Wh
atever we may sa
y about the soul
 going to the sk
y... we know the
re is no sky bu
t only an atmosp
here.”  The 
manly voice agai
n interrupted th
e artillery offi
"cer.

“Well,"
 stand us some o
f your herb vodk
"a, Túshin,” i"
t said.  “Wh
"y,” thought Pr"
"ince Andrew, “"
that’s the cap
tain who stood u
p in the sutler
’s hut without
 his boots.” H
e recognized the
" agreeable,
phi"
losophizing voic
e with pleasure.
  “Some herb
 vodka? Certainl
y!” said Túsh
in. “But still
", to
conceive a"
 future life...�
��  He did not
 finish. Just th
en there was a w
histle in the ai
r; nearer and n
"earer, faster an"
"d louder, louder"
" and faster, a c"
"annon ball, as i"
f it had not fi
nished saying wh
at was necessary
", thudded into t"
he ground near 
the shed with su
"per human force,"
 throwing up a m
ass of earth. Th
e ground seemed
 to groan at the
 terrible impact
.  And immedia
"tely Túshin, wi"
th a short pipe 
in the corner of
 his mouth and 
"his kind, intell"
igent face rathe
"r pale, rushed o"
ut of the shed 
followed by the 
owner of the man
"ly voice, a dash"
ing infantry off
icer who hurrie
d off to his com
"pany, buttoning "
up his coat as h
e ran.     
 CHAPTER XVII 
 Mounting his h
orse again Princ
e Andrew lingere
d with the batte
"ry,
looking at "
the puff from th
e gun that had s
ent the ball. Hi
s eyes ran rapi
dly over the wid
"e space, but he "
only saw that th
e hitherto moti
onless masses of
 the French now 
swayed and that 
there really was
 a battery to t
heir left. The s
moke above it ha
d not yet disper
sed. Two mounte
"d Frenchmen, pro"
"bably adjutants,"
 were galloping 
up the hill. A 
small but distin
ctly visible ene
my column was mo
ving down the hi
"ll,
probably to"
 strengthen the 
front line. The 
smoke of the fir
st shot had not
 yet dispersed b
efore another pu
"ff appeared, fol"
lowed by a repor
t. The battle h
ad begun! Prince
 Andrew turned h
is horse and gal
loped back to G
runth to find Pr
ince Bagratión.
 He heard the ca
nnonade behind h
im growing loud
er and more freq
uent. Evidently 
our guns had beg
un to reply. Fr
om the bottom of
" the slope, wher"
e the parleys ha
"d taken place, c"
ame the report 
of musketry.  
Lemarrois had ju
st arrived at a 
gallop with Bona
parte’s stern 
"letter,
and Mur"
"at, humiliated a"
nd anxious to ex
"piate his fault,"
 had at once mo
ved his forces t
o attack the cen
ter and outflank
 both the Russia
"n
wings, hoping"
 before evening 
and before the a
rrival of the Em
peror to crush 
the contemptible
 detachment that
 stood before hi
m.  “It has 
begun. Here it i
s!” thought Pr
"ince Andrew, fee"
ling the blood 
rush to his hear
t. “But where 
and how will my 
Toulon present 
itself?”  Pa
ssing between th
e companies that
 had been eating
 porridge and dr
inking vodka a 
quarter of an ho
"ur before, he sa"
w everywhere the
 same rapid mov
ement of soldier
s forming ranks 
and getting thei
"r muskets ready,"
 and on all the
ir faces he reco
gnized the same 
eagerness that f
illed his heart
. “It has begu
"n! Here it is, d"
readful but enjo
yable!” was wh
at the face of 
each soldier and
 each officer se
emed to say.  
Before he had re
ached the embank
ments that were 
"being thrown up,"
" he saw,
in the"
 light of the du
ll autumn evenin
"g, mounted men c"
oming toward him
".
The foremost,"
 wearing a Cossa
ck cloak and lam
bskin cap and ri
ding a white ho
"rse, was Prince "
Bagratión. Prin
ce Andrew stoppe
"d, waiting for
"
him to come up; 
Prince Bagratió
n reined in his 
horse and recogn
izing Prince An
drew nodded to h
im. He still loo
ked ahead while 
Prince Andrew t
old him what he 
had seen.  The
" feeling, “It "
has begun! Here 
it is!” was se
en even on Princ
e Bagratión’
s hard brown fac
e with its half-
"closed, dull, sl"
eepy eyes. Prin
ce Andrew gazed 
with anxious cur
iosity at that i
mpassive face a
nd wished he cou
"ld tell what, if"
" anything, this "
man was thinking
 and feeling at
 that moment. �
�Is there anythi
ng at all behind
 that impassive
 face?” Prince
 Andrew asked hi
mself as he look
ed. Prince Bagr
atión bent his 
head in sign of 
agreement with w
hat Prince Andre
"w
told him, and"
" said, “Very g"
ood!” in a ton
e that seemed to
 imply that eve
rything that too
k place and was 
reported to him 
was exactly what
 he had foresee
n. Prince Andrew
", out of breath "
with his rapid r
"ide, spoke
quic"
kly. Prince Bagr
"atión, uttering"
 his words with 
an Oriental acce
"nt,
spoke parti"
"cularly slowly, "
as if to impress
 the fact that t
here was no nee
d to hurry. Howe
"ver, he put his "
horse to a trot 
in the direction
 of Túshin’s
 battery. Prince
 Andrew followed
 with the suite.
 Behind Prince 
Bagratión rode 
an officer of th
"e suite, the pri"
nce’s personal
"
adjutant, Zher"
"kóv, an orderly"
" officer, the st"
aff officer on d
"uty,
riding a f"
ine bobtailed ho
"rse, and a civil"
ian—an account
ant who had ask
ed permission to
 be present at t
he battle out of
 curiosity. The 
"
accountant, a s"
"tout, full-faced"
" man, looked aro"
und him with a n
aïve smile of 
satisfaction and
 presented a str
ange appearance 
among the hussa
"rs, Cossacks, an"
"d adjutants, in "
"his camlet coat,"
 as he jolted on
 his horse with
 a convoy office
r’s saddle.  
 “He wants to 
"see a battle,”"
 said Zherkóv t
"o Bolkónski, po"
inting to the a
"ccountant, “bu"
t he feels a pai
n in the pit of 
his stomach alr
eady.”  “O
"h, leave off!”"
 said the accoun
tant with a beam
ing but rather 
"cunning smile, a"
s if flattered a
t being made the
 subject of Zher
"kóv’s
joke, "
and purposely tr
ying to appear s
tupider than he 
really was.  �
��It is very str
"ange, mon Monsie"
"ur Prince,” sa"
id the staff off
icer. (He remem
bered that in Fr
ench there is so
me peculiar way 
of addressing a 
"
prince, but cou"
ld not get it qu
ite right.)  B
y this time they
 were all approa
ching Túshin’
"s battery, and a"
 ball struck th
e ground in fron
t of them.  �
�What’s that t
hat has fallen?�
�� asked the acc
ountant with a n
aïve smile.  
 “A French pan
"cake,” answere"
d Zherkóv.  �
��So that’s wh
at they hit with
?” asked the a
ccountant. “Ho
w awful!”  
He seemed to swe
ll with satisfac
tion. He had har
dly finished spe
aking when they
 again heard an 
unexpectedly vio
lent whistling w
hich suddenly e
nded with a thud
 into something 
soft... f-f-flop
"! and a Cossack,"
 riding a littl
e to their right
 and behind the 
"accountant, cras"
hed to earth wit
h his horse. Zh
erkóv and the s
taff officer ben
t over their sad
dles and turned
 their horses aw
ay. The accounta
"nt stopped, faci"
"ng the Cossack,"
 and examined hi
m with attentive
 curiosity. The 
Cossack was dead
", but the
horse"
 still struggled
.  Prince Bagr
atión screwed u
"p his eyes, look"
"ed round, and, s"
eeing the cause
 of the confusio
"n, turned away w"
ith indifference
", as if to say,"
 “Is it worth 
while noticing t
rifles?” He re
ined in his hors
e with the care
 of a skillful r
"ider and, slight"
"ly bending over,"
 disengaged his 
 saber which had
 caught in his c
loak. It was an 
old-fashioned sa
ber of a kind n
o longer in gene
ral use. Prince 
Andrew remembere
d the story of 
Suvórov giving 
his saber to Bag
ratión in Italy
", and the recoll"
ection was part
icularly pleasan
t at that moment
. They had reach
ed the battery 
at which Prince 
Andrew had been 
when he examined
 the battlefield
.  “Whose co
mpany?” asked 
Prince Bagratió
n of an artiller
yman standing b
y the ammunition
 wagon.  He as
"ked, “Whose co"
mpany?” but he
" really meant, �"
��Are you frigh
tened here?” a
nd the artillery
man understood h
im.  “Captai
"n Túshin’s, y"
our excellency!�
�� shouted the r
"ed-haired,
frec"
kled gunner in a
" merry voice, st"
anding to attent
"ion.

“Yes, "
"yes,” muttered"
 Bagratión as i
f considering so
"mething, and he"
 rode past the l
imbers to the fa
rthest cannon. 
 As he approach
"ed, a ringing sh"
ot issued from i
t deafening him 
"and his
suite, "
and in the smoke
 that suddenly s
urrounded the gu
n they could see
 the gunners wh
o had seized it 
straining to rol
l it quickly bac
k to its former
 position. A hug
"e, broad-shoulde"
"red gunner, Numb"
"er One, holding"
"
a mop, his legs"
" far apart, spra"
ng to the wheel;
 while Number Tw
o with a trembl
ing hand placed 
a charge in the 
cannon’s mouth
". The short,
ro"
und-shouldered C
"aptain Túshin, "
stumbling over t
he tail of the g
"un
carriage, mo"
"ved forward and,"
 not noticing th
"e general, looke"
d out shading h
is eyes with his
 small hand.  
“Lift it two l
ines more and it
 will be just ri
"ght,” cried he"
 in a feeble vo
ice to which he 
tried to impart 
"a dashing note, "
ill-suited to h
is weak figure. 
“Number Two!�
� he squeaked. �
"��Fire, Medvéde"
v!”  Bagrati
ón called to hi
"m, and Túshin, "
raising three fi
ngers to his cap
 with a bashful
 and awkward ges
ture not at all 
like a military 
salute but like
 a priest’s be
"nediction, appro"
ached the genera
l. Though Túsh
in’s guns had 
been intended to
 cannonade the v
"alley, he was
f"
iring incendiary
 balls at the vi
llage of Schön 
Grabern visible 
"just
opposite, "
in front of whic
h large masses o
f French were ad
vancing.  No o
ne had given Tú
shin orders wher
e and at what to
" fire, but after"
 consulting his
" sergeant major,"
" Zakharchénko, "
for whom he had 
"great
respect, "
he had decided t
hat it would be 
a good thing to 
set fire to the 
 village. “Ver
y good!” said 
Bagratión in re
ply to the offic
"er’s
report, "
and began delibe
rately to examin
e the whole batt
lefield extended
 before him. Th
e French had adv
anced nearest on
 our right. Belo
w the height on
 which the Kiev 
regiment was sta
"tioned, in the h"
ollow where the 
"
rivulet flowed,"
 the soul-stirri
ng rolling and c
rackling of musk
"etry was
heard,"
 and much farthe
r to the right b
eyond the dragoo
"ns, the officer "
of the suite po
inted out to Bag
ratión a French
 column that was
 outflanking us
. To the left th
e horizon bounde
d by the adjacen
t wood. Prince 
Bagratión order
ed two battalion
s from the cente
r to be sent to 
 reinforce the r
ight flank. The 
officer of the s
uite ventured to
 remark to the 
prince that if t
hese battalions 
"went away, the g"
uns would remain
 without suppor
t. Prince Bagrat
ión turned to t
he officer and w
ith his dull ey
es looked at him
 in silence. It 
seemed to Prince
 Andrew that the
 officer’s re
mark was just an
d that really no
 answer could be
 made to it. Bu
t at that moment
 an adjutant gal
loped up with a 
message from the
 commander of t
he regiment in t
he hollow and ne
ws that immense 
masses of the F
rench were comin
g down upon them
 and that his re
giment was in d
isorder and was 
retreating upon 
the Kiev grenadi
ers. Prince Bagr
atión bowed hi
s head in sign o
f assent and app
roval. He rode o
ff at a walk to 
 the right and s
ent an adjutant 
to the dragoons 
with orders to a
ttack the Frenc
h. But this adju
tant returned ha
lf an hour later
 with the news t
hat the command
er of the dragoo
ns had already r
etreated beyond 
the dip in the 
"ground, as a hea"
vy fire had been
 opened on him a
nd he was losing
"
men uselessly,"
 and so had hast
ened to throw so
me sharpshooters
 into the wood.
  “Very good
!” said Bagrat
ión.  As he w
as leaving the b
"attery, firing w"
as heard on the 
"left also, and
"
as it was too fa
r to the left fl
ank for him to h
ave time to go t
"here
himself, P"
rince Bagratión
 sent Zherkóv t
o tell the gener
al in command (
the one who had 
paraded his regi
ment before Kut�
�zov at Braunau)
 that he must r
etreat as quickl
y as possible be
hind the hollow 
"in the rear,
as"
 the right flank
 would probably 
not be able to w
ithstand the ene
my’s attack v
ery long. About 
Túshin and the 
battalion that h
ad been in supp
ort of his batte
ry all was forgo
tten. Prince And
rew listened at
tentively to Bag
ratión’s coll
oquies with the 
commanding offic
ers and the ord
ers he gave them
" and, to his sur"
"prise, found tha"
t no orders wer
"e really given, "
but that Prince 
Bagratión tried
 to make it appe
ar that everyth
ing done by nece
"ssity, by accide"
"nt, or by the wi"
ll of subordina
te commanders wa
"s done, if not b"
y his direct com
"mand, at least
"
in accord with h
is intentions. P
rince Andrew not
"iced, however, t"
hat though what
 happened was du
e to chance and 
was independent 
of the commande
"r’s will, owin"
g to the tact Ba
"gratión showed,"
 his presence w
as very valuable
. Officers who a
pproached him wi
th disturbed co
untenances becam
e calm; soldiers
 and officers gr
"eeted him gaily,"
 grew more chee
rful in his pres
"ence, and were e"
vidently anxious
 to display the
ir courage befor
e him.     
 CHAPTER XVIII 
  Prince Bagrat
"ión, having rea"
ched the highest
 point of our ri
"ght flank,
bega"
n riding downhil
l to where the r
oll of musketry 
was heard but wh
ere on account 
of the smoke not
hing could be se
en. The nearer t
hey got to the 
hollow the less 
they could see b
ut the more they
 felt the nearne
ss of the actua
l battlefield. T
hey began to mee
t wounded men. O
ne with a bleed
ing head and no 
cap was being dr
agged along by t
wo soldiers who 
 supported him u
nder the arms. T
here was a gurgl
e in his throat 
and he was spit
ting blood. A bu
llet had evident
ly hit him in th
e throat or mou
th. Another was 
walking sturdily
 by himself but 
without his musk
"et,
groaning al"
oud and swinging
 his arm which h
ad just been hur
"t, while
blood "
from it was stre
aming over his g
reatcoat as from
 a bottle. He ha
d that moment b
een wounded and 
his face showed 
fear rather than
 suffering. Cro
ssing a road the
y descended a st
eep incline and 
saw several men 
 lying on the gr
ound; they also 
met a crowd of s
oldiers some of 
whom were unwou
nded. The soldie
rs were ascendin
g the hill breat
"hing heavily, an"
d despite the g
eneral’s prese
nce were talking
 loudly and gest
iculating. In f
ront of them row
s of gray cloaks
 were already vi
sible through th
"e
smoke, and an"
 officer catchin
g sight of Bagra
tión rushed sho
uting after the
 crowd of retrea
"ting soldiers, o"
rdering them bac
k. Bagratión ro
de up to the ra
nks along which 
shots crackled n
ow here and now 
"there, drowning"
 the sound of vo
ices and the sho
uts of command. 
The whole air re
eked with smoke
. The excited fa
ces of the soldi
ers were blacken
ed with it. Some
 were using the
"ir ramrods, othe"
rs putting powde
r on the touchpa
ns or taking ch
arges from their
" pouches, while "
others were firi
"ng, though who
"
they were firing
 at could not be
 seen for the sm
oke which there 
was no wind to 
carry away. A pl
easant humming a
nd whistling of 
bullets were of
ten heard. “Wh
at is this?” t
hought Prince An
drew approaching
 the crowd of s
oldiers. “It c
an’t be an att
"ack, for they ar"
e not moving; i
t can’t be a s
quare—for they
 are not drawn u
p for that.” 
 The commander 
"of the regiment,"
" a thin, feeble-"
looking old man 
with a pleasant
 smile—his eye
lids drooping mo
re than half ove
"r his old eyes,"
 giving him a mi
"ld expression, r"
ode up to Bagrat
ión and welcome
d him as a host
 welcomes an hon
ored guest. He r
eported that his
 regiment had b
een attacked by 
French cavalry a
"nd that, though "
the attack had b
"een
repulsed, h"
e had lost more 
than half his me
n. He said the a
ttack had been 
"repulsed, employ"
ing this militar
y term to descri
be what had occ
urred to his reg
"iment, but in re"
ality he did not
 himself know wh
at had happened
 during that hal
f-hour to the tr
oops entrusted t
"o him, and
coul"
d not say with c
ertainty whether
 the attack had 
been repulsed or
 his regiment h
ad been broken u
p. All he knew w
as that at the c
ommencement of 
the action balls
 and shells bega
n flying all ove
r his regiment a
nd hitting men 
and that afterwa
rds someone had 
shouted “Caval
ry!” and our 
men had begun fi
ring. They were 
"still firing, no"
t at the cavalry
 which had disa
"ppeared, but at "
French infantry 
who had come int
o the hollow an
d were firing at
 our men. Prince
 Bagratión bowe
d his head as a 
 sign that this 
was exactly what
 he had desired 
and expected. Tu
rning to his ad
jutant he ordere
d him to bring d
own the two batt
alions of the S
ixth Chasseurs w
hom they had jus
t passed. Prince
 Andrew was stru
ck by the chang
ed expression on
 Prince Bagrati�
�n’s face at t
his moment. It 
expressed the co
ncentrated and h
appy resolution 
you see on the f
ace of a man wh
o on a hot day t
akes a final run
 before plunging
 into the water.
"
The dull, slee"
py expression wa
s no longer ther
"e, nor the affec"
tation of profo
und thought. The
" round, steady, "
hawk’s eyes lo
oked before him 
 eagerly and rat
her disdainfully
", not resting on"
 anything althou
gh his movement
s were still slo
w and measured. 
  The commander
 of the regiment
 turned to Princ
"e Bagratión, en"
treating him to
 go back as it w
as too dangerous
 to remain where
 they were. “
"Please, your exc"
"ellency, for God"
’s sake!” he
" kept saying,
g"
lancing for supp
ort at an office
r of the suite w
ho turned away 
from him. “The
"re, you see!” "
and he drew atte
ntion to the bul
"lets
whistling,"
" singing, and hi"
ssing continuall
y around them. H
e spoke in the 
tone of entreaty
 and reproach th
at a carpenter u
ses to a gentlem
an who has pick
ed up an ax: “
We are used to i
"t, but you, sir,"
 will blister y
our hands.” He
 spoke as if tho
se bullets could
" not kill him, a"
nd his half-clo
sed eyes gave st
ill more persuas
iveness to his w
ords. The staff 
 officer joined 
in the colonel�
"�s appeals, but "
Bagratión did n
ot reply; he on
ly gave an order
 to cease firing
" and re-form, so"
 as to give room
 for the two ap
proaching battal
ions. While he w
"as speaking, the"
 curtain of smo
ke that had conc
ealed the hollow
", driven by a ri"
"sing wind, began"
 to move from r
ight to left as 
if drawn by an i
"nvisible hand, a"
nd the hill opp
"osite, with the "
French moving ab
"out on it, opene"
d out before th
em. All eyes fas
tened involuntar
ily on this Fren
ch column advanc
ing against the
m and winding do
wn over the unev
en ground. One c
ould already se
e the soldiers�
"� shaggy caps, d"
istinguish the o
fficers from the
" men,
and see t"
he standard flap
ping against its
 staff.  “Th
ey march splendi
"dly,” remarked"
 someone in Bagr
atión’s suite
.  The head of
 the column had 
already descende
d into the hollo
w. The clash wo
uld take place o
n this side of i
t...  The rema
ins of our regim
ent which had be
en in action rap
idly formed up 
and moved to the
 right; from beh
"ind it, dispersi"
"ng the laggards,"
 came two batta
lions of the Six
th Chasseurs in 
fine order. Befo
re they had rea
"ched Bagratión,"
 the weighty tre
ad of the mass o
f men marching i
n step could be
 heard. On their
" left flank, nea"
rest to Bagrati�
"�n, marched
a c"
ompany commander
", a fine round-f"
"aced man, with a"
 stupid and happ
y expression—
the same man who
 had rushed out 
of the wattle sh
ed. At that mom
ent he was clear
ly thinking of n
othing but how d
ashing a fellow 
he would appear
 as he passed th
e commander.  
With the self-sa
tisfaction of a 
"man on parade, h"
e stepped lightl
y with his musc
ular legs as if 
"sailing along, s"
tretching himsel
f to his full h
eight without th
e smallest effor
"t, his ease cont"
rasting with the
 heavy tread of
 the soldiers wh
o were keeping s
tep with him. He
 carried close 
to his leg a nar
row unsheathed s
"word (small, cur"
"ved, and not lik"
e a real weapon
) and looked now
 at the superior
 officers and no
w back at the me
n without losin
"g step, his whol"
e powerful body 
turning flexibly
. It was as if 
all the powers o
f his soul were 
concentrated on 
passing the comm
ander in the be
st possible mann
"er, and feeling "
that he was doin
g it well he wa
s happy. “Left
... left... left
...” he seemed
 to repeat to hi
mself at each a
lternate step; a
nd in time to th
"is, with stern b"
ut varied faces
", the wall of so"
ldiers burdened 
with knapsacks a
nd muskets march
"ed
in step, and"
 each one of the
se hundreds of s
oldiers seemed t
o be repeating 
to himself at ea
ch alternate ste
"p, “Left... le"

� A fat major sk
"irted a bush, pu"
ffing and fallin
g out of step; 
a soldier who ha
"d fallen behind,"
 his face showin
g alarm at his 
"defection, ran a"
"t a trot, pantin"
g to catch up wi
th his company. 
"A cannon
ball, "
cleaving the air
", flew over the "
heads of Bagrati
ón and his suit
"e,
and fell int"
o the column to 
the measure of �
��Left... left!�
�� “Close up!
” came the com
pany commander�
�s voice in jaun
ty tones. The s
oldiers passed i
n a semicircle r
ound something w
here the ball ha
"d
fallen, and a"
n old trooper on
" the flank, a no"
ncommissioned of
ficer who had s
topped beside th
"e dead men, ran "
to catch up his 
"line and, fallin"
g into step wit
"h a hop, looked "
"back angrily, an"
d through the om
inous silence a
nd the regular t
ramp of feet bea
ting the ground 
"in unison, one
"
seemed to hear l
eft... left... l
eft.  “Well 
"done, lads!” s"
aid Prince Bagra
tión.  “Gla
d to do our best
", your ex’len-"
lency!” came a
 confused shout 
 from the ranks.
 A morose soldie
r marching on th
e left turned hi
s eyes on Bagra
tión as he shou
"ted, with an exp"
ression that see
med to say: “W
e know that our
selves!” Anoth
"er, without look"
"ing round, as th"
ough fearing to
" relax, shouted "
with his mouth w
ide open and pas
sed on.  The o
rder was given t
o halt and down 
knapsacks.  Ba
gratión rode ro
und the ranks th
at had marched p
ast him and dis
mounted. He gave
 the reins to a 
"Cossack, took of"
f and handed ove
r his felt coat
", stretched his "
"legs, and set hi"
s cap straight. 
The head of the 
"
French column, "
with its officer
"s leading, appea"
red from below t
he hill.  “F
"orward, with God"
!” said Bagrat
"ión, in a resol"
"ute, sonorous vo"
"ice,
turning fo"
r a moment to th
"e front line, an"
d slightly swing
"ing his arms,
h"
e went forward u
neasily over the
 rough field wit
h the awkward ga
it of a cavalry
man. Prince Andr
ew felt that an 
invisible power 
was leading him 
"
forward, and ex"
perienced great 
happiness.  Th
e French were al
ready near. Prin
"ce Andrew, walki"
ng beside Bagrat
"ión,
could cle"
arly distinguish
 their bandolier
"s, red epaulets,"
 and even their 
 faces. (He dist
inctly saw an ol
d French officer
" who, with gaite"
red legs and tu
"rned-out toes, c"
limbed the hill 
with difficulty.
) Prince Bagrat
ión gave no fur
ther orders and 
silently continu
ed to walk on in
 front of the r
anks. Suddenly o
ne shot after an
other rang out f
"rom the
French,"
 smoke appeared 
all along their 
"uneven ranks, an"
d musket shots 
sounded. Several
 of our men fell
", among them the"
 round-faced off
icer who had ma
rched so gaily a
nd complacently.
 But at the mome
nt the first re
"port was heard, "
Bagratión looke
d round and shou
"ted, “Hurrah!�"
��  “Hurrah�
��ah!—ah!” r
ang a long-drawn
 shout from our 
"ranks, and
pass"
ing Bagratión a
nd racing one an

d eager crowd do
wn the hill at t
heir disordered 
foe.      
CHAPTER XIX  T
he attack of the
 Sixth Chasseurs
 secured the ret
reat of our righ
t flank. In the
 center Túshin�
��s forgotten ba
"ttery, which had"
 managed to set
 fire to the Sch
ön Grabern vill
"age, delayed the"
 French advance.
 The French wer
e putting out th
e fire which the
 wind was spread
"ing, and thus
g"
ave us time to r
etreat. The reti
rement of the ce
nter to the othe
r side of the d
ip in the ground
 at the rear was
 hurried and noi
"sy, but the
dif"
ferent companies
 did not get mix
ed. But our left
—which consist
ed of the Azóv
 and Podólsk in
fantry and the P
ávlograd hussar
s—was simulta
neously attacked
 and outflanked 
by superior Fren
ch forces under 
 Lannes and was 
thrown into conf
usion. Bagratió
n had sent Zherk
óv to the gene
ral commanding t
hat left flank w
ith orders to re
treat immediate
"ly.

Zherkóv,"
 not removing hi
s hand from his 
"cap, turned his "
horse about and
 galloped off. B
ut no sooner had
 he left Bagrati
ón than his cou
rage failed him
. He was seized 
by panic and cou
ld not go where 
it was dangerou
s.  Having rea
ched the left fl
"ank, instead of "
going to the fro
nt where the fi
"ring was, he beg"
an to look for t
he general and h
is staff where t
hey could not p
"ossibly be, and "
so did not deliv
er the order.  
 The command of 
the left flank b
elonged by senio
rity to the comm
ander of the re
giment Kutúzov 
had reviewed at 
Braunau and in w
hich Dólokhov w
as serving as a
 private. But th
e command of the
 extreme left fl
ank had been as
signed to the co
mmander of the P
ávlograd regime
nt in which Rost
óv was serving
", and a misunder"
standing arose. 
The two commande
rs were much ex
asperated with o
"ne another and, "
long after the a
ction had begun 
on the right fl
ank and the Fren
ch were already 
"advancing, were "
engaged in disc
ussion with the 
sole object of o
ffending one ano
ther. But the r
"egiments, both c"
avalry and infan
"try, were by no "
means ready for 
the impending a
ction. From priv
ates to general 
they were not ex
pecting a battl
e and were engag
ed in peaceful o
"ccupations, the "
cavalry feeding 
the horses and 
the infantry col
lecting wood.  
 “He higher is
"s dan I in rank,"
” said the Ger
man colonel of t
"he
hussars, flu"
shing and addres
sing an adjutant
 who had ridden 
"up, “so
let h"
im do what he vi
"ll, but I cannot"
 sacrifice my hu
"ssars... Bugler,"
 sount ze retre
at!”  But ha
ste was becoming
 imperative. Can
non and musketry
", mingling
toge"
"ther, thundered "
on the right and
" in the center, "
while the capote
s of Lannes’ 
sharpshooters we
re already seen 
crossing the mil
ldam and formin
g up within twic
e the range of a
 musket shot. Th
e general in co
mmand of the inf
antry went towar
d his horse with
" jerky steps, an"
d having mounte
d drew himself u
p very straight 
and tall and rod
e to the Pávlo
grad commander. 
The commanders m
et with polite b
ows but with se
cret malevolence
 in their hearts
.  “Once aga
"in, Colonel,” "
said the general
", “I can’t l"
eave half my me
n in the wood. I
" beg of you, I b"
"eg of you,” he"
" repeated, “to"
 occupy the pos
ition and prepar
e for an attack.
”  “I peg 
of you yourself 
not to mix in vo
t is not your bu
siness!” sudd
enly replied the
 irate colonel. 
“If you vere i
n the cavalry...
”  “I am n
ot in the cavalr
"y, Colonel, but "
I am a Russian g
eneral and if y
ou are not aware
 of the fact...�
��  “Quite a
"vare, your excel"
"lency,” sudden"
ly shouted the c
"olonel,
touchin"
g his horse and 
turning purple i
n the face. “V
ill you be so g
oot to come to z
e front and see 
dat zis position
 iss no goot? I 
don’t vish to
 destroy my men 
for your pleasur
e!”  “You 
"forget yourself,"
 Colonel. I am n
ot considering m
y own pleasure 
and I won’t al
low it to be sai
d!”  Taking 
the colonel’s 
outburst as a ch
allenge to his c
"ourage, the
gen"
eral expanded hi
s chest and rode
", frowning, besi"
de him to the f
"ront line, as if"
 their differenc
es would be sett
led there amongs
t the bullets. 
They reached the
" front, several "
bullets sped ove
"r them, and
the"
y halted in sile
nce. There was n
othing fresh to 
be seen from the
"
line, for from"
 where they had 
been before it h
ad been evident 
that it was imp
ossible for cava
lry to act among
 the bushes and 
"broken ground,
"
as well as that 
the French were 
outflanking our 
left. The genera
l and colonel l
ooked sternly an
d significantly 
at one another l
ike two fightin
g cocks preparin
"g for battle, ea"
ch vainly trying
 to detect signs
 of cowardice i
n the other. Bot
h passed the exa
mination success
fully. As there
 was nothing to 
"be said, and nei"
ther wished to g
ive occasion for
 it to be alleg
ed that he had b
een the first to
 leave the range
" of fire,
they "
would have remai
ned there for a 
long time testin
g each other’s
 courage had it
 not been that j
ust then they he
ard the rattle o
f musketry and 
a muffled shout 
almost behind th
em in the wood. 
The French had 
attacked the men
 collecting wood
 in the copse. I
t was no longer 
possible for th
e hussars to ret
reat with the in
fantry. They wer
e cut off from 
the line of retr
eat on the left 
by the French. H
owever inconveni
ent the positio
"n, it was now ne"
cessary to attac
k in order to cu
t a way through 
 for themselves.
  The squadron
 in which Rostó
v was serving ha
d scarcely time 
to mount before
 it was halted f
acing the enemy.
" Again, as at th"
"e Enns bridge,
"
there was nothin
g between the sq
uadron and the e
"nemy, and again "
that terrible d
ividing line of 
uncertainty and 
fear—resemblin
g the line sepa
rating the livin
g from the dead�
��lay between th
em. All were co
nscious of this 
"unseen line, and"
 the question wh
ether they would
 cross it or no
"t, and how they "
"would cross it, "
agitated them al
l.  The colone
l rode to the fr
"ont, angrily gav"
e some reply to 
questions put t
o him by the off
"icers, and, like"
 a man desperate
ly insisting on 
having his own 
"way, gave an ord"
er. No one said 
anything definit
"e, but the rumor"
 of an attack s
pread through th
e squadron. The 
command to form 
up rang out and
 the sabers whiz
zed as they were
 drawn from thei
r scabbards. St
ill no one moved
. The troops of 
"the left flank, "
infantry and hus
"sars
alike, fel"
t that the comma
nder did not him
self know what t
"o do, and this
"
irresolution com
municated itself
 to the men.  
“If only they 
would be quick!�
�� thought Rost�
"�v, feeling that"
 at last the ti
me had come to e
xperience the jo
y of an attack o
f which he had s
o often heard f
rom his fellow h
ussars.  “Fo
"’ward, with Go"
"d, lads!” rang"
 out Denísov’
s voice. “At a
 twot fo’ward
!”  The hors
es’ croups beg
an to sway in th
e front line. Ro
ok pulled at the
 reins and star
ted of his own a
ccord.  Before
" him, on the rig"
"ht, Rostóv saw "
the front lines 
of his hussars a
nd still farthe
r ahead a dark l
ine which he cou
ld not see disti
nctly but took 
to be the enemy.
 Shots could be 
"heard, but some "
way off.  “F
aster!” came t
he word of comma
"nd, and Rostóv "
felt Rook’s fl
anks drooping a
s he broke into 
a gallop.  Ros
tóv anticipated
 his horse’s m
ovements and bec
ame more and mor
e elated. He ha
d noticed a soli
tary tree ahead 
of him. This tre
e had been in t
he middle of the
 line that had s
eemed so terribl
e—and now he 
had crossed that
 line and not on
ly was there not
"hing terrible, b"
ut everything w
as becoming more
 and more happy 
and animated. �
"�Oh, how I
will"
 slash at him!�
� thought Rostó
"v, gripping the "
hilt of his sabe
r.  “Hur-a-a
-a-ah!” came a
 roar of voices.
 “Let anyone c
"ome my way
now,"
” thought Rost
óv driving his 
spurs into Rook 
and letting him 
go at a full ga
llop so that he 
outstripped the 
"others. Ahead, t"
he enemy was al
ready visible. S
uddenly somethin
g like a birch b
room seemed to s
weep over the s
quadron. Rostóv
 raised his sabe
"r, ready to stri"
"ke, but at
that"
 instant the tro
"oper Nikítenko,"
 who was gallopi
"ng ahead, shot a"
"way
from him, a"
nd Rostóv felt 
as in a dream th
at he continued 
to be carried f
orward with unna
tural speed but 
yet stayed on th
e same spot. Fro
m behind him Bo
"ndarchúk, an hu"
"ssar he knew, jo"
lted against him
 and looked ang
rily at him. Bon
darchúk’s hor
se swerved and g
alloped past.  
 “How is it I 
am not moving? I
" have fallen, I "
am killed!” Ro
stóv asked and
 answered at the
 same instant. H
e was alone in t
he middle of a 
field. Instead o
f the moving hor
ses and hussars�
"�� backs, he saw"
 nothing before
 him but the mot
ionless earth an
d the stubble ar
ound him. There 
 was warm blood 
under his arm. �
"��No, I am wound"
ed and the horse
 is killed.” 
Rook tried to ri
se on his forele
gs but fell back
", pinning his
r"
ider’s leg. Bl
ood was flowing 
from his head; h
e struggled but 
could not rise.
 Rostóv also tr
ied to rise but 
"fell back, his s"
abretache havin
g become entangl
ed in the saddle
. Where our men 
"were, and where "
"the
French, he "
did not know. Th
ere was no one n
ear.  Having d
isentangled his 
"leg, he rose. �"
"�Where, on which"
" side, was now
"
the line that ha
d so sharply div
ided the two arm
ies?” he asked
 himself and co
uld not answer. 
“Can something
 bad have happen
ed to me?” he
 wondered as he 
got up: and at t
hat moment he fe
lt that somethin
g superfluous w
as hanging on hi
s benumbed left 
arm. The wrist f
elt as if it we
re not his. He e
xamined his hand
" carefully, vain"
ly trying to fin
d blood on it. 
"“Ah, here are "
"people coming,�"
� he thought joy
"fully,
seeing s"
ome men running 
toward him. “T
hey will help me
!” In front c
ame a man wearin
g a strange shak
o and a blue clo
"ak, swarthy, sun"
"burned,
and wit"
h a hooked nose.
 Then came two m
"ore, and many mo"
re running behi
nd. One of them 
said something s
"trange, not in R"
ussian. In among
 the hindmost o
f these men wear
ing similar shak
os was a Russian
 hussar. He was
 being held by t
he arms and his 
horse was being 
led behind him. 
  “It must be
" one of ours, a "
prisoner. Yes. C
an it be that th
ey will take me
 too? Who are th
ese men?” thou
"ght Rostóv, sca"
rcely believing 
 his eyes. “Ca
n they be French
?” He looked a
t the approachin
"g
Frenchmen, an"
d though but a m
oment before he 
had been gallopi
ng to get at th
em and hack them
" to pieces, thei"
r proximity now 
seemed so awful 
 that he could n
ot believe his e
yes. “Who are 
they? Why are th
ey running? Can
 they be coming 
at me? And why? 
To kill me? Me w
hom everyone is
 so fond of?” 
He remembered hi
s mother’s lov
"e for him, and h"
"is
family’s, "
and his friends�
"��, and the enem"
y’s intention 
to kill him see
med impossible. 
“But perhaps t
hey may do it!�
� For more than 
ten seconds he 
stood not moving
 from the spot o
r realizing the 
situation. The 
foremost Frenchm
"an, the one with"
 the hooked nose
", was already so"
 close that the
 expression of h
is face could be
 seen. And the e
"xcited,
alien f"
"ace of that man,"
 his bayonet han
"ging down, holdi"
"ng his breath,
"
and running so l
"ightly, frighten"
ed Rostóv. He s
eized his pistol
" and,
instead o"
"f firing it, flu"
ng it at the Fre
nchman and ran w
ith all his mig
ht toward the bu
shes. He did not
 now run with th
e feeling of dou
bt and conflict
 with which he h
ad trodden the E
"nns bridge, but "
with the feelin
g of a hare flee
ing from the hou
nds. One single 
"sentiment, that"
 of fear for his
 young and happy
" life, possessed"
 his whole being
. Rapidly leapi
"ng the furrows, "
he fled across t
he field with th
e impetuosity he
 used to show a
"t catchplay, now"
 and then turnin
g his good-natur
"ed, pale,
young"
 face to look ba
ck. A shudder of
 terror went thr
"ough him: “No,"
 better not loo
"k,” he thought"
", but having rea"
ched the bushes 
he glanced roun
d once more. The
 French had fall
"en behind, and j"
ust as he looked
 round the firs
t man changed hi
s run to a walk 
"and, turning, sh"
outed something
 loudly to a com
rade farther bac
k. Rostóv pause
"d. “No,
there"
’s some mistak
"e,” thought he"
. “They can’
t have wanted to
 kill me.” Bu
t at the same ti
"me, his left arm"
 felt as heavy a
s if a seventy-
pound weight wer
e tied to it. He
 could run no mo
re. The Frenchm
an also stopped 
and took aim. Ro
stóv closed his
 eyes and stoope
d down. One bul
let and then ano
ther whistled pa
st him. He muste
red his last re
maining strength
", took hold of h"
is left hand wit
"h his right, and"
 reached the bu
shes. Behind the
se were some Rus
sian sharpshoote
rs.      C
HAPTER XX  The
 infantry regime
nts that had bee
n caught unaware
s in the outskir
ts of the wood 
"ran out of it, t"
he different com
panies getting m
"ixed, and
retre"
ated as a disord
erly crowd. One 
"soldier, in his "
"fear, uttered th"
e senseless cry
", “Cut off!”"
 that is so terr
"ible in battle, "
and that word i
nfected the whol
e crowd with a f
eeling of panic.
  “Surrounde
d! Cut off? We�
�re lost!” sho
uted the fugitiv
es.  The momen
t he heard the f
iring and the cr
"y from behind, t"
he general real
ized that someth
ing dreadful had
 happened to his
" regiment, and t"
he thought that
" he, an exemplar"
y officer of man
y years’ servi
ce who had neve
"r been to blame,"
 might be held r
esponsible at he
adquarters for 
negligence or in
efficiency so st
aggered him that
", forgetting the"
 recalcitrant c
"avalry colonel, "
his own dignity 
"as a general, an"
d above all qui
te forgetting th
e danger and all
 regard for self
"-preservation, h"
e clutched the 
crupper of his s
"addle and, spurr"
"ing his horse, g"
alloped to the 
regiment under a
 hail of bullets
 which fell arou
"nd, but fortunat"
ely missed him.
 His one desire 
was to know what
 was happening a
nd at any cost 
"correct, or reme"
"dy, the mistake "
if he had made o
"ne, so that he,"
 an exemplary of
ficer of twenty-
two years’ ser
"vice, who had ne"
ver been censur
"ed, should not b"
e held to blame.
  Having gallo
ped safely throu
"gh the French, h"
e reached a fiel
d behind the co
pse across which
" our men, regard"
"less of orders, "
were running and
 descending the
 valley. That mo
ment of moral he
sitation which d
ecides the fate
 of battles had 
arrived. Would t
his disorderly c
rowd of soldiers
 attend to the 
voice of their c
"ommander, or wou"
"ld they, disrega"
"rding him,
cont"
inue their fligh
t? Despite his d
esperate shouts 
that used to see
m so terrible t
"o the soldiers, "
despite his furi
ous purple count
enance distorte
d out of all lik
eness to his for
"mer self, and th"
e flourishing of
"
his saber, the"
 soldiers all co
"ntinued to run, "
"talking, firing "
"into the
air, a"
nd disobeying or
ders. The moral 
hesitation which
 decided the fat
e of battles wa
s evidently culm
inating in a pan
ic.  The gener
al had a fit of 
coughing as a re
sult of shouting
 and of the pow
der smoke and st
opped in despair
. Everything see
med lost. But at
 that moment th
e French who wer
"e attacking, sud"
denly and withou
t any apparent 
"reason, ran back"
 and disappeared
 from the outski
"rts, and Russian"
 sharpshooters 
showed themselve
s in the copse. 
It was Timókhin
"’s
company, w"
hich alone had m
aintained its or
der in the wood 
"and, having
lai"
n in ambush in a
" ditch, now atta"
cked the French 
unexpectedly. T
"imókhin, armed "
only with a swor
"d, had rushed at"
 the enemy with 
such a desperat
e cry and such m
"ad, drunken dete"
"rmination that, "
taken by surpri
"se, the French h"
ad thrown down t
heir muskets and
" run. Dólokhov,"
 running beside
" Timókhin, kill"
ed a Frenchman a
t close quarters
 and was the fi
rst to seize the
 surrendering Fr
ench officer by 
his collar. Our 
 fugitives retur
"ned, the battali"
"ons re-formed, a"
nd the French wh
o had nearly cu
t our left flank
 in half were fo
r the moment rep
ulsed. Our rese
rve units were a
"ble to join up, "
and the fight wa
s at an end. The
 regimental com
mander and Major
 Ekonómov had s
topped beside a 
"bridge,
letting"
 the retreating 
companies pass b
"y them, when a s"
oldier came up 
and took hold of
 the commander�
"�s stirrup, almo"
st leaning again
st him. The man
 was wearing a b
luish coat of br
"oadcloth, he had"
 no knapsack or
" cap, his head w"
"as bandaged, and"
 over his should
er a French muni
tion pouch was 
slung. He had an
 officer’s swo
rd in his hand. 
The soldier was
" pale, his blue "
eyes looked impu
dently into the 
commander’s fa
"ce,
and his lip"
s were smiling. 
Though the comma
nder was occupie
d in giving ins
tructions to Maj
"or Ekonómov, he"
 could not help 
taking notice of
 the soldier. 
 “Your excell
"ency, here are t"
"wo trophies,” "
"said Dólokhov, "
pointing to the
 French sword an
d pouch. “I ha
ve taken an offi
cer prisoner. I 
 stopped the com
pany.” Dólokh
ov breathed heav
ily from wearine
ss and spoke in
 abrupt sentence
s. “The whole 
company can bear
 witness. I beg 
 you will rememb
"er this, your ex"
cellency!”  
"“All right, al"
"l right,” repl"
ied the commande
"r, and turned to"
 Major Ekonómo
v.  But Dólok
hov did not go a
way; he untied t
he handkerchief 
around his head
", pulled it off,"
 and showed the 
blood congealed 
on his hair.  
“A bayonet wou
nd. I remained a
t the front. Rem
"ember, your
exc"
ellency!”   
 Túshin’s bat
tery had been fo
rgotten and only
 at the very end
 of the action 
did Prince Bagra
"tión, still hea"
ring the cannona
de in the center
",
send his orde"
rly staff office
"r, and later Pri"
"nce Andrew also,"
 to order the b
attery to retire
 as quickly as p
ossible. When th
e supports attac
hed to Túshin�
��s battery had 
been moved away 
in the middle of
 the action by 
someone’s orde
"r, the battery h"
ad continued fir
ing and was only
 not captured b
y the French bec
ause the enemy c
ould not surmise
 that anyone co
uld have the eff
rontery to conti
nue firing from 
four quite undef
ended guns. On 
"the contrary, th"
e energetic acti
on of that batte
ry led the Fren
ch to suppose th
at here—in the
 center—the ma
in Russian force
s were concentr
ated. Twice they
 had attempted t
o attack this po
"int, but on
eac"
h occasion had b
een driven back 
by grapeshot fro
m the four isola
ted guns on the
 hillock.  Soo
n after Prince B
agratión had le
"ft him, Túshin "
had succeeded in
 setting fire t
o Schön Grabern
.  “Look at 
them scurrying! 
It’s burning! 
Just see the smo
ke! Fine! Grand
! Look at the sm
"oke, the smoke!�"
�� exclaimed the
" artillerymen,
"
brightening up. 
"

All the guns,"
 without waiting
" for orders, wer"
e being fired in
 the direction 
of the conflagra
tion. As if urgi
ng each other on
", the soldiers
"
cried at each sh
ot: “Fine! Tha
t’s good! Look
 at it... Grand!
"” The
fire, f"
anned by the bre
"eze, was rapidly"
 spreading. The 
French columns 
that had advance
d beyond the vil
lage went back; 
but as though in
 revenge for th
"is failure, the "
enemy placed ten
 guns to the rig
ht of the villag
e and began fir
ing them at Tús
hin’s battery.
  In their chi
"ldlike glee, aro"
used by the fire
 and their luck 
in successfully
 cannonading the
" French, our art"
illerymen only n
oticed this bat
tery when two ba
"lls, and then fo"
"ur more, fell am"
"ong our guns, on"
e knocking over
 two horses and 
another tearing 
off a munition-w
agon driver’s
 leg. Their spir
its once roused 
"were, however, n"
"ot diminished,
"
but only changed
 character. The 
horses were repl
aced by others f
rom a reserve g
"un carriage, the"
 wounded were ca
"rried away, and "
the four guns w
ere turned again
st the ten-gun b
attery. Túshin�
��s companion of
ficer had been 
killed at the be
ginning of the e
ngagement and wi
thin an hour se
venteen of the f
orty men of the 
guns’ crews ha
"d been disabled,"
 but the artill
erymen were stil
l as merry and l
ively as ever. T
wice they notic
ed the French ap
pearing below th
"em, and then the"
y fired grapesho
t at them.  L
"ittle Túshin, m"
oving feebly and
" awkwardly, kept"
 telling his ord
erly to “refi
ll my pipe for t
hat one!” and 
"then, scattering"
" sparks from it,"
 ran forward sh
ading his eyes w
ith his small ha
nd to look at th
e French.  “
"Smack at ‘em, "
lads!” he kept
" saying, seizing"
 the guns by the
 wheels and wor
king the screws 
himself.  Amid
" the smoke, deaf"
ened by the ince
ssant reports wh
ich always made 
"him
jump, Túsh"
in not taking hi
s pipe from his 
mouth ran from g
"un to gun,
now "
"aiming, now coun"
ting the charges
", now giving ord"
ers about replac
ing dead or wou
nded horses and 
harnessing fresh
" ones, and shout"
ing in his feeb
"le voice, so hig"
h pitched and ir
resolute. His fa
ce grew more and
 more animated.
 Only when a man
 was killed or w
ounded did he fr
own and turn aw
ay from the sigh
"t, shouting angr"
ily at the men w
"ho, as is always"
"
the case, hesi"
tated about lift
ing the injured 
or dead. The sol
"diers,
for the "
most part handso
"me fellows and, "
as is always the
 case in an art
"illery company, "
a head and shoul
ders taller and 
twice as broad 
as their officer
—all looked at
 their commander
 like children i
n an embarrassi
"ng situation, an"
d the expression
 on his face was
 invariably ref
lected on theirs
.  Owing to th
e terrible uproa
r and the necess
ity for concentr
ation and activ
"ity, Túshin did"
 not experience 
the slightest un
pleasant sense o
"f
fear, and the"
 thought that he
 might be killed
 or badly wounde
d never occurre
d to him. On the
" contrary, he be"
came more and mo
re elated. It s
eemed to him tha
t it was a very 
"long time ago, a"
"lmost a day, sin"
ce he had first
 seen the enemy 
and fired the fi
"rst shot, and th"
at the corner o
f the field he s
tood on was well
-known and famil
iar ground. Thou
gh he thought o
"f everything, co"
nsidered everyth
"ing, and did eve"
rything the bes
t of officers co
uld do in his po
"sition, he was i"
n a state akin t
o feverish deli
rium or drunkenn
ess.  From the
 deafening sound
s of his own gun
"s around him, th"
e whistle and t
hud of the enemy
’s cannon ball
"s, from the flus"
hed and perspiri
ng faces of the
 crew bustling r
"ound the guns, f"
rom the sight of
 the blood of m
"en and horses, f"
rom the little p
uffs of smoke on
 the enemy’s s
ide (always fol
lowed by a ball 
flying past and 
striking the ear
"th, a man, a
gu"
"n, a horse), fro"
m the sight of a
ll these things 
a fantastic worl
d of his own ha
d taken possessi
on of his brain 
and at that mome
nt afforded him
 pleasure. The e
nemy’s guns we
re in his fancy 
not guns but pip
es from which o
ccasional puffs 
were blown by an
 invisible smoke
r.  “There..
. he’s puffing
" again,” mutte"
red Túshin to h
"imself, as a
sm"
all cloud rose f
rom the hill and
 was borne in a 
streak to the le
ft by the wind.
  “Now look 
out for the ball
... we’ll thro
w it back.”  
 “What do you 
"want, your honor"
?” asked an ar
"tilleryman, stan"
"ding
close by, "
who heard him mu
ttering.  “N
othing... only a
 shell...” he 
answered.  “
"Come along, our "
Matvévna!” he
 said to himself
. “Matvévna�
� * was the nam
e his fancy gave
 to the farthest
 gun of the batt
"ery, which
was "
large and of an 
old pattern. The
 French swarming
 round their gun
s seemed to him
 like ants. In t
"hat world, the h"
andsome drunkard
 Number One of 
the second gun�
�s crew was “u
ncle”; Túshin
 looked at him m
ore often than 
at anyone else a
nd took delight 
in his every mov
ement. The soun
d of musketry at
 the foot of the
" hill, now dimin"
"ishing, now
inc"
"reasing, seemed "
like someone’s
 breathing. He l
istened intently
 to the ebb and
 flow of these s
ounds.      * 
Daughter of Matt
hew.  “Ah! B
"reathing again, "
breathing!” he
 muttered to him
self.  He imag
ined himself as 
an enormously ta
"ll, powerful man"
 who was throwin
g cannon balls 
at the French wi
th both hands. 
"
“Now then, M"
"atvévna, dear o"
"ld lady, don’t"
 let me down!”
 he was saying 
as he moved from
" the gun, when a"
" strange, unfami"
liar voice calle
d above his hea
d: “Captain T�
�shin! Captain!�
��  Túshin tu
rned round in di
smay. It was the
 staff officer w
ho had turned h
im out of the bo
oth at Grunth. H
e was shouting i
n a gasping voic
e:  “Are you
 mad? You have t
wice been ordere
"d to retreat, an"
d you...”  �
��Why are they d
own on me?” th
"ought Túshin, l"
ooking in alarm 
at his superior
.  “I... don
’t...” he mu
"ttered, holding "
up two fingers t
o his cap. “I
...”  But th
e staff officer 
did not finish w
hat he wanted to
 say. A cannon 
"ball, flying clo"
"se to him, cause"
d him to duck an
d bend over his 
horse. He pause
"d, and just as h"
e was about to s
ay something mor
"e, another ball"
 stopped him. He
 turned his hors
e and galloped o
ff.  “Retire
! All to retire!
” he shouted f
rom a distance. 
  The soldiers 
laughed. A momen
"t later, an adju"
tant arrived wit
h the same orde
r.  It was Pri
nce Andrew. The 
first thing he s
aw on riding up 
to the space wh
ere Túshin’s 
guns were statio
ned was an unhar
nessed horse wit
"h a
broken leg,"
 that lay scream
ing piteously be
side the harness
ed horses. Bloo
d was gushing fr
om its leg as fr
om a spring. Amo
ng the limbers l
ay several dead
 men. One ball a
fter another pas
sed over as he a
pproached and h
e felt a nervous
 shudder run dow
n his spine. But
 the mere though
t of being afra
id roused him ag
ain. “I cannot
" be afraid,” t"
"hought he,
and "
dismounted slowl
y among the guns
. He delivered t
he order and did
 not leave the 
battery. He deci
ded to have the 
guns removed fro
m their positio
ns and withdrawn
 in his presence
. Together with 
"Túshin, steppin"
g across the bo
dies and under a
 terrible fire f
"rom the French, "
he attended to 
the removal of t
he guns.  “A
 staff officer w
as here a minute
" ago, but skippe"
"d off,” said a"
n artilleryman 
to Prince Andrew
. “Not like yo
ur honor!”  
Prince Andrew sa
id nothing to T�
�shin. They were
 both so busy as
 to seem not to
 notice one anot
her. When having
 limbered up the
 only two cannon
 that remained 
uninjured out of
" the four, they "
began moving dow
n the hill (one
 shattered gun a
nd one unicorn w
ere left behind)
", Prince Andrew "
rode up to Tús
"hin.

“Well,"
 till we meet ag
ain...” he sai
"d, holding out h"
is hand to Tús
hin.  “Good-
"by, my dear fell"
"ow,” said Tús"
hin. “Dear sou
"l! Good-by, my
"
dear fellow!” 
and for some unk
nown reason tear
s suddenly fille
d his eyes.  
    CHAPTER 
XXI  The wind 
had fallen and b
"lack clouds, mer"
ging with the po
"wder smoke,
hun"
g low over the f
ield of battle o
n the horizon. I
t was growing d
ark and the glow
 of two conflagr
ations was the m
ore conspicuous.
 The cannonade 
"was dying down, "
but the rattle o
f musketry behin
d and on the ri
ght sounded ofte
ner and nearer. 
As soon as Túsh
in with his guns
",
continually d"
riving round or 
coming upon woun
"ded men, was out"
 of range of fi
re and had desce
nded into the di
"p, he was met by"
 some of the sta
"ff,
among them "
the staff office
"r and Zherkóv, "
who had been twi
ce sent to Tús
hin’s battery 
but had never re
ached it. Interr
upting one anot
"her, they all ga"
"ve, and transmit"
"ted, orders as t"
o how to proceed
",
reprimanding "
and reproaching 
him. Túshin gav
"e no orders, and"
",
silently—fe"
aring to speak b
ecause at every 
word he felt rea
dy to weep with
out knowing why�
��rode behind on
 his artillery n
ag. Though the 
orders were to a
bandon the wound
"ed, many of them"
 dragged themsel
ves after troop
s and begged for
 seats on the gu
n carriages. The
 jaunty infantr
y officer who ju
st before the ba
ttle had rushed 
out of Túshin�
��s wattle shed 
"was laid, with a"
 bullet in his s
"tomach, on
“M"
atvévna’s” 
carriage. At the
 foot of the hil
"l, a pale hussar"
"
cadet, support"
ing one hand wit
"h the other, cam"
e up to Túshin 
and asked for a
 seat.  “Cap
"tain, for God’"
s sake! I’ve h
"urt my arm,” h"
e said timidly. 
 “For God’s 
sake... I can’
t walk. For God�
��s sake!”  
It was plain tha
t this cadet had
 already repeate
dly asked for a 
lift and been r
efused. He asked
 in a hesitating
", piteous voice."
  “Tell them
 to give me a se
"at, for God’s "
sake!”  “G
"ive him a seat,�"
�� said Túshin.
 “Lay a cloak 
for him to sit o
"n,
lad,” he s"
"aid, addressing "
his favorite sol
dier. “And whe
re is the wound
ed officer?” 
 “He has been
 set down. He di
"ed,” replied s"
omeone.  “He
lp him up. Sit d
"own, dear fellow"
", sit down! Spre"
ad out the cloak
",
Antónov.”"
  The cadet was
 Rostóv. With o
ne hand he suppo
rted the other; 
he was pale and
 his jaw tremble
"d, shivering fev"
erishly. He was 
placed on “Ma
"tvévna,” the "
gun from which t
hey had removed 
the dead officer
. The cloak the
y spread under h
im was wet with 
blood which stai
ned his breeche
s and arm.  �
"�What, are you w"
"ounded, my lad?�"
"�� said Túshin,"
 approaching the
 gun on which R
ostóv sat.  �
"��No, it’s a s"
prain.”  “
Then what is thi
s blood on the g
un carriage?” 
inquired Túshin
.  “It was t
"he officer, your"
" honor, stained "
"it,” answered "
the artilleryma
"n, wiping away t"
he blood with hi
"s coat sleeve, a"
s if apologizin
g for the state 
of his gun.  I
t was all that t
hey could do to 
get the guns up 
the rise aided b
"y the
infantry,"
 and having reac
hed the village 
of Gruntersdorf 
they halted. It 
 had grown so da
rk that one coul
d not distinguis
h the uniforms t
"en paces
off, a"
nd the firing ha
d begun to subsi
"de. Suddenly, ne"
ar by on the ri
"ght, shouting an"
d firing were ag
ain heard. Flash
es of shot gleam
ed in the darkn
ess. This was th
e last French at
tack and was met
 by soldiers wh
o had sheltered 
in the village h
ouses. They all 
rushed out of t
he village again
", but Túshin’"
s guns could not
" move, and the
"
"artillerymen, T�"
"�shin, and the c"
adet exchanged s
ilent glances as
 they awaited t
heir fate. The f
iring died down 
"and soldiers, ta"
"lking eagerly,
"
streamed out of 
a side street. 
"
“Not hurt, P"
etróv?” asked
 one.  “We�
�ve given it ‘
"em hot, mate! Th"
ey won’t make 
another push no
"w,” said anoth"
er.  “You co
uldn’t see a t
hing. How they s
hot at their own
 fellows! Nothi
ng could be seen
". Pitch-dark, br"
other! Isn’t t
here something t
o drink?”  
The French had b
een repulsed for
 the last time. 
And again and ag
ain in the comp
lete darkness T�
�shin’s guns m
"oved forward, su"
rrounded by the 
 humming infantr
y as by a frame.
  In the darkn
"ess, it seemed a"
s though a gloom
y unseen river w
as flowing alwa
ys in one direct
"ion, humming wit"
h whispers and t
alk and the soun
d of hoofs and 
wheels. Amid the
" general rumble,"
 the groans and 
voices of the w
ounded were more
 distinctly hear
d than any other
 sound in the da
rkness of the n
ight. The gloom 
that enveloped t
he army was fill
ed with their g
"roans, which see"
med to melt into
 one with the da
rkness of the ni
ght. After a wh
ile the moving m
ass became agita
"ted, someone rod"
e past on a whi
te horse followe
"d by his suite, "
and said somethi
ng in passing: 
“What did he s
"ay? Where to, no"
"w? Halt, is it? "
Did he thank us?
” came eager 
questions from a
ll sides. The wh
ole moving mass 
began pressing 
closer together 
and a report spr
ead that they we
re ordered to ha
lt: evidently t
hose in front ha
d halted. All re
mained where the
y were in the m
iddle of the mud
dy road.  Fire
s were lighted a
nd the talk beca
me more audible.
 Captain Túshin
",
having given "
orders to his co
"mpany, sent a so"
ldier to find a 
dressing statio
n or a doctor fo
"r the cadet, and"
 sat down by a b
onfire the sold
iers had kindled
 on the road. Ro
"stóv, too, drag"
ged himself to t
he fire. From p
"ain, cold, and d"
"amp, a feverish "
shivering shook 
his whole body.
 Drowsiness was 
irresistibly mas
"tering him, but "
he kept awake by
 an excruciatin
g pain in his ar
"m, for which he "
could find no sa
tisfactory posi
tion. He kept cl
osing his eyes a
nd then again lo
oking at the fir
"e,
which seemed"
 to him dazzling
"ly red, and at t"
"he feeble, round"
-shouldered fig
ure of Túshin w
ho was sitting c
ross-legged like
 a Turk beside h
im. Túshin’s
" large, kind, in"
telligent eyes w
ere fixed with s
ympathy and com
miseration on Ro
"stóv, who saw t"
hat Túshin with
 his whole heart
 wished to help
 him but could n
ot.  From all 
sides were heard
 the footsteps a
nd talk of the i
"nfantry, who
we"
"re walking, driv"
"ing past, and se"
ttling down all 
around. The soun
"d
of voices, th"
"e tramping feet,"
 the horses’ h
oofs moving in m
"ud, the
crackli"
ng of wood fires
" near and afar, "
merged into one 
tremulous rumble
.  It was no l
"onger, as before"
", a dark, unseen"
 river flowing t
hrough the gloo
"m, but a dark se"
a swelling and g
radually subsidi
ng after a storm
. Rostóv looke
d at and listene
d listlessly to 
what passed befo
re and around h
im. An infantrym
an came to the f
"ire, squatted on"
" his heels, held"
 his hands to t
"he blaze, and tu"
rned away his fa
ce.  “You do
n’t mind your 
honor?” he ask
ed Túshin. “I
’ve lost my c
"ompany, your hon"
or. I don’t kn
ow where... such
 bad luck!”  
 With the soldie
"r, an infantry o"
fficer with a ba
ndaged cheek cam
e up to the bon
"fire, and addres"
sing Túshin ask
ed him to have t
he guns moved a 
 trifle to let a
 wagon go past. 
After he had gon
"e, two soldiers "
rushed to the c
ampfire. They we
re quarreling an
d fighting despe
"rately, each try"
ing to snatch f
rom the other a 
boot they were b
oth holding on t
o.  “You pic
ked it up?... I 
dare say! You’
re very smart!�
� one of them s
houted hoarsely.
"

Then a thin,"
" pale soldier, h"
is neck bandaged
 with a bloodsta
"ined leg
band, "
came up and in a
ngry tones asked
 the artilleryme
n for water.  
“Must one die 
like a dog?” s
aid he.  Túsh
in told them to 
give the man som
e water. Then a 
cheerful soldier
"
ran up, beggin"
g a little fire 
for the infantry
.  “A nice l
ittle hot torch 
for the infantry
! Good luck to y
"ou, fellow
coun"
trymen. Thanks f
or the fire—we
’ll return it 
"with interest,�"
"�
said he, carr"
ying away into t
he darkness a gl
owing stick.  
Next came four s
"oldiers, carryin"
g something heav
"y on a cloak, an"
d passed by the
 fire. One of th
em stumbled.  
“Who the devil
 has put the log
s on the road?�
� snarled he.  
 “He’s dead�
��why carry him?
” said another
.  “Shut up!
”  And they 
disappeared into
 the darkness wi
th their load. 
 “Still achin
g?” Túshin as
ked Rostóv in a
 whisper.  “
Yes.”  “Yo
"ur honor, you’"
re wanted by the
 general. He is 
"in the hut here,"
” said a gunn
"er, coming up to"
 Túshin.  “
"Coming, friend.�"
��  Túshin ro
"se and, buttonin"
g his greatcoat 
and pulling it s
"traight,
walked"
 away from the f
ire.  Not far 
from the artille
"ry campfire, in "
a hut that had b
een prepared fo
"r him, Prince Ba"
gratión sat at 
"dinner, talking "
with some comman
ding officers w
ho had gathered 
at his quarters.
 The little old 
man with the ha
lf-closed eyes w
as there greedil
y gnawing a mutt
"on bone, and the"
 general who ha
d served blamele
ssly for twenty-
"two years, flush"
ed by a glass o
f vodka and the 
dinner; and the 
staff officer wi
th the signet r
"ing, and Zherkó"
"v, uneasily glan"
cing at them all
", and Prince And"
"rew,
pale, with"
 compressed lips
 and feverishly 
glittering eyes.
  In a corner 
of the hut stood
 a standard capt
ured from the Fr
"ench, and
the a"
ccountant with t
he naïve face w
as feeling its t
"exture, shaking "
his head in per
plexity—perhap
s because the ba
nner really inte
"rested him,
per"
haps because it 
was hard for him
", hungry as he w"
"as, to look on a"
t a dinner wher
e there was no p
lace for him. In
 the next hut th
ere was a Frenc
h colonel who ha
d been taken pri
soner by our dra
goons. Our offic
ers were flocki
ng in to look at
 him. Prince Bag
ratión was than
king the indivi
dual commanders 
and inquiring in
to details of th
e action and our
 losses. The ge
neral whose regi
ment had been in
spected at Braun
au was informin
g the prince tha
t as soon as the
 action began he
 had withdrawn 
"from the wood, m"
ustered the men 
who were woodcut
"ting, and, allow"
ing the French 
"to pass him, had"
 made a bayonet 
charge with two 
battalions and 
had broken up th
e French troops.
  “When I sa
"w, your excellen"
"cy, that their f"
irst battalion w
as disorganized
", I stopped in t"
he road and thou
ght: ‘I’ll l
et them come on
 and will meet t
hem with the fir
e of the whole b
attalion’—an
d that’s what
 I did.”  Th
e general had so
 wished to do th
is and was so so
rry he had not m
anaged to do it
 that it seemed 
to him as if it 
had really happe
ned. Perhaps it
 might really ha
ve been so? Coul
d one possibly m
ake out amid all
 that confusion
 what did or did
 not happen?  
"“By the way, y"
"our excellency, "
I should inform 
"you,” he
cont"
inued—remember
ing Dólokhov’
s conversation w
ith Kutúzov and
 his last inter
view with the ge
ntleman-ranker�
�“that Private
" Dólokhov,
who"
 was reduced to 
"the ranks, took "
a French officer
 prisoner in my 
 presence and pa
rticularly disti
nguished himself
.”  “I saw
 the Pávlograd 
hussars attack t
"here, your excel"
"lency,” chimed"
"
in Zherkóv, l"
ooking uneasily 
around. He had n
ot seen the huss
ars all that da
"y, but had heard"
 about them from
 an infantry off
icer. “They b
roke up two squa
"res, your excell"
ency.”  Seve
ral of those pre
sent smiled at Z
herkóv’s word
"s, expecting one"
 of his usual j
"okes, but notici"
ng that what he 
was saying redou
nded to the glo
ry of our arms a
nd of the day’
"s work, they ass"
umed a serious 
"expression, thou"
gh many of them 
knew that what h
e was saying was
 a lie devoid o
f any foundation
. Prince Bagrati
ón turned to th
e old colonel: 
"
“Gentlemen, "
I thank you all;
 all arms have b
ehaved heroicall
"y:
infantry, ca"
"valry, and artil"
lery. How was it
 that two guns w
ere abandoned i
n the center?”
" he inquired, se"
arching with his
 eyes for someo
ne. (Prince Bagr
atión did not a
sk about the gun
s on the left f
lank; he knew th
at all the guns 
there had been a
bandoned at the 
very beginning 
of the action.) 
“I think I sen
t you?” he add
"ed, turning to
"
the staff office
r on duty.  �
�One was damaged
",” answered th"
"e staff officer,"
 “and the othe
r I can’t und
erstand. I was t
here all the tim
e giving orders 
and had only ju
st left.... It i
s true that it w
"as hot there,”"
" he added, modes"
tly.  Someone 
mentioned that C
aptain Túshin w
as bivouacking c
lose to the vil
lage and had alr
eady been sent f
"or.

“Oh, bu"
t you were there
?” said Prince
" Bagratión, add"
ressing Prince 
Andrew.  “Of
" course, we only"
 just missed one
" another,” sai"
d the staff off
"icer, with a smi"
le to Bolkónski
.  “I had no
t the pleasure o
"f seeing you,”"
 said Prince And
"rew, coldly
and"
 abruptly.  Al
l were silent. T
úshin appeared 
at the threshold
 and made his wa
y timidly from 
behind the backs
 of the generals
. As he stepped 
past the genera
ls in the crowde
"d hut, feeling e"
mbarrassed as he
 always was by t
he sight of his
" superiors, he d"
id not notice th
e staff of the b
anner and stumb
led over it. Sev
eral of those pr
esent laughed. 
 “How was it 
a gun was abando
ned?” asked Ba
"gratión, frowni"
"ng, not so
much"
 at the captain 
as at those who 
"were laughing, a"
mong whom Zherk�
�v laughed loud
est.  Only now
", when he was co"
nfronted by the 
stern authoritie
"s, did his guilt"
 and the disgra
ce of having los
t two guns and y
et remaining ali
ve present them
selves to Túshi
n in all their h
orror. He had be
en so excited th
at he had not t
hought about it 
until that momen
t. The officers�
�� laughter con
fused him still 
more. He stood b
efore Bagratión
 with his lower 
 jaw trembling a
nd was hardly ab
le to mutter: �
�I don’t know.
.. your excelle
ncy... I had no 
men... your exce
llency.”  �
�You might have 
taken some from 
the covering tro
ops.”  Túsh
in did not say t
hat there were n
o covering troop
"s, though that
"
was perfectly tr
ue. He was afrai
d of getting som
e other officer 
"into
trouble, a"
nd silently fixe
d his eyes on Ba
gratión as a sc
hoolboy who has
 blundered looks
 at an examiner.
  The silence 
lasted some time
. Prince Bagrati
"ón, apparently "
not wishing to 
"be severe, found"
 nothing to say;
 the others did 
not venture to 
intervene. Princ
e Andrew looked 
at Túshin from 
under his brows 
and his fingers
 twitched nervou
sly.  “Your 
excellency!” P
rince Andrew bro
ke the silence w
ith his abrupt 
"voice, “you we"
re pleased to se
nd me to Captain
 Túshin’s bat
tery. I went th
ere and found tw
o thirds of the 
men and horses k
"nocked out, two"
"
guns smashed, a"
nd no supports a
t all.”  Pri
nce Bagratión a
nd Túshin looke
d with equal int
entness at Bolk
"ónski, who spok"
e with suppresse
d agitation.  
"“And, if your "
excellency will 
allow me to expr
"ess my opinion,�"
�� he continued
", “we owe toda"
y’s success ch
iefly to the act
ion of that bat
tery and the her
oic endurance of
 Captain Túshin
 and his company
",”
and withou"
t awaiting a rep
"ly, Prince Andre"
w rose and left 
the table.  Pr
ince Bagratión 
looked at Túshi
"n, evidently rel"
uctant to show 
distrust in Bolk
ónski’s empha
tic opinion yet 
not feeling able
 fully to credi
"t it, bent his h"
"ead, and told T�"
�shin that he co
uld go. Prince 
Andrew went out 
with him.  “
Thank you; you s
"aved me, my dear"
 fellow!” said
 Túshin.  Pri
nce Andrew gave 
"him a look, but "
said nothing and
 went away. He f
elt sad and dep
ressed. It was a
"ll so strange, s"
o unlike what he
 had hoped.   
 “Who are they
? Why are they h
ere? What do the
y want? And when
 will all this 
end?” thought 
"Rostóv, looking"
 at the changing
 shadows before 
 him. The pain i
n his arm became
 more and more i
ntense. Irresist
ible drowsiness
 overpowered him
", red rings danc"
ed before his ey
"es, and the
imp"
ression of those
 voices and face
s and a sense of
 loneliness merg
ed with the phy
sical pain. It w
"as they, these s"
oldiers—wounde
d and unwounded
—it was they w
ho were crushing
", weighing down,"
 and twisting t
he sinews and sc
orching the fles
h of his spraine
d arm and should
er. To rid hims
elf of them he c
losed his eyes. 
  For a moment 
"he dozed, but in"
 that short inte
rval innumerable
 things appeare
d to him in a dr
eam: his mother 
and her large wh
"ite hand,
Sóny"
a’s thin littl
"e shoulders, Nat"
ásha’s eyes a
"nd laughter,
De"
nísov with his 
voice and mustac
"he, and Telyáni"
n and all that a
ffair with Tely
ánin and Bogdá
nich. That affai
r was the same t
hing as this so
ldier with the h
"arsh voice, and "
it was that affa
ir and this sold
ier that were s
"o agonizingly, i"
ncessantly pulli
ng and pressing 
his arm and alw
ays dragging it 
in one direction
. He tried to ge
t away from them
", but
they woul"
d not for an ins
tant let his sho
ulder move a hai
r’s breadth. 
It would not ach
e—it would be 
well—if only t
hey did not pull
" it, but
it was"
 impossible to g
et rid of them. 
  He opened his
 eyes and looked
 up. The black c
anopy of night h
ung less than a
 yard above the 
glow of the char
coal. Flakes of 
falling snow wer
e fluttering in
 that light. Tú
shin had not ret
"urned, the docto"
r had not come.
 He was alone no
"w, except for a "
soldier who was 
sitting naked at
 the other side
" of the fire, wa"
rming his thin y
ellow body.  �
��Nobody wants m
e!” thought Ro
stóv. “There 
is no one to hel
p me or pity me
. Yet I was once
" at home, strong"
", happy, and lov"
ed.” He sighed
"
and, doing so,"
 groaned involun
tarily.  “Eh
", is anything hu"
rting you?” as
"ked the soldier,"
 shaking his shi
rt out over the
" fire, and not w"
aiting for an an
swer he gave a g
runt and added:
 “What a lot o
f men have been 
crippled today�
�frightful!” 
 Rostóv did no
t listen to the 
soldier. He look
ed at the snowfl
akes fluttering
 above the fire 
and remembered a
 Russian winter 
"at his warm,
br"
"ight home, his f"
"luffy fur coat, "
his quickly glid
"ing sleigh, his"
"
healthy body, a"
nd all the affec
tion and care of
 his family. “
And why did I c
ome here?” he 
wondered.  Nex
t day the French
 army did not re
new their attack

was reunited to 
Kutúzov’s arm

OK THREE: 1805 
     CHAPTE
R I  Prince Va
síli was not a 
man who delibera
tely thought out
 his plans. Sti
ll less did he t
hink of injuring
 anyone for his 
own advantage. H
e was merely a 
man of the world
 who had got on 
and to whom gett
ing on had beco
me a habit. Sche
mes and devices 
for which he nev
er rightly accou
nted to himself
", but which form"
ed the whole int
erest of his lif
"e,
were constan"
tly shaping them
selves in his mi
"nd, arising from"
 the circumstan
ces and persons 
he met. Of these
 plans he had no
t merely one or
 two in his head
" but dozens, som"
e only beginning
 to form themsel
"ves,
some appro"
aching achieveme
"nt, and some in "
course of disint
egration. He di
"d not, for insta"
"nce, say to hims"
elf: “This man
 now has influen
"ce, I
must gain"
 his confidence 
and friendship a
nd through him o
btain a special 
 grant.” Nor d
id he say to him
self: “Pierre 
"is a rich man, I"
 must entice hi
m to marry my da
ughter and lend 
me the forty tho
usand rubles I 
need.” But whe
n he came across
 a man of positi
on his instinct 
 immediately tol
d him that this 
man could be use
"ful, and without"
 any premeditat
ion Prince Vasí
li took the firs
t opportunity to
 gain his confi
"dence, flatter h"
"im, become intim"
"ate with him, an"
d finally make h
is request.  
He had Pierre at
 hand in Moscow 
and procured for
 him an appointm
ent as Gentlema
n of the Bedcham
"ber, which at th"
at time conferre
d the status of 
 Councilor of St
"ate, and insiste"
d on the young m
an accompanying 
him to Petersbu
rg and staying a
t his house. Wit
h apparent absen
"t-mindedness,
y"
et with unhesita
ting assurance t
hat he was doing
 the right thing
",
Prince Vasíl"
i did everything
 to get Pierre t
o marry his daug
hter. Had he th
ought out his pl
ans beforehand h
e could not have
 been so natural
 and shown such
 unaffected fami
liarity in inter
course with ever
ybody both abov
e and below him 
in social standi
ng. Something al
ways drew him to
ward those rich
er and more powe
rful than himsel
f and he had rar
e skill in seiz
ing the most opp
ortune moment fo
r making use of 
people.  Pierr
"e, on unexpected"
ly becoming Coun
t Bezúkhov and 
"a rich man, felt"
 himself after 
his recent lonel
iness and freedo
m from cares so 
beset and preoc
cupied that only
 in bed was he a
ble to be by him
self. He had to 
"
sign papers, to"
 present himself
 at government o
"ffices, the purp"
ose of which wa
s not clear to h
"im, to question "
his chief stewar
"d, to visit his"
 estate near Mos
"cow, and to rece"
ive many people 
who formerly did
 not even wish 
to know of his e
xistence but wou
ld now have been
 offended and g
rieved had he ch
osen not to see 
them. These diff
erent people—
"businessmen, rel"
"ations, and acqu"
aintances alike�
��were all disp
osed to treat th
e young heir in 
the most friendl
y and flattering
 manner: they w
ere all evidentl
y firmly convinc
ed of Pierre’s
 noble qualitie
s. He was always
 hearing such wo
rds as: “With 
your remarkable 
"
kindness,” or"
", “With your e"
"xcellent heart,�"
�� “You are yo
urself so honor
"able, Count,” "
"or, “Were he a"
"s clever as you,"
"” and so on,
"
till he began si
ncerely to belie
ve in his own ex
ceptional kindne
ss and extraord
inary intelligen
"ce, the more so "
as in the depth 
of his heart it 
 had always seem
ed to him that h
e really was ver
y kind and intel
ligent. Even pe
ople who had for
merly been spite
ful toward him a
nd evidently un
friendly now bec
ame gentle and a
ffectionate. The
 angry eldest p
"rincess, with th"
e long waist and
 hair plastered 
down like a doll
"’s,
had come "
into Pierre’s 
room after the f
uneral. With dro
oping eyes and 
frequent blushes
 she told him sh
e was very sorry
 about their pas
t misunderstand
ings and did not
 now feel she ha
d a right to ask
 him for anythi
"ng, except only "
"for permission, "
after the blow s
"he had received,"
 to remain for 
a few weeks long
er in the house 
she so loved and
 where she had 
sacrificed so mu
ch. She could no
t refrain from w
eeping at these 
 words. Touched 
that this statue
sque princess co
"uld so change, P"
ierre took her 
hand and begged 
"her forgiveness,"
 without knowing
 what for. From
 that day the el
dest princess qu
ite changed towa
rd Pierre and be
gan knitting a 
striped scarf fo
r him.  “Do 
this for my sake
", mon cher; afte"
"r all, she had t"
o put up with a 
 great deal from
" the deceased,�"
� said Prince Va
"síli to him, ha"
nding him a dee
d to sign for th
e princess’ be
nefit.  Prince
 Vasíli had com
e to the conclus
ion that it was 
necessary to thr
ow this bone—
a bill for thirt
y thousand ruble
s—to the poor 
princess that i
t might not occu
r to her to spea
k of his share i
n the affair of 
 the inlaid port
folio. Pierre si
gned the deed an
d after that the
 princess grew 
still kinder. Th
e younger sister
s also became af
fectionate to hi
"m,
especially t"
"he youngest, the"
 pretty one with
" the mole, who o"
ften made him f
eel confused by 
her smiles and h
er own confusion
 when meeting hi
m.  It seemed 
so natural to Pi
erre that everyo
ne should like h
"im, and it
woul"
d have seemed so
 unnatural had a
nyone disliked h
"im, that he coul"
d not but belie
ve in the sincer
ity of those aro
und him. Besides
", he had
no tim"
e to ask himself
 whether these p
eople were since
re or not. He w
as always busy a
nd always felt i
n a state of mil
d and cheerful 
intoxication. He
 felt as though 
he were the cent
er of some impor
tant and genera
l movement; that
 something was c
onstantly expect
"ed of him, that "
if he did not d
o it he would gr
ieve and disappo
"int many people,"
 but if he did 
"this and that, a"
ll would be well
; and he did wha
t was demanded o
"f
him, but stil"
l that happy res
ult always remai
ned in the futur
e.  More than 
"anyone else, Pri"
nce Vasíli took
 possession of P
ierre’s affai
rs and of Pierre
 himself in thos
e early days. Fr
om the death of 
 Count Bezúkhov
 he did not let 
go his hold of t
he lad. He had t
he air of a man
 oppressed by bu
"siness, weary an"
"d suffering, who"
" yet would not, "
for pity’s sa
"ke, leave this h"
elpless youth wh
"o, after all, wa"
s the son of hi
s old friend and
 the possessor o
f such enormous 
"wealth, to the c"
aprice of fate 
and the designs 
of rogues. Durin
g the few days h
e spent in Mosc
ow after the dea
th of Count Bez�
"�khov, he would "
"call Pierre, or"
 go to him himse
"lf, and tell him"
 what ought to b
e done in a tone
 of weariness a
"nd assurance, as"
 if he were addi
ng every time: �
��You know I am
 overwhelmed wit
h business and i
t is purely out 
of charity that 
 I trouble mysel
"f about you, and"
 you also know q
uite well that w
hat I propose i
s the only thing
 possible.”  
"
“Well, my dea"
"r fellow, tomorr"
ow we are off at
" last,” said P"
rince Vasíli o
"ne day, closing "
his eyes and fin
gering Pierre’
"s elbow,
speaki"
ng as if he were
 saying somethin
g which had long
 since been agre
ed upon and cou
ld not now be al
tered. “We sta
rt tomorrow and 
I’m giving yo
u a place in my 
carriage. I am v
ery glad. All ou
r important busi
ness here is no
"w settled, and I"
 ought to have b
een off long ago
. Here is somet
hing I have rece
ived from the ch
ancellor. I aske
"d him for you, a"
nd you have bee
n entered in the
 diplomatic corp
s and made a Gen
tleman of the B
edchamber. The d
iplomatic career
 now lies open b
efore you.”  
 Notwithstanding
 the tone of wea
ried assurance w
ith which these 
words were pron
"ounced, Pierre, "
who had so long 
been considering
" his career,
wi"
shed to make som
e suggestion. Bu
t Prince Vasíli
 interrupted him
 in the special
 deep cooing ton
"e, precluding th"
e possibility of
 interrupting h
"is speech, which"
 he used in extr
eme cases when s
pecial persuasio
n was needed. 
"
“Mais, mon c"
"her, I did this "
"for my own sake,"
 to satisfy my c
"onscience,
and "
there is nothing
 to thank me for
. No one has eve
r complained yet
 of being too m
uch loved; and b
"esides, you are "
"free, you could "
throw it up tom
orrow. But you w
ill see everythi
ng for yourself 
when you get to 
 Petersburg. It 
is high time for
 you to get away
 from these terr
ible recollecti
ons.” Prince V
asíli sighed. �
"��Yes, yes, my b"
oy. And my vale
t can go in your
 carriage. Ah! I
 was nearly forg
"etting,” he ad"
ded. “You kno
"w, mon cher, you"
r father and I h
ad some accounts
" to settle, so
"
I have received 
what was due fro
m the Ryazán es
tate and will ke
ep it; you won�
��t require it. 
We’ll go into 
the accounts lat
er.”  By “
what was due fro
m the Ryazán es
tate” Prince V
asíli meant se
veral thousand r
ubles quitrent r
eceived from Pie
rre’s peasants
",
which the pri"
nce had retained
 for himself.  
"
In Petersburg, "
"as in Moscow, Pi"
erre found the s
ame atmosphere o
f gentleness an
d affection. He 
could not refuse
" the post, or ra"
ther the rank (
for he did nothi
"ng), that Prince"
 Vasíli had pro
"cured for him,
"
and acquaintance
"s, invitations, "
and social occup
ations were so n
"umerous
that, e"
ven more than in
" Moscow, he felt"
 a sense of bewi
"lderment, bustle"
",
and continual"
 expectation of 
"some good, alway"
s in front of hi
m but never att
ained.  Of his
 former bachelor
 acquaintances m
any were no long
er in Petersburg
. The Guards ha
d gone to the fr
ont; Dólokhov h
ad been reduced 
to the ranks; A
natole was in th
e army somewhere
 in the province
s; Prince Andrew
 was abroad; so
 Pierre had not 
the opportunity 
to spend his nig
hts as he used 
to like to spend
" them, or to ope"
n his mind by in
timate talks wit
h a friend olde
r than himself a
nd whom he respe
cted. His whole 
time was taken 
up with dinners 
and balls and wa
s spent chiefly 
at Prince Vasí
li’s house in 
the company of t
he stout princes
"s, his wife, and"
 his beautiful 
daughter Hélèn
e.  Like the o
"thers, Anna Páv"
lovna Schérer s
howed Pierre the
 change of atti
tude toward him 
that had taken p
lace in society.
  Formerly in 
Anna Pávlovna�
"�s presence, Pie"
rre had always f
elt that what h
e was saying was
" out of place, t"
actless and unsu
"itable, that
re"
marks which seem
ed to him clever
 while they form
ed in his mind b
ecame foolish a
s soon as he utt
"ered them, while"
 on the contrary
 Hippolyte’s 
stupidest remark
s came out cleve
r and apt. Now e
verything Pierre
 said was charm
ant. Even if Ann
a Pávlovna did 
"not say so, he c"
ould see that s
he wished to and
 only refrained 
out of regard fo
r his modesty. 
 In the beginni
ng of the winter
 of 1805-6 Pierr
e received one o
f Anna Pávlovn
a’s usual pink
 notes with an i
nvitation to whi
ch was added: �
��You will find 
the beautiful H�
"�lène here, who"
m it is always 
delightful to se
e.”  When he
 read that sente
"nce, Pierre felt"
 for the first t
ime that some l
ink which other 
people recognize
d had grown up b
etween himself a
"nd
Hélène, an"
d that thought b
"oth alarmed him,"
 as if some obli
gation were bei
ng imposed on hi
m which he could
" not fulfill, an"
d pleased him as
 an entertainin
g supposition. 
 Anna Pávlovna
’s “At Home�
�� was like the 
"former one, only"
 the novelty sh
e offered her gu
ests this time w
as not Mortemart
", but a
diploma"
tist fresh from 
Berlin with the 
very latest deta
ils of the Empe
ror Alexander’
s visit to Potsd
"am, and of how t"
he two august f
riends had pledg
ed themselves in
 an indissoluble
 alliance to uph
old the cause o
f justice agains
t the enemy of t
he human race. A
nna Pávlovna r
eceived Pierre w
ith a shade of m
"elancholy, evide"
ntly relating to
 the young man�
��s recent loss 
by the death of 
Count Bezúkhov 
(everyone const
antly considered
 it a duty to as
sure Pierre that
 he was greatly 
 afflicted by th
e death of the f
ather he had har
"dly known), and "
her melancholy 
was just like th
e august melanch
oly she showed a
t the mention o
f her most augus
t Majesty the Em
press Márya Fë
dorovna. Pierre 
felt flattered 
by this. Anna P�
�vlovna arranged
 the different g
roups in her dr
awing room with 
her habitual ski
ll. The large gr
"oup, in which we"
re Prince Vasí
li and the gener
"als, had the ben"
efit of the dipl
omat. Another g
roup was at the 
tea table. Pierr
e wished to join
" the former,
bu"
t Anna Pávlovna
—who was in th
e excited condit
ion of a command
er on a battlef
ield to whom tho
usands of new an
d brilliant idea
s occur which t
here is hardly t
ime to put in ac
tion—seeing Pi
"erre, touched hi"
s sleeve with h
"er finger, sayin"
g:  “Wait a 
"bit, I have some"
thing in view fo
r you this eveni
ng.” (She gla
nced at Hélène
 and smiled at h
er.) “My dear 
"Hélène, be
ch"
aritable to my p
oor aunt who ado
res you. Go and 
keep her company
 for ten minute
s. And that it w
ill not be too d
"ull, here is the"
 dear count who
 will not refuse
 to accompany yo
u.”  The bea
uty went to the 
"aunt, but Anna P"
ávlovna detaine
"d Pierre, lookin"
g as if she had
 to give some fi
nal necessary in
structions.  �
��Isn’t she ex
quisite?” she 
"said to Pierre, "
pointing to the 
stately beauty 
as she glided aw
ay. “And how s
he carries herse
lf! For so young
"
a girl, such t"
"act, such master"
ly perfection of
 manner! It come
s from her hear
t. Happy the man
 who wins her! W
ith her the leas
t worldly of men
 would occupy a
 most brilliant 
position in soci
ety. Don’t you
 think so? I on
ly wanted to kno
"w your opinion,�"
�� and Anna Páv
lovna let Pierre
" go.

Pierre, "
"in reply, sincer"
ely agreed with 
her as to Hélè
ne’s perfecti
on of manner. If
 he ever thought
" of Hélène, it"
 was just of he
r beauty and her
 remarkable skil
l in appearing s
ilently dignifie
d in society. 
 The old aunt r
eceived the two 
young people in 
"her corner, but "
seemed desirous
 of hiding her a
doration for Hé
lène and inclin
ed rather to sh
ow her fear of A
nna Pávlovna. S
he looked at her
" niece, as if
i"
nquiring what sh
e was to do with
 these people. O
"n leaving them, "
Anna Pávlovna 
again touched Pi
"erre’s sleeve,"
 saying: “I ho
pe you won’t 
say that it is d
ull in my house 
"again,” and sh"
e glanced at Hé
lène.  Hélè
"ne smiled, with "
a look implying 
that she did not
 admit the poss
ibility of anyon
e seeing her wit
hout being encha
nted. The aunt 
"coughed, swallow"
"ed, and said in "
French that she 
was very pleased
 to see Hélèn
"e, then she turn"
ed to Pierre wit
h the same words
 of welcome and
 the same look. 
In the middle of
 a dull and halt
ing conversation
",
Hélène turn"
ed to Pierre wit
h the beautiful 
bright smile tha
t she gave to e
veryone. Pierre 
was so used to t
"hat smile, and i"
t had so little 
 meaning for him
", that he paid n"
o attention to i
t. The aunt was 
just speaking o
f a collection o
f snuffboxes tha
t had belonged t
o Pierre’s fa
"ther, Count Bez�"
"�khov, and showe"
d them her own b
ox. Princess Hé
lène asked to 
see the portrait
 of the aunt’s
 husband on the 
box lid.  “T
hat is probably 
the work of Vine
"sse,” said Pie"
"rre, mentioning"
 a celebrated mi
"niaturist, and h"
e leaned over th
e table to take 
the snuffbox wh
ile trying to he
ar what was bein
g said at the ot
her table.  He
" half rose, mean"
"ing to go round,"
 but the aunt ha
nded him the snu
"ffbox,
passing "
it across Hélè
ne’s back. Hé
lène stooped fo
rward to make r
"oom, and looked "
round with a smi
"le. She was, as "
always at evenin
"g
parties, wear"
ing a dress such
 as was then fas
"hionable, cut ve"
ry low at front
 and back. Her b
"ust, which had a"
lways seemed lik
e marble to Pier
"re,
was so clos"
e to him that hi
s shortsighted e
yes could not bu
t perceive the 
living charm of 
her neck and sho
"ulders, so near "
to his lips that
 he need only h
ave bent his hea
d a little to ha
ve touched them.
 He was conscio
us of the warmth
" of her body, th"
e scent of perfu
"me, and the
cre"
aking of her cor
set as she moved
. He did not see
 her marble beau
ty forming a co
mplete whole wit
"h her dress, but"
 all the charm o
f her body only
 covered by her 
garments. And ha
ving once seen t
his he could not
 help being awa
"re of it, just a"
s we cannot rene
w an illusion we
 have once seen
 through.  “
So you have neve
r noticed before
 how beautiful I
 am?” Hélène
 seemed to say.
 “You had not 
noticed that I a
"m a woman? Yes, "
I am a woman wh
o may belong to 
anyone—to you 
"too,” said her"
 glance. And at 
 that moment Pie
rre felt that H�
�lène not only 
"could, but must,"
" be his
wife, a"
nd that it could
 not be otherwis
e.  He knew th
is at that momen
t as surely as i
f he had been st
anding at the a
ltar with her. H
ow and when this
 would be he did
" not know, he di"
d not even know
 if it would be 
a good thing (he
" even felt, he k"
"new not why,
th"
at it would be a
" bad thing), but"
 he knew it woul
d happen.  Pie
rre dropped his 
"eyes, lifted the"
"m again, and wis"
hed once more to
 see her as a d
istant beauty fa
r removed from h
"im, as he had se"
en her every da
"y until then, bu"
t he could no lo
nger do it. He c
"ould not, any mo"
re than a man w
ho has been look
ing at a tuft of
 steppe grass th
rough the mist 
and taking it fo
r a tree can aga
in take it for a
 tree after he h
as once recogni
zed it to be a t
uft of grass. Sh
e was terribly c
lose to him. Sh
e already had po
"wer over him, an"
d between them t
here was no long
er any barrier 
except the barri
er of his own wi
"ll.

“Well, "
I will leave you
 in your little 
"corner,” came "
Anna Pávlovna�
"��s voice, “I "
see you are all 
right there.” 
"

And Pierre, a"
nxiously trying 
to remember whet
her he had done 
anything repreh
"ensible, looked "
round with a blu
sh. It seemed to
 him that everyo
ne knew what ha
d happened to hi
m as he knew it 
himself.  A li
ttle later when 
he went up to th
"e large circle, "
Anna Pávlovna s
aid to him: “
I hear you are r
efitting your Pe
tersburg house?�
��  This was t
rue. The archite
ct had told him 
that it was nece
"ssary, and
Pier"
"re, without know"
"ing why, was hav"
ing his enormous
 Petersburg hous
e done up.  �
��That’s a goo
"d thing, but don"
’t move from P
rince Vasíli’
s. It is good t
o have a friend 
"like the prince,"
"” she said, sm"
iling at Prince 
 Vasíli. “I k
now something ab
out that. Don’
t I? And you are
 still so young
. You need advic
e. Don’t be an
gry with me for 
exercising an ol
d woman’s pri
vilege.”  Sh
"e paused, as wom"
"en always do, ex"
pecting somethin
g after they hav
e mentioned the
ir age. “If yo
u marry it will 
be a different t
"hing,”
she co"
"ntinued, uniting"
 them both in on
e glance. Pierre
 did not look at
 Hélène nor s
he at him. But s
he was just as t
erribly close to
 him. He mutter
ed something and
 colored.  Whe
n he got home he
 could not sleep
 for a long time
 for thinking of
 what had happe
ned. What had ha
ppened? Nothing.
 He had merely u
nderstood that 
the woman he had
 known as a chil
"d, of whom when "
her beauty was m
entioned he had
 said absent-min
"dedly: “Yes, s"
he’s good look
"ing,” he had
"
understood that 
this woman might
 belong to him. 
  “But she’
s stupid. I have
 myself said she
" is stupid,” h"
e thought. “T
here is somethin
"g nasty, somethi"
"ng wrong, in the"
 feeling she exc
ites in me. I h
ave been told th
at her brother A
natole was in lo
ve with her and
" she with him, t"
hat there was qu
ite a scandal an
d that that’s 
why he was sent
 away. Hippolyte
 is her brother.
.. Prince Vasíl
i is her father
... It’s bad..
..” he reflect
"ed, but while he"
 was thinking th
is (the reflect
ion was still in
"complete), he ca"
ught himself smi
ling and was co
nscious that ano
ther line of tho
ught had sprung 
"up, and while th"
inking of her w
orthlessness he 
was also dreamin
g of how she wou
"ld be his
wife,"
 how she would l
ove him become q
"uite different, "
and how all he h
ad thought and 
heard of her mig
ht be false. And
 he again saw he
r not as the da
ughter of Prince
" Vasíli, but vi"
sualized her who
le body only vei
led by its gray
 dress. “But n
o! Why did this 
thought never oc
cur to me befor
e?” and again 
he told himself 
that it was impo
"ssible, that the"
re would be som
ething unnatural
", and as it seem"
ed to him dishon
"orable, in
this"
 marriage. He re
called her forme
r words and look
s and the words 
 and looks of th
ose who had seen
 them together. 
He recalled Anna
 Pávlovna’s 
words and looks 
when she spoke t
o him about his 
"house,
recalled"
 thousands of su
ch hints from Pr
ince Vasíli and
" others, and was"
 seized by terr
or lest he had a
"lready, in some "
"way, bound himse"
lf to do someth
ing that was evi
dently wrong and
 that he ought n
ot to do. But at
 the very time 
he was expressin
g this convictio
"n to himself, in"
 another part o
f his mind her i
mage rose in all
 its womanly bea
uty.      
CHAPTER II  In
" November, 1805,"
 Prince Vasíli 
had to go on a t
our of inspectio
n in four diffe
rent provinces. 
He had arranged 
this for himself
 so as to visit
 his neglected e
states at the sa
me time and pick
 up his son Anat
ole where his r
egiment was stat
"ioned, and take "
him to visit Pri
nce Nicholas Bo
lkónski in orde
r to arrange a m
atch for him wit
h the daughter o
f that rich old
 man. But before
 leaving home an
d undertaking th
"ese new affairs,"
 Prince Vasíli
 had to settle m
atters with Pier
"re, who, it is t"
"rue, had
latter"
ly spent whole d
"ays at home, tha"
"t is, in Prince "
Vasíli’s hous
e where he was 
"staying, and had"
" been absurd, ex"
"cited, and fooli"
sh in Hélène�
��s presence (as
 a lover should 
"be), but had not"
 yet proposed t
o her.  “Thi
s is all very fi
"ne, but things m"
"ust be settled,�"
�� said Prince 
Vasíli to himse
"lf, with a sorro"
"wful sigh, one m"
"orning, feeling "
that Pierre who
 was under such 
obligations to h
im (“But never
 mind that”) 
was not behaving
 very well in th
is matter. “Yo
"uth, frivolity.."
". well,
God be "
"with him,” tho"
"ught he, relishi"
ng his own goodn
"ess of heart,
�"
��but it must be
 brought to a he
ad. The day afte
r tomorrow will 
be Lëlya’s n
ame day. I will 
invite two or th
"ree people, and "
if he does not 
understand what 
he ought to do t
hen it will be m
"y affair—yes, "
my affair. I am
 her father.” 
  Six weeks aft
er Anna Pávlovn
a’s “At Home
” and after th
e sleepless nig
ht when he had d
ecided that to m
arry Hélène wo
uld be a calamit
y and that he o
ught to avoid he
"r and go away, P"
"ierre, despite t"
"hat decision,
h"
ad not left Prin
ce Vasíli’s a
nd felt with ter
ror that in peop
le’s eyes he 
was every day mo
re and more conn
"ected with her, "
that it was imp
ossible for him 
to return to his
 former concepti
"on of her, that "
he could not br
eak away from he
"r, and that thou"
gh it would be a
 terrible thing
 he would have t
o unite his fate
 with hers. He m
ight perhaps hav
e been able to 
free himself but
 that Prince Vas
íli (who had ra
rely before giv
en receptions) n
ow hardly let a 
day go by withou
t having an even
ing party at wh
ich Pierre had t
o be present unl
ess he wished to
 spoil the gene
ral pleasure and
 disappoint ever
yone’s expecta
tion. Prince Va
"síli, in the ra"
re moments when 
"he was at home, "
would take Pierr
e’s hand in p
assing and draw 
"it downwards, or"
 absent-mindedly
 hold out his w
"rinkled, clean-s"
haven cheek for 
Pierre to kiss a
nd would say: �
"�Till
tomorrow,"
"” or, “Be in"
 to dinner or I 
shall not see yo
"u,” or, “I
"
am staying in fo
"r your sake,” "
and so on. And t
hough Prince Vas
"íli,
when he s"
tayed in (as he 
said) for Pierre
"’s sake, hardl"
y exchanged a c
ouple of words w
"ith him, Pierre "
felt unable to d
isappoint him. 
Every day he sai
d to himself one
 and the same th
ing: “It is ti
me I understood
 her and made up
 my mind what sh
e really is. Was
 I mistaken bef
"ore, or am I mis"
"taken now? No, s"
he is not stupid
", she is an exce"
"llent
girl,” "
he sometimes sai
d to himself “
she never makes 
"a mistake,
neve"
r says anything 
stupid. She says
" little, but wha"
t she does say i
s always clear 
"and simple, so s"
he is not stupid
. She never was 
abashed and is 
"not abashed now,"
 so she cannot b
e a bad woman!�
� He had often b
egun to make re
flections or thi
nk aloud in her 
"company, and she"
 had always ans
wered him either
 by a brief but 
appropriate rema
rk—showing tha
t it did not in
terest her—or 
by a silent look
 and smile which
 more palpably 
than anything el
se showed Pierre
 her superiority
. She was right 
in regarding al
l arguments as n
onsense in compa
rison with that 
smile.  She al
ways addressed h
im with a radian
tly confiding sm
ile meant for hi
"m
alone, in whi"
ch there was som
ething more sign
ificant than in 
the general smi
le that usually 
brightened her f
ace. Pierre knew
 that everyone w
as waiting for 
him to say a wor
d and cross a ce
"rtain line, and "
he knew that so
oner or later he
 would step acro
"ss it, but an in"
comprehensible t
error seized hi
m at the thought
 of that dreadfu
l step. A thousa
nd times during 
 that month and 
a half while he 
felt himself dra
wn nearer and ne
arer to that dr
"eadful abyss, Pi"
erre said to him
self: “What am
 I doing? I need
 resolution. Ca
n it be that I h
ave none?”  
He wished to tak
"e a decision, bu"
t felt with dism
ay that in this 
matter he lacke
d that strength 
of will which he
 had known in hi
mself and really
 possessed. Pie
rre was one of t
hose who are onl
y strong when th
ey feel themsel
ves quite innoce
"nt, and since th"
at day when he w
as overpowered 
by a feeling of 
desire while sto
oping over the s
nuffbox at Anna 
"
Pávlovna’s, "
an unacknowledge
d sense of the g
uilt of that des
ire paralyzed h
is will.  On H
élène’s name
" day, a small pa"
rty of just thei
r own people—a
s his wife said
—met for suppe
r at Prince Vas�
�li’s. All the
se friends and 
relations had be
en given to unde
rstand that the 
fate of the youn
g girl would be
 decided that ev
ening. The visit
ors were seated 
at supper. Prin
"cess Kurágina, "
a portly imposin
g woman who had 
once been handso
"me,
was sitting"
 at the head of 
the table. On ei
ther side of her
 sat the more i
mportant guests�
��an old general
" and his wife, a"
nd Anna Pávlovn
a Schérer. At 
the other end sa
t the younger an
d less important
" guests,
and th"
ere too sat the 
members of the f
"amily, and Pierr"
"e and Hélène,"
 side by side. P
rince Vasíli wa
s not having any
 supper: he went
 round the tabl
e in a merry moo
"d, sitting down "
"now by one, now "
"by another, of
"
the guests. To e
ach of them he m
ade some careles
s and agreeable 
remark except t
o Pierre and Hé
"lène, whose pre"
sence he seemed 
not to notice. 
He enlivened the
 whole party. Th
e wax candles bu
"rned brightly, t"
he silver and c
"rystal gleamed, "
so did the ladie
s’ toilets and

ervants in scarl
et liveries move
d round the tab
"le, the clatter "
"of plates, knive"
"s, and glasses m"
ingled with the
 animated hum of
 several convers
ations. At one e
"nd of the table,"
 the old chambe
rlain was heard 
assuring an old 
baroness that he
 loved her pass
"ionately, at whi"
ch she laughed; 
at the other cou
ld be heard the 
 story of the mi
sfortunes of som
e Mary Víktorov
na or other. At 
the center of t
"he table, Prince"
 Vasíli attract
ed everybody’s
 attention. Wit
h a facetious sm
"ile on his face,"
 he was telling 
the ladies about
 last Wednesday
’s meeting of 
the Imperial Cou
"ncil, at which S"
ergéy Kuzmích 
"
Vyazmítinov, t"
he new military 
governor general
" of Petersburg, "
had received an
d read the then 
famous rescript 
of the Emperor A
lexander from t
he army to Serg�
"�y Kuzmích, in "
which the Empero
r said that he w
as receiving fr
om all sides dec
larations of the
 people’s loya
"lty, that
the d"
eclaration from 
Petersburg gave 
him particular p
"leasure, and tha"
t he was proud 
to be at the hea
d of such a nati
on and would end
eavor to be wor
thy of it. This 
rescript began w
ith the words: �
��Sergéy Kuzmí
"ch,
From all si"
des reports reac
"h me,” etc.
"
"
“Well, and so"
 he never got fa
rther than: ‘S
ergéy Kuzmích�
��?” asked on
e of the ladies.
"

“Exactly, "
not a hair’s b
"readth farther,�"
�� answered Prin
"ce Vasíli,
lau"
"ghing, “‘Ser"
géy Kuzmích...
 From all sides.
.. From all side
s... Sergéy Ku
zmích...’ Poo
r Vyazmítinov c
ould not get any
 farther! He be
gan the rescript
 again and again
", but as soon as"
 he uttered ‘
Sergéy’ he so
"bbed, ‘Kuz-mí"
"-ch,’ tears, a"
nd ‘From all 
sides’ was smo
thered in sobs a
nd he could get 
no farther. And 
again his handk
"erchief, and aga"
in: ‘Sergéy K
"uzmích, From al"
"l sides,’...
"
"and tears, till "
at last somebody
 else was asked 
to read it.” 
 “Kuzmích...
 From all sides.
.. and then tear
"s,” someone re"
peated laughing
.  “Don’t 
"be unkind,” cr"
ied Anna Pávlov
na from her end 
of the table ho
lding up a threa
tening finger. �
��He is such a w
orthy and excell
"ent
man, our de"
ar Vyazmítinov.
...”  Everyb
ody laughed a gr
eat deal. At the
 head of the tab
"le, where the
h"
onored guests sa
"t, everyone seem"
ed to be in high
 spirits and und
er the influenc
e of a variety o
f exciting sensa
tions. Only Pier
re and Hélène
 sat silently si
de by side almos
t at the bottom 
"of the table, a"
 suppressed smil
e brightening bo
"th their faces, "
a smile that had
 nothing to do 
with Sergéy Kuz
mích—a smile 
of bashfulness a
t their own fee
lings. But much 
as all the rest 
"laughed, talked,"
" and joked, much"
 as they enjoye
d their Rhine wi
"ne, sauté, and "
"ices, and howeve"
r they avoided 
looking at the y
"oung couple, and"
 heedless and un
observant as th
ey seemed of the
"m, one could fee"
l by the occasio
nal glances they
 gave that the 
story about Serg
"éy Kuzmích, th"
"e laughter, and "
the food were a
"ll a pretense, a"
nd that the whol
e attention of t
hat company was 
 directed to—P
ierre and Hélè
ne. Prince Vasí
li mimicked the 
sobbing of Serg
éy Kuzmích and
 at the same tim
e his eyes glanc
ed toward his d
"aughter, and whi"
le he laughed th
e expression on 
his face clearly
 said: “Yes..
. it’s getting
" on, it will all"
 be settled toda
y.” Anna Páv
lovna threatened
 him on behalf o
f “our dear Vy
"azmítinov,” a"
"nd
in her eyes,"
" which, for an i"
"nstant, glanced "
"at Pierre, Princ"
e Vasíli read 
a congratulation
 on his future s
on-in-law and on
 his daughter’
s happiness. Th
e old princess s
ighed sadly as s
he offered some 
wine to the old
 lady next to he
r and glanced an
grily at her dau
"ghter, and her s"
igh seemed to s
"ay: “Yes, ther"
e’s nothing le
ft for you and m
e but to sip sw
"eet wine, my dea"
"r, now that the "
time has come fo
r these young on
es to be thus b
"oldly, provocati"
vely happy.” �
��And what nonse
nse all this is 
 that I am sayin
g!” thought a 
"diplomatist, gla"
ncing at the hap
py faces of the
 lovers. “That
’s happiness!�
��  Into the i
"nsignificant, tr"
"ifling, and arti"
ficial interests
 uniting that s
ociety had enter
ed the simple fe
eling of the att
raction of a hea
lthy and handso
me young man and
 woman for one a
nother. And this
 human feeling 
dominated everyt
hing else and so
ared above all t
heir affected ch
atter. Jests fe
"ll flat, news wa"
s not interestin
"g, and the anima"
tion was eviden
tly forced. Not 
only the guests 
but even the foo
tmen waiting at 
 table seemed to
" feel this, and "
they forgot thei
r duties as they
 looked at the 
beautiful Hélè
ne with her radi
ant face and at 
"the red, broad,"
 and happy thoug
h uneasy face of
 Pierre. It seem
ed as if the ver
y light of the 
candles was focu
sed on those two
 happy faces alo
ne.  Pierre fe
lt that he was t
he center of it 
"all, and this bo"
th pleased and 
embarrassed him.
 He was like a m
an entirely abso
rbed in some occ
upation. He did
" not see, hear, "
or understand an
ything clearly. 
Only now and th
en detached idea
s and impression
s from the world
 of reality shot
 unexpectedly t
hrough his mind.
  “So it is 
all finished!”
 he thought. “
And how has it a
ll happened? Ho
w quickly! Now I
 know that not b
ecause of her al
"one, nor of myse"
"lf
alone, but b"
ecause of everyo
"ne, it must inev"
itably come abou
t. They are all
" expecting it, t"
hey are so sure 
that it will hap
pen that I canno
"t, I
cannot, di"
sappoint them. B
ut how will it b
e? I do not know
", but it
will c"
ertainly happen!
” thought Pier
"re, glancing at "
those dazzling 
shoulders close 
to his eyes.  
Or he would sudd
enly feel ashame
d of he knew not
 what. He felt i
t awkward to at
tract everyone�
�s attention and
 to be considere
d a lucky man a
"nd, with his pla"
"in face, to be l"
ooked on as a so
rt of Paris pos
sessed of a Hele
n. “But no dou
bt it always is 
and must be so!�
�� he consoled 
himself. “And 
"besides, what ha"
ve I done to bri
ng it about? Ho
w did it begin? 
I traveled from 
Moscow with Prin
ce Vasíli. Then
 there was noth
ing. So why shou
ld I not stay at
 his house? Then
 I played cards 
 with her and pi
cked up her reti
cule and drove o
ut with her. How
" did it
begin, "
when did it all 
come about?” A
nd here he was s
itting by her s
ide as her betro
"thed, seeing, he"
"aring, feeling h"
"er nearness, her"
"
breathing, her"
" movements, her "
beauty. Then it 
would suddenly s
eem to him that
 it was not she 
but he was so un
usually beautifu
"l, and that that"
 was why they a
ll looked so at 
"him, and flatter"
ed by this gener
al admiration h
e would expand h
"is chest, raise "
"his head, and re"
joice at his goo
d fortune. Sudd
enly he heard a 
familiar voice r
epeating somethi
ng to him a sec
ond time. But Pi
erre was so abso
rbed that he did
 not understand 
what was said. 
  “I am askin
g you when you l
ast heard from B
"olkónski,” re"
peated Prince V
asíli a third t
ime. “How abse
nt-minded you ar
"e, my dear
fell"
ow.”  Prince
" Vasíli smiled,"
 and Pierre noti
ced that everyon
e was smiling at
 him and Hélè
"ne. “Well, wha"
"t of it, if you "
all know it?” 
thought Pierre.
 “What of it? 
It’s the truth
!” and he hims
elf smiled his 
gentle childlike
" smile, and Hél"
ène smiled too.
  “When did 
you get the lett
er? Was it from 
Olmütz?” repe
ated Prince Vas
"íli, who preten"
ded to want to k
now this in orde
r to settle a d
ispute.  “Ho
w can one talk o
r think of such 
trifles?” thou
ght Pierre.  �
"��Yes, from Olm�"
"�tz,” he answe"
"red, with a sigh"
.  After suppe
r Pierre with hi
s partner follow
ed the others in
to the drawing 
room. The guests
 began to disper
"se, some without"
 taking leave o
f Hélène. Some
", as if unwillin"
g to distract he
r from an import
"ant
occupation,"
 came up to her 
for a moment and
 made haste to g
"o away,
refusin"
g to let her see
 them off. The d
iplomatist prese
rved a mournful 
 silence as he l
eft the drawing 
room. He picture
d the vanity of 
his diplomatic 
career in compar
ison with Pierre
’s happiness. 
The old general
 grumbled at his
 wife when she a
sked how his leg
" was. “Oh, the"
"
old fool,” h"
e thought. “Th
at Princess Hél
ène will be bea
utiful still wh
en she’s fifty
.”  “I thi
nk I may congrat
"ulate you,” wh"
ispered Anna Pá
vlovna to the o
"ld princess, kis"
sing her soundly
. “If I hadn�
�t this headache
 I’d have sta
yed longer.” 
 The old prince
ss did not reply
", she was tormen"
ted by jealousy 
of her daughter
’s happiness. 
  While the gue
sts were taking 
their leave Pier
re remained for 
a long time alo
ne with Hélène
 in the little d
rawing room wher
e they were sitt
ing. He had oft
"en before, durin"
g the last six w
"eeks, remained a"
"lone with her,
"
but had never sp
oken to her of l
ove. Now he felt
 that it was ine
"vitable,
but he"
 could not make 
up his mind to t
ake the final st
ep. He felt ash
amed; he felt th
at he was occupy
ing someone else
’s place here 
 beside Hélène
. “This happin
ess is not for y
"ou,” some inne"
r voice whisper
ed to him. “Th
is happiness is 
for those who ha
ve not in them 
what there is in
" you.”

But,"
 as he had to sa
"y something, he "
began by asking 
her whether she 
was satisfied w
ith the party. S
he replied in he
r usual simple m
anner that this
 name day of her
s had been one o
f the pleasantes
t she had ever h
ad.  Some of t
he nearest relat
ives had not yet
 left. They were
 sitting in the
 large drawing r
oom. Prince Vas�
�li came up to P
ierre with langu
id footsteps. P
ierre rose and s
aid it was getti
ng late. Prince 
Vasíli gave hi
m a look of ster
"n inquiry, as th"
ough what Pierre
 had just said w
as so strange t
hat one could no
t take it in. Bu
t then the expre
ssion of severi
"ty changed, and "
he drew Pierre�
�s hand downward
"s, made him sit"
"
down, and smile"
d affectionately
".

“Well, L�"
�lya?” he aske
"d, turning insta"
ntly to his daug
hter and addres
sing her with th
e careless tone 
of habitual tend
erness natural t
o parents who h
ave petted their
 children from b
"abyhood, but whi"
ch Prince Vasí
li had only acqu
ired by imitatin
g other parents.
  And he again
 turned to Pierr
e.  “Sergéy
 Kuzmích—From
 all sides—”
" he said, unbutt"
oning the top b
utton of his wai
stcoat.  Pierr
"e smiled, but hi"
s smile showed t
hat he knew it w
as not the story
 about Sergéy 
Kuzmích that in
terested Prince 
Vasíli just the
"n, and
Prince V"
asíli saw that 
Pierre knew this
. He suddenly mu
ttered somethin
g and went away.
 It seemed to Pi
erre that even t
he prince was d
isconcerted. The
 sight of the di
scomposure of th
at old man of th
e world touched
 Pierre: he look
ed at Hélène a
nd she too seeme
"d disconcerted,"
 and her look se
emed to say: “
"Well, it is your"
 own fault.” 
 “The step mu
st be taken but 
"I cannot, I cann"
ot!” thought P
"ierre,
and he a"
gain began speak
ing about indiff
"erent matters, a"
bout Sergéy Ku
"zmích, asking w"
hat the point of
 the story was a
s he had not hea
rd it properly.
 Hélène answer
ed with a smile 
that she too had
 missed it.  W
hen Prince Vasí
li returned to t
"he drawing room,"
" the princess, h"
"is
wife, was ta"
lking in low ton
es to the elderl
y lady about Pie
rre.  “Of co
"urse, it is a ve"
ry brilliant mat
"ch, but happines"
"s, my dear...”"
  “Marriages
 are made in hea
"ven,” replied "
the elderly lady
.  Prince Vas�
"�li passed by, s"
eeming not to he
"ar the ladies, a"
nd sat down on 
a sofa in a far 
corner of the ro
om. He closed hi
s eyes and seeme
d to be dozing.
 His head sank f
orward and then 
he roused himsel
"f.

“Aline,�"
�� he said to hi
"s wife, “go an"
d see what they 
are about.”  
 The princess we
nt up to the doo
"r, passed by it "
with a dignified
 and indifferen
"t air, and glanc"
ed into the litt
le drawing room.
 Pierre and Hé
lène still sat 
talking just as 
before.  “St
"ill the same,”"
 she said to her
 husband.  Pri
nce Vasíli frow
"ned, twisting hi"
"s mouth, his che"
eks quivered and
 his face assum
"ed the coarse, u"
npleasant expres
sion peculiar to
 him. Shaking h
"imself, he rose,"
 threw back his 
"head, and with r"
esolute steps we
nt past the lad
ies into the lit
tle drawing room
. With quick ste
ps he went joyf
ully up to Pierr
e. His face was 
so unusually tri
umphant that Pie
rre rose in ala
rm on seeing it.
  “Thank God
!” said Prince
 Vasíli. “My 
wife has told me
 everything!”
 (He put one arm
 around Pierre a
nd the other aro
und his daughte
r.)—“My dear
 boy... Lëlya..
. I am very plea
sed.” (His vo
ice trembled.) �
��I loved your f
ather... and she
 will make you a
 good wife... G
od bless you!...
”  He embrac
"ed his daughter,"
 and then again 
"Pierre, and kiss"
ed him with his 
 malodorous mout
h. Tears actuall
y moistened his 
cheeks.  “Pr
"incess, come her"
e!” he shouted
.  The old pri
ncess came in an
d also wept. The
 elderly lady wa
s using her han
dkerchief too. P
ierre was kissed
", and he kissed "
the beautiful H
élène’s hand
 several times. 
After a while th
ey were left alo
ne again.  �
�All this had to
 be and could no
"t be otherwise,�"
�� thought Pierr
"e,
“so it is "
useless to ask w
hether it is goo
d or bad. It is 
good because it
’s definite an
d one is rid of 
the old tormenti
ng doubt.” Pie
rre held the ha
nd of his betrot
"hed in silence, "
looking at her b
eautiful bosom 
as it rose and f
ell.  “Hél�
�ne!” he said 
aloud and paused
.  “Somethin
g special is alw
ays said in such
" cases,” he th"
"ought, but
coul"
d not remember w
hat it was that 
people say. He l
ooked at her fac
e. She drew nea
rer to him. Her 
face flushed.  
"
“Oh, take tho"
se off... those.
"..” she said, "
pointing to his 
 spectacles.  
Pierre took them
" off, and his ey"
"es, besides the "
strange look eye
s have from whi
ch spectacles ha
ve just been rem
"oved, had also a"
 frightened and 
 inquiring look.
 He was about to
 stoop over her 
hand and kiss it
", but
with a ra"
"pid, almost brut"
al movement of h
"er head, she int"
ercepted his li
ps and met them 
with her own. He
r face struck Pi
"erre, by its alt"
"ered,
unpleasan"
tly excited expr
ession.  “It
 is too late now
", it’s done; b"
esides I love he
"r,” thought
P"
ierre.  “Je 
vous aime!” * 
"he said, remembe"
ring what has to
 be said at such
 moments: but h
is words sounded
 so weak that he
 felt ashamed of
 himself.     
 * “I love you
.”   Six we
eks later he was
" married, and se"
ttled in Count B
ezúkhov’s la
"rge, newly furni"
shed Petersburg 
"house, the happy"
" possessor, as p"
"eople
said, of "
a wife who was a
 celebrated beau
ty and of millio

    CHAPTER 
III  Old Princ
e Nicholas Bolk�
�nski received a
 letter from Pri
nce Vasíli in 
"November, 1805, "
announcing that 
he and his son w
ould be paying h
im a visit. “
I am starting on
 a journey of in
"spection, and of"
 course I shall
 think nothing o
f an extra seven
ty miles to come
 and see you at 
"
the same time, "
my honored benef
"actor,” wrote "
Prince Vasíli. 
“My son Anato
le is accompanyi
ng me on his way
" to the army, so"
 I hope you will
 allow him pers
onally to expres
s the deep respe
"ct that, emulati"
"ng his
father, "
he feels for you
.”  “It se
ems that there w
ill be no need t
o bring Mary out
", suitors are
c"
oming to us of t
"heir own accord,"
” incautiously
 remarked the li
ttle princess o
n hearing the ne
ws.  Prince Ni
"cholas frowned, "
but said nothing
.  A fortnight
 after the lette
r Prince Vasíli
’s servants ca
me one evening 
in advance of hi
"m, and he and hi"
s son arrived ne
xt day.  Old B
olkónski had al
ways had a poor 
opinion of Princ
e Vasíli’s c
"haracter, but mo"
"re so recently, "
since in the new
 reigns of Paul 
and Alexander P
rince Vasíli ha
d risen to high 
position and hon
"ors. And now,
f"
rom the hints co
ntained in his l
etter and given 
by the little pr
"incess,
he saw "
which way the wi
"nd was blowing, "
and his low opin
ion changed into
 a feeling of c
ontemptuous ill 
will. He snorted
 whenever he men
tioned him. On 
the day of Princ
e Vasíli’s ar
"rival, Prince Bo"
lkónski was pa
rticularly disco
ntented and out 
of temper. Wheth
er he was in a b
ad temper becau
se Prince Vasíl
"i was coming, or"
 whether his bei
ng in a bad tem
per made him spe
cially annoyed a
t Prince Vasíli
"’s visit, he w"
as in a bad tem
"per, and in the "
morning Tíkhon 
had already advi
sed the archite
ct not to go to 
the prince with 
his report.  �
��Do you hear ho
w he’s walking
?” said Tíkho
"n, drawing the
"
architect’s at
tention to the s
ound of the prin
ce’s footsteps
. “Stepping f
lat on his heels
—we know what 
that means....�
"�

However, at"
 nine o’clock 
"the prince, in h"
is velvet coat w
ith a sable col
"lar and cap, wen"
t out for his us
ual walk. It had
 snowed the day 
 before and the 
path to the hoth
"ouse, along whic"
h the prince was
 in the habit o
"f walking, had b"
een swept: the m
arks of the broo
m were still vi
sible in the sno
w and a shovel h
ad been left sti
cking in one of 
the soft snowba
nks that bordere
d both sides of 
the path. The pr
ince went throu
gh the conservat
"ories, the serfs"
"’ quarters, an"
d the outbuildin
"gs,
frowning an"
d silent.  “
Can a sleigh pas
s?” he asked h
"is overseer, a v"
"enerable man,
r"
esembling his ma
ster in manners 
"and looks, who w"
as accompanying 
him back to the
 house.  “Th
e snow is deep. 
I am having the 
"avenue swept, yo"
ur honor.”  
The prince bowed
 his head and we
nt up to the por
ch. “God be t
"hanked,” thoug"
"ht the overseer,"
 “the storm ha
s blown over!”
  “It would 
have been hard t
"o drive up, your"
" honor,” he ad"
ded. “I heard
", your honor, th"
at a minister is
 coming to visit
 your honor.” 
  The prince tu
rned round to th
e overseer and f
ixed his eyes on
" him,
frowning."
  “What? A m
inister? What mi
nister? Who gave
 orders?” he s
aid in his shri
"ll, harsh voice."
 “The road is 
not swept for th
e princess my d
"aughter, but for"
 a minister! For
" me, there are n"
o ministers!” 
  “Your honor
", I thought...�"
�  “You thou
ght!” shouted 
"the prince, his "
words coming mor
e and more rapi
dly and indistin
ctly. “You tho
ught!... Rascals
! Blackguards!..
. I’ll teach 
you to think!”
 and lifting his
 stick he swung 
it and would ha
ve hit Alpátych
", the overseer, "
had not the latt
er instinctively
 avoided the bl
ow. “Thought..
. Blackguards...
” shouted the 
prince rapidly.
  But although
" Alpátych, frig"
htened at his ow
n temerity in av
oiding the stro
"ke, came up to t"
"he prince, bowin"
g his bald head 
resignedly befor
"e
him, or perha"
ps for that very
" reason, the pri"
"nce, though he c"
ontinued to sho
ut: “Blackguar
ds!... Throw the
 snow back on th
e road!” did n
ot lift his sti
ck again but hur
ried into the ho
use.  Before d
"inner, Princess "
Mary and Mademoi
"selle Bourienne,"
 who knew that 
the prince was i
"n a bad humor, s"
tood awaiting hi
m; Mademoiselle 
 Bourienne with 
a radiant face t
hat said: “I k
"now nothing, I a"
m the same as u
"sual,” and Pri"
"ncess Mary pale,"
" frightened, and"
 with downcast 
eyes. What she f
ound hardest to 
bear was to know
 that on such oc
casions she oug
ht to behave lik
e Mademoiselle B
"ourienne, but co"
uld not. She th
ought: “If I s
eem not to notic
e he will think 
that I do not s
ympathize with h
im; if I seem sa
d and out of spi
"rits myself, he "
will say (as he
 has done before
) that I’m in 
the dumps.”  
 The prince look
ed at his daught
er’s frightene
d face and snort
ed.  “Fool..
. or dummy!” h
e muttered.  �
��And the other 
one is not here.
 They’ve been 
"telling tales,�"
� he thought—
referring to the
 little princess
 who was not in 
the dining room
.  “Where is
 the princess?�
� he asked. “H
iding?”  “
She is not very 
"well,” answere"
d Mademoiselle B
ourienne with a
" bright smile, �"
��so she won’t
 come down. It i
s natural in her
 state.”  �
��Hm! Hm!” mut
tered the prince
", sitting down."
  His plate see
med to him not q
"uite clean, and "
pointing to a sp
ot he flung it 
away. Tíkhon ca
ught it and hand
ed it to a footm
an. The little 
princess was not
" unwell, but had"
 such an overpow
ering fear of th
"e prince
that, "
hearing he was i
"n a bad humor, s"
he had decided n
ot to appear.  
 “I am afraid 
"for the baby,”"
 she said to Mad
emoiselle Bourie
nne: “Heaven 
knows what a fri
ght might do.”
  In general a
t Bald Hills the
 little princess
 lived in consta
"nt fear, and
wi"
th a sense of an
tipathy to the o
ld prince which 
she did not rea
lize because the
 fear was so muc
h the stronger f
eeling. The prin
ce reciprocated
" this antipathy,"
 but it was over
powered by his c
ontempt for her
. When the littl
e princess had g
rown accustomed 
to life at Bald 
"
Hills, she took"
 a special fancy
 to Mademoiselle
" Bourienne, spen"
t whole days wi
"th her, asked he"
r to sleep in he
"r room, and ofte"
n talked with he
r about the old
 prince and crit
icized him.  �
��So we are to h
"ave visitors, mo"
n prince?” rem
arked Mademoisel
"le
Bourienne, u"
nfolding her whi
te napkin with h
er rosy fingers.
 “His Excelle
ncy Prince Vasí
li Kurágin and 
"his son, I under"
stand?” she s
aid inquiringly.
  “Hm!—his
 excellency is a
 puppy.... I got
 him his appoint
ment in the ser
"vice,” said th"
e prince disdain
fully. “Why hi
s son is coming 
I don’t under
stand. Perhaps P
rincess Elizabet
h and Princess M
ary know. I don
’t want him.�
� (He looked at 
his blushing dau
ghter.) “Are y
ou unwell today
? Eh? Afraid of 
the ‘minister�
�� as that idiot
 Alpátych call
ed him this morn
ing?”  “No
", mon père.”"
  Though Mademo
iselle Bourienne
 had been so uns
uccessful in her
 choice of a su
"bject, she did n"
"ot stop talking,"
 but chattered a
bout the conser
vatories and the
 beauty of a flo
wer that had jus
"t opened, and
a"
fter the soup th
e prince became 
more genial.  
"After dinner, he"
 went to see his
 daughter-in-law
. The little pri
ncess was sitti
ng at a small ta
"ble, chattering "
"with Másha, her"
 maid. She grew 
 pale on seeing 
her father-in-la
w.  She was mu
ch altered. She 
was now plain ra
ther than pretty
. Her cheeks ha
"d sunk, her lip "
"was drawn up, an"
d her eyes drawn
 down.  “Yes
", I feel a kind "
"of oppression,�"
� she said in re
ply to the prin
ce’s question 
as to how she fe
lt.  “Do you
 want anything?�
"��

“No, mer"
"ci, mon père.�"
"�

“Well, al"
"l right, all rig"
ht.”  He lef
t the room and w
ent to the waiti
ng room where Al
pátych stood wi
th bowed head. 
  “Has the sn
ow been shoveled
 back?”  “
"Yes, your excell"
ency. Forgive me
 for heaven’s 
sake... It was o
nly my stupidit
y.”  “All 
"right, all right"
",” interrupted"
" the prince, and"
 laughing his u
"nnatural way, he"
 stretched out h
is hand for Alp�
"�tych to kiss, a"
nd then proceed
ed to his study.
  Prince Vasí
li arrived that 
evening. He was 
met in the avenu
e by coachmen a
"nd footmen, who,"
 with loud shout
"s, dragged his s"
leighs up to on
e of the lodges 
over the road pu
rposely laden wi
th snow.  Prin
ce Vasíli and A
natole had separ
ate rooms assign
ed to them.  A
"natole, having t"
aken off his ove
"rcoat, sat with "
arms akimbo befo
re a table on a
 corner of which
 he smilingly an
d absent-mindedl
y fixed his lar
ge and handsome 
eyes. He regarde
d his whole life
 as a continual 
round of amusem
ent which someon
e for some reaso
n had to provide
 for him. And h
e looked on this
 visit to a chur
lish old man and
 a rich and ugly
 heiress in the
 same way. All t
"his might, he th"
"ought, turn out "
very well and a
musingly. “And
 why not marry h
er if she really
 has so much mon
ey? That never 
"does any harm,�"
� thought Anatol
e.  He shaved 
and scented hims
elf with the car
e and elegance w
hich had become
 habitual to him
" and, his handso"
me head held hig
"h, entered his
"
father’s room 
with the good-hu
mored and victor
ious air natural
 to him. Prince
 Vasíli’s two
 valets were bus
"y dressing him, "
and he looked r
ound with much a
nimation and che
erfully nodded t
o his son as the
 latter entered
", as if to say: "
"“Yes, that’s"
 how I want you 
to look.”  �
"��I say, Father,"
" joking apart, i"
s she very hideo
us?” Anatole a
"sked,
as if con"
tinuing a conver
sation the subje
ct of which had 
often been ment
ioned during the
 journey.  “
Enough! What non
sense! Above all
", try to be resp"
ectful and cauti
ous with the ol
d prince.”  
“If he starts 
a row I’ll go 
"away,” said Pr"
ince Anatole. �
�I can’t bear
 those old men! 
Eh?”  “Rem
"ember, for you e"
verything depend
s on this.”  
 In the meantime
", not only was i"
t known in the m
aidservants’ r
ooms that the m
inister and his 
"son had arrived,"
 but the appeara
nce of both had 
 been minutely d
escribed. Prince
ss Mary was sitt
ing alone in her
" room,
vainly t"
rying to master 
her agitation. 
 “Why did the
"y write, why did"
 Lise tell me ab
out it? It can n
ever happen!”
" she said, looki"
ng at herself in
 the glass. “H
ow shall I ente
r the drawing ro
om? Even if I li
ke him I can’t
 now be myself w
ith him.” The
 mere thought of
 her father’s 
look filled her 
with terror. Th
e little princes
s and Mademoisel
le Bourienne had
 already receive
"d
from Másha, "
the lady’s mai
"d, the necessary"
 report of how h
andsome the min
ister’s son wa
"s, with his rosy"
 cheeks and dark
" eyebrows, and w"
ith what diffic
ulty the father 
had dragged his 
legs upstairs wh
ile the son had
 followed him li
"ke an eagle, thr"
ee steps at a ti
me. Having recei
ved this inform
"ation, the littl"
e princess and M
ademoiselle Bour
"ienne, whose
ch"
attering voices 
had reached her 
from the corrido
"r, went into Pri"
ncess Mary’s 
room.  “You 
know they’ve c
"ome, Marie?” s"
aid the little p
"rincess, waddlin"
"g
in, and sinki"
ng heavily into 
an armchair.  
She was no longe
r in the loose g
own she generall
y wore in the mo
"rning,
but had "
on one of her be
st dresses. Her 
hair was careful
ly done and her 
 face was animat
"ed, which, howev"
"er, did not conc"
eal its sunken a
nd faded outlin
es. Dressed as s
he used to be in
 Petersburg soci
"ety, it was stil"
l more noticeab
le how much plai
ner she had beco
me. Some unobtru
sive touch had 
been added to Ma
demoiselle Bouri
enne’s toilet 
which rendered h
er fresh and pr
etty face yet mo
re attractive. 
 “What! Are y
ou going to rema
"in as you are, d"
ear princess?”
 she began. “
They’ll be ann
ouncing that the
 gentlemen are i
n the drawing r
oom and we shall
 have to go down
", and you have n"
ot smartened you
rself up at all
!”  The litt
le princess got 
"up, rang for the"
" maid, and hurri"
edly and merrily
 began to devis
e and carry out 
a plan of how Pr
incess Mary shou
ld be dressed. 
Princess Mary’
s self-esteem wa
s wounded by the
 fact that the 
arrival of a sui
tor agitated her
", and still more"
 so by both her
 companions’ n
ot having the le
ast conception t
hat it could be 
 otherwise. To t
ell them that sh
e felt ashamed f
or herself and f
or them would b
e to betray her 
"agitation, while"
 to decline thei
r offers to dre
ss her would pro
long their bante
r and insistence
". She flushed, h"
er beautiful ey
"es grew dim, red"
 blotches came o
"n her face, and "
it took on the 
unattractive mar
tyrlike expressi
on it so often w
"ore, as she
sub"
mitted herself t
o Mademoiselle B
ourienne and Lis
e. Both these wo
men quite since
rely tried to ma
ke her look pret
ty. She was so p
lain that neith
er of them could
 think of her as
" a rival, so the"
y began dressing
 her with perfe
"ct sincerity, an"
d with the naïv
e and firm convi
ction women hav
e that dress can
 make a face pre
tty.  “No re
"ally, my dear, t"
his dress is not
" pretty,” said"
" Lise, looking
"
sideways at Prin
cess Mary from a
 little distance
. “You have a 
"maroon
dress, h"
ave it fetched. 
Really! You know
 the fate of you
r whole life may
 be at stake. B
ut this one is t
"oo light, it’s"
 not becoming!�
�  It was not 
"the dress, but t"
he face and whol
e figure of Prin
cess Mary that 
"was not pretty, "
but neither Made
moiselle Bourien
ne nor the littl
e princess felt
 this; they stil
l thought that i
f a blue ribbon 
were placed in 
"the hair, the ha"
"ir combed up, an"
d the blue scarf
 arranged lower 
on the best mar
"oon dress, and s"
"o on, all would "
be well. They fo
rgot that the f
rightened face a
nd the figure co
uld not be alter
"ed, and that
ho"
wever they might
 change the sett
ing and adornmen
"t of that face, "
it would still 
remain piteous a
nd plain. After 
two or three cha
nges to which P
rincess Mary mee
"kly submitted, j"
ust as her hair 
had been arrange
d on the top of
 her head (a sty
le that quite al
tered and spoile
d her looks) an
d she had put on
 a maroon dress 
with a pale-blue
" scarf, the
lit"
tle princess wal
ked twice round 
"her, now adjusti"
ng a fold of the
 dress with her
" little hand, no"
w arranging the 
scarf and lookin
g at her with h
er head bent fir
st on one side a
nd then on the o
"ther.

“No, "
"it will not do,�"
�� she said deci
"dedly, clasping "
her hands. “No
",
Mary, really "
this dress does 
not suit you. I 
prefer you in yo
ur little gray 
everyday dress. 
"Now please, do i"
t for my sake. K
"atie,” she sai"
"d
to the maid, "
“bring the pri
ncess her gray d
"ress, and you’"
"ll see,
Mademoi"
"selle Bourienne,"
 how I shall arr
"ange it,” she "
"added, smiling
"
with a foretaste
 of artistic ple
asure.  But wh
en Katie brought
 the required dr
"ess, Princess Ma"
ry remained sit
ting motionless 
before the glass
", looking at her"
" face, and saw i"
n the mirror he
r eyes full of t
ears and her mou
"th quivering, re"
ady to burst in
to sobs.  “C
"ome, dear prince"
"ss,” said Made"
moiselle Bourien
"ne, “just one "
more little eff
ort.”  The l
"ittle princess, "
taking the dress
" from the maid, "
came up to Princ
ess Mary.  �
"�Well, now we’"
ll arrange somet
hing quite simpl
"e and becoming,�"
�� she said.  
 The three voice
"s, hers, Mademoi"
selle Bourienne�
"��s, and Katie�"
"�s, who
was lau"
ghing at somethi
"ng, mingled in a"
" merry sound, li"
ke the chirping 
 of birds.  �
"�No, leave me al"
"one,” said Pri"
ncess Mary.  H
er voice sounded
 so serious and 
so sad that the 
chirping of the 
birds was silen
ced at once. The
y looked at the 
"beautiful, large"
", thoughtful
ey"
es full of tears
 and of thoughts
", gazing shining"
ly and imploring
"ly at
them, and"
 understood that
 it was useless 
and even cruel t
o insist.  “
"At least, change"
" your coiffure,�"
�� said the litt
le princess. �
�Didn’t I tell
" you,” she wen"
"t on, turning re"
proachfully to 
Mademoiselle Bou
"rienne, “Mary�"
��s is a face wh
ich such a coiff
ure does not su
it in the least.
 Not in the leas
t! Please change
 it.”  “Le
"ave me alone, pl"
ease leave me al
one! It is all q
uite the same to
"
me,” answere"
d a voice strugg
ling with tears.
  Mademoiselle
 Bourienne and t
he little prince
ss had to own to
 themselves tha
t Princess Mary 
in this guise lo
"oked very plain,"
 worse than usua
"l,
but it was t"
oo late. She was
 looking at them
 with an express
ion they both k
"new, an expressi"
on thoughtful an
d sad. This expr
ession in Prince
ss Mary did not
 frighten them (
she never inspir
ed fear in anyon
"e), but they
kn"
ew that when it 
appeared on her 
"face, she became"
 mute and was no
t to be shaken 
in her determina
tion.  “You 
"will change it, "
won’t you?” 
said Lise. And a
s Princess Mary 
"
gave no answer,"
 she left the ro
om.  Princess 
Mary was left al
one. She did not
 comply with Lis
"e’s request,
"
she not only lef
t her hair as it
" was, but did no"
t even look in h
er glass. Letti
ng her arms fall
" helplessly, she"
 sat with downca
st eyes and pon
dered. A husband
", a man, a stron"
g dominant and s
trangely attract
ive being rose 
in her imaginati
"on, and carried "
her into a total
ly different ha
ppy world of his
 own. She fancie
"d a child, her o"
wn—such as she
 had seen the d
ay before in the
 arms of her nur
se’s daughter�
��at her own br
"east, the husban"
d standing by an
d gazing tenderl
y at her and the
 child. “But 
"no, it is imposs"
"ible, I am too u"
"gly,” she thou"
ght.  “Pleas
e come to tea. T
he prince will b
e out in a momen
"t,” came the
"
maid’s voice a
t the door.  S
he roused hersel
"f, and felt appa"
lled at what she
 had been thinki
"ng, and
before "
going down she w
ent into the roo
m where the icon
"s hung and, her"
 eyes fixed on t
he dark face of 
a large icon of 
the Saviour lit 
"by a
lamp, she "
stood before it 
with folded hand
s for a few mome
nts. A painful 
doubt filled her
 soul. Could the
" joy of love, of"
 earthly love fo
"r a
man, be for"
 her? In her tho
ughts of marriag
e Princess Mary 
dreamed of happ
iness and of chi
"ldren, but her s"
"trongest, most d"
eeply hidden lon
ging was for ea
rthly love. The 
more she tried t
o hide this feel
ing from others
 and even from h
"erself, the stro"
nger it grew. �
"�O God,” she
"
"said, “how am "
I to stifle in m
y heart these te
mptations of the
 devil? How am 
I to renounce fo
rever these vile
" fancies, so as "
peacefully to f
ulfill Thy will?
” And scarcely
 had she put tha
t question than 
God gave her th
e answer in her 
own heart. “De
sire nothing for
" thyself,
seek "
"nothing, be not "
anxious or envio
us. Man’s futu
re and thy own f
ate must remain
 hidden from the
"e, but live so t"
hat thou mayest 
be ready for an
ything. If it be
 God’s will to
 prove thee in t
he duties of mar
"riage,
be ready"
 to fulfill His 
will.” With th
is consoling tho
ught (but yet w
ith a hope for t
he fulfillment o
f her forbidden 
earthly longing)
 Princess Mary 
"sighed, and havi"
ng crossed herse
"lf went down, th"
inking neither 
of her gown and 
coiffure nor of 
how she would go
 in nor of what 
 she would say. 
What could all t
hat matter in co
mparison with th
"e will of
God, "
without Whose ca
re not a hair of
 man’s head ca
n fall?     
  CHAPTER IV  
 When Princess M
"ary came down, P"
rince Vasíli an
d his son were a
lready in the d
"rawing room, tal"
king to the litt
le princess and 
Mademoiselle Bo
urienne. When sh
e entered with h
"er heavy step, t"
reading on her h
"eels,
the gentl"
emen and Mademoi
selle Bourienne 
rose and the lit
"tle princess,
i"
ndicating her to
" the gentlemen, "
said: “Voilà 
Marie!” Prince
ss Mary saw the
m all and saw th
em in detail. Sh
e saw Prince Vas
"íli’s face,
"
serious for an i
nstant at the si
"ght of her, but "
immediately smil
"ing
again, and "
the little princ
ess curiously no
ting the impress
ion “Marie”
 produced on the
 visitors. And s
he saw Mademoise
"lle
Bourienne, "
with her ribbon 
"and pretty face,"
 and her unusual
ly animated loo
k which was fixe
"d on him, but hi"
m she could not 
"see, she only sa"
w something lar
"ge, brilliant, a"
nd handsome movi
ng toward her as
 she entered th
e room. Prince V
asíli approache
"d first, and she"
 kissed the bol
d forehead that 
bent over her ha
nd and answered 
his question by 
"
saying that, on"
" the contrary, s"
he remembered hi
m quite well. Th
en Anatole came
 up to her. She 
still could not 
see him. She onl
y felt a soft h
and taking hers 
"firmly, and she "
touched with her
 lips a white f
"orehead, over wh"
ich was beautifu
l light-brown ha
ir smelling of p
omade. When she
 looked up at hi
m she was struck
 by his beauty. 
Anatole stood w
ith his right th
umb under a butt
on of his unifor
"m, his chest exp"
anded and his b
"ack drawn in, sl"
ightly swinging 
"one foot, and, w"
ith his head a 
"little bent, loo"
ked with beaming
 face at the pri
ncess without s
peaking and evid
ently not thinki
ng about her at 
all. Anatole was
 not quick-witt
"ed, nor ready or"
 eloquent in con
"versation, but h"
e had the facul
"ty, so invaluabl"
"e in society, of"
 composure and i
mperturbable se
lf-possession. I
f a man lacking 
in self-confiden
ce remains dumb 
on a first intr
oduction and bet
rays a conscious
ness of the impr
opriety of such
 silence and an 
anxiety to find 
something to say
", the effect is"
 bad. But Anatol
"e was dumb, swun"
"g his foot, and "
smilingly examin
ed the princess
’ hair. It was
 evident that he
 could be silent
 in this way for
 a very long ti
me. “If anyone
 finds this sile
nce inconvenient
", let him
talk,"
 but I don’t w
"ant to,” he se"
emed to say. Bes
"ides this, in hi"
s behavior to w
omen Anatole had
 a manner which 
particularly ins
pires in them c
"uriosity, awe, a"
nd even love—a
 supercilious co
nsciousness of 
his own superior
ity. It was as i
f he said to the
m: “I know you
", I know
you, b"
ut why should I 
bother about you
? You’d be onl
"y too glad, of
"
course.” Perha
ps he did not re
ally think this 
when he met wome
n—even probab
"ly he did not, f"
or in general he
 thought very li
ttle—but his 
looks and manner
 gave that impre
ssion. The princ
"ess felt this, a"
nd as if wishin
g to show him th
at she did not e
ven dare expect 
"to interest him,"
 she turned to 
his father. The 
conversation was
 general and ani
"mated,
thanks t"
o Princess Lise�
��s voice and li
ttle downy lip t
hat lifted over 
 her white teeth
. She met Prince
 Vasíli with th
at playful manne
r often employe
d by lively chat
"ty people, and c"
onsisting in the
 assumption tha
t between the pe
rson they so add
ress and themsel
ves there are so
me semi-private
", long-establish"
ed jokes and amu
sing reminiscenc
"es, though
no s"
uch reminiscence
s really exist�
�just as none ex
isted in this ca
se. Prince Vas�
�li readily adop
ted her tone and
 the little prin
cess also drew 
"Anatole, whom sh"
"e hardly knew, i"
nto these amusin
g recollections 
of things that 
had never occurr
ed. Mademoiselle
 Bourienne also 
shared them and
 even Princess M
ary felt herself
 pleasantly made
 to share in the
se merry remini
scences.  “H
ere at least we 
shall have the b
enefit of your c
ompany all to o
"urselves, dear p"
"rince,” said t"
he little prince
"ss (of course, i"
n French) to Pr
ince Vasíli. �
�It’s not as a
t Annette’s * 
receptions wher
e you always ran
 away; you remem
ber cette chère
 Annette!”  
    * Anna Pávl
"ovna.

“Ah, "
but you won’t 
talk politics to
 me like Annette
!”  “And o
ur little tea ta
ble?”  “Oh
", yes!”

“"
Why is it you we
re never at Anne
tte’s?” the 
little princess 
asked Anatole. 
"“Ah, I know, I"
" know,” she sa"
id with a sly gl
"ance, “your
b"
rother Hippolyte
 told me about y
our goings on. O
h!” and she sh
ook her finger 
"at him, “I hav"
e even heard of 
your doings in P
aris!”  “A
nd didn’t Hipp
olyte tell you?�
�� asked Prince 
"Vasíli, turning"
 to his son and
 seizing the lit
tle princess’ 
arm as if she wo
uld have run aw
ay and he had ju
st managed to ca
"tch her, “didn"
’t he tell you
 how he himself
 was pining for 
the dear princes
"s, and how she s"
howed him the d
"oor? Oh, she is "
a pearl among wo
"men, Princess,�"
"� he added, turn"
ing to Princess
 Mary.  When P
aris was mention
"ed, Mademoiselle"
 Bourienne for h
er part seized t
he opportunity 
of joining in th
e general curren
t of recollectio
ns.  She took 
the liberty of i
nquiring whether
 it was long sin
ce Anatole had 
left Paris and h
ow he had liked 
that city. Anato
le answered the 
 Frenchwoman ver
"y readily and, l"
ooking at her wi
"th a smile, talk"
ed to her about
 her native land
. When he saw th
e pretty little 
"Bourienne, Anato"
le came to the 
conclusion that 
he would not fin

" he thought, exa"
"mining her, “n"

when we’re ma

� *      * The
 little one is c
harming.  The 
old prince dress
ed leisurely in 
"his study, frown"
ing and consider
ing what he was
 to do. The comi
ng of these visi
tors annoyed him
. “What are P
rince Vasíli an
d that son of hi
s to me? Prince 
Vasíli is a sha
llow braggart a
"nd his son, no d"
"oubt, is a fine "
"specimen,” he "
grumbled to him
self. What anger
ed him was that 
the coming of th
ese visitors rev
ived in his min
d an unsettled q
uestion he alway
s tried to stifl
"e, one about
wh"
ich he always de
ceived himself. 
The question was
 whether he coul
d ever bring hi
mself to part fr
om his daughter 
and give her to 
a husband. The 
prince never dir
ectly asked hims
elf that questio
"n, knowing befor"
ehand that he w
ould have to ans
"wer it justly, a"
nd justice clash
ed not only wit
h his feelings b
ut with the very
 possibility of 
life. Life witho
ut Princess Mar
"y, little as he "
seemed to value 
"her, was unthink"
able to him. �
�And why should 
she marry?” he
 thought. “To 
be unhappy for 
certain. There�
"�s Lise, married"
 to Andrew—a b
etter husband on
e would think c
ould hardly be f
ound nowadays—
but is she conte
nted with her l
ot? And who woul
d marry Marie fo
r love? Plain an
d awkward! They�
��ll take her f
or her connectio
ns and wealth. A
re there no wome
n living unmarr
"ied, and even th"
e happier for it
?” So thought 
Prince Bolkónsk
i while dressin
"g, and yet the q"
uestion he was a
lways putting of
f demanded an i
mmediate answer.
 Prince Vasíli 
had brought his 
son with the evi
dent intention 
"of proposing, an"
d today or tomor
row he would pro
bably ask for a
n answer. His bi
rth and position
 in society were
 not bad. “Wel
"l,
I’ve nothi"
"ng against it,�"
� the prince sai
"d to himself, �"
�but he must be
 worthy of her. 
And that is what
 we shall see.�
�  “That is 
what we shall se
e! That is what 
we shall see!”
 he added aloud
.  He entered 
the drawing room
 with his usual 
"alert step, glan"

 He noticed the

"thought, looking"
 irritably at he

  He went strai

Well! How d’ye

��Fine young fel

Anatole kissed t
"he old man, and "
looked at him wi
th curiosity and
 perfect compos

 a display of th
e eccentricities
 his father had 
 told him to exp

olkónski sat do

place in the cor

"
and, drawing up"
 an armchair for
" Prince Vasíli,"
 pointed to it a
nd began questi
oning him about

s and news. He s
eemed to listen 
 attentively to 
what Prince Vas�
"�li said, but ke"
pt glancing at P
rincess Mary. 
 “And so they
 are writing fro

��Is it for visi

said he. “Fin

��You must do as

he need not make

" sat down again,"

“Now you,"

”  “Now th

ide the old prin

“Well, "

scrutinizing Ana

 intently.  �
"�No, I have been"
 transferred to 
"the line,” sai"
"d Anatole, hardl"
y able to restr

.  “Ah! That
’s a good thin

 It is wartime. 
Such a fine fell

"Well, are you of"

"��

“No, Pri"

 Prince Bolkóns

laughed still lo
uder. Suddenly 
Prince Bolkónsk
i frowned.  �
"�You may go,” "
he said to Anato
le.  Anatole r
eturned smiling 
to the ladies. 
 “And so you�
��ve had him edu
"cated abroad, Pr"
"ince Vasíli, ha"
ven’t you?”
 said the old pr
ince to Prince V
asíli.  “I 
have done my bes

 can assure you 
the education th

"�

“Yes, eve"
rything is diffe

verything is cha
nged. The lad�

", a fine fellow!"
" Well, come with"
 me now.” He t
ook Prince Vas�

led him to his s
tudy. As soon as
 they were alon
"e together, Prin"
ce Vasíli annou
nced his hopes a
nd wishes to the
 old prince.  
"
“Well, do you"
 think I shall p
"revent her, that"
 I can’t part 
from her?” sa
id the old princ
e angrily. “Wh
at an idea! I’
m ready for it 
tomorrow! Only l
"et me tell you, "
I want to know m
y son-in-law bet
ter. You know m
y principles—e
verything aboveb
oard! I will ask
 her tomorrow in
 your presence;
 if she is willi
"ng, then he can "
stay on. He can 
stay and I’ll
 see.” The old
 prince snorted.
 “Let her marr
"y, it’s all th"
e same to me!�
� he screamed in
 the same pierci
ng tone as when 
parting from hi
s son.  “I w
ill tell you fra
"nkly,” said Pr"
ince Vasíli in 
the tone of a c
rafty man convin
ced of the futil
ity of being cun
ning with so ke
en-sighted a com
panion. “You k
"now, you see rig"
ht through peopl
e. Anatole is n
"o genius, but he"
" is an honest, g"
oodhearted lad; 
an excellent so
n or kinsman.”
  “All right
", all right, we�"
��ll see!”  
As always happen
s when women lea
d lonely lives f
or any length of
 time without m
"ale society, on "
Anatole’s appe
arance all the t
hree women of P
rince Bolkónski
’s household f
elt that their l
ife had not been
 real till then
. Their powers o
"f reasoning, fee"
"ling, and observ"
ing immediately 
 increased tenfo
"ld, and their li"
"fe, which seemed"
 to have been pa
ssed in darknes
"s, was suddenly "
lit up by a new 
"brightness, full"
 of significance
.  Princess Ma
ry grew quite un
conscious of her
 face and coiffu
re. The handsom
e open face of t
he man who might
 perhaps be her 
husband absorbed
 all her attent
ion. He seemed t
"o her kind, brav"
"e, determined, m"
"anly, and
magna"
nimous. She felt
 convinced of th
at. Thousands of
 dreams of a fut
ure family life
 continually ros
e in her imagina
tion. She drove 
them away and t
ried to conceal 
them.  “But 
am I not too col
d with him?” t
hought the princ
ess. “I try t
o be reserved be
cause in the dep
th of my soul I 
feel too near to
" him
already, b"
ut then he canno
t know what I th
ink of him and m
ay imagine that

im.”  And Pr
incess Mary trie
"d, but could not"
" manage, to be c"
ordial to her ne
w guest. “Poo
"r girl, she’s "
devilish ugly!�
� thought Anatol
e.  Mademoisel
"le Bourienne, al"
so roused to gre
at excitement by
 Anatole’s ar
"rival, thought i"
n another way. O
"f course, she, a"
 handsome young 
woman without a
ny definite posi
"tion, without re"
lations or even 
"a country, did
"
not intend to de
vote her life to
 serving Prince 
"Bolkónski, to r"
eading aloud to
 him and being f
riends with Prin
cess Mary. Madem
oiselle Bourien
ne had long been
 waiting for a R
ussian prince wh
"o, able to
appr"
eciate at a glan
ce her superiori
"ty to the plain,"
" badly dressed,"
 ungainly Russia
"n princesses, wo"
uld fall in love
 with her and ca
rry her off; an
d here at last w
as a Russian pri
nce. Mademoisell
e Bourienne knew
"
a story, heard"
 from her aunt b
ut finished in h
"er own way, whic"
h she liked to 
repeat to hersel
f. It was the st
ory of a girl wh
o had been sedu
"ced, and to whom"
 her poor mother
 (sa pauvre mèr
"e) appeared, and"
 reproached her
 for yielding to
 a man without b
eing married. Ma
demoiselle Bour
ienne was often 
touched to tears
 as in imaginati
on she told this
"
story to him, "
her seducer. And
" now he, a real "
"Russian prince, "
had appeared. H
e would carry he
r away and then 
sa pauvre mère 
would appear an
d he would marry
 her. So her fut
ure shaped itsel
f in Mademoisell
e Bourienne’s
 head at the ver
y time she was t
alking to Anatol
e about Paris. 
It was not calcu
lation that guid
ed her (she did 
not even for a 
moment consider 
what she should 
"do), but all thi"
s had long been 
familiar to her
", and now that A"
natole had appea
red it just grou
ped itself aroun
d him and she w
ished and tried 
to please him as
 much as possibl
e.  The little
" princess, like "
an old war horse
 that hears the 
"trumpet,
uncons"
ciously and quit
e forgetting her
" condition, prep"
ared for the fa
miliar gallop of
" coquetry, witho"
ut any ulterior 
motive or any s
"truggle, but wit"
h naïve and lig
hthearted gaiety
.  Although in
 female society 
Anatole usually 
assumed the role
 of a man tired
 of being run af
"ter by women, hi"
s vanity was fla
ttered by the s
pectacle of his 
power over these
 three women. Be
"sides that, he w"
as beginning to
 feel for the pr
etty and provoca
tive Mademoisell
e Bourienne tha
t passionate ani
mal feeling whic
h was apt to mas
ter him with gre
at suddenness a
nd prompt him to
 the coarsest an
d most reckless 
actions.  Afte
"r tea, the compa"
ny went into the
 sitting room an
d Princess Mary 
was asked to pl
ay on the clavic
"hord. Anatole, l"
aughing and in h
"igh spirits,
ca"
me and leaned on
" his elbows, fac"
ing her and besi
de Mademoiselle 
 Bourienne. Prin
cess Mary felt h
is look with a p
ainfully joyous 
emotion. Her fa
vorite sonata bo
re her into a mo
st intimately po
etic world and 
the look she fel
t upon her made 
that world still
 more poetic. Bu
t Anatole’s e
"xpression, thoug"
h his eyes were 
"fixed on her, re"
ferred not to h
er but to the mo
vements of Madem
oiselle Bourienn
e’s little fo
"ot, which he was"
 then touching w
ith his own unde
r the clavichord
. Mademoiselle 
Bourienne was al
so looking at Pr
"incess Mary, and"
 in her lovely 
eyes there was a
 look of fearful
 joy and hope th
at was also new 
 to the princess
.  “How she 
loves me!” tho
ught Princess Ma
ry. “How happy
" I am now,
and "
how happy I may 
be with such a f
riend and such a
 husband! Husban
d? Can it be po
ssible?” she t
"hought, not dari"
ng to look at hi
"s face, but
sti"
ll feeling his e
yes gazing at he
r.  In the eve
"ning, after supp"
"er, when all wer"
e about to retir
"e, Anatole
kiss"
ed Princess Mary
’s hand. She d
id not know how 
she found the c
"ourage, but she "
looked straight 
into his handsom
e face as it cam
e near to her s
hortsighted eyes
. Turning from P
rincess Mary he 
went up and kis
sed Mademoiselle
 Bourienne’s h
and. (This was n
"ot etiquette, bu"
t then he did e
verything so sim
ply and with suc
h assurance!) Ma
demoiselle Bour
"ienne flushed, a"
nd gave the prin
cess a frightene
d look.  “Wh
at delicacy!” 
thought the prin
cess. “Is it p
ossible that Am
élie” (Mademo
iselle Bourienne
) “thinks I co
uld be jealous o
"f her,
and not "
value her pure a
ffection and dev
otion to me?” 
She went up to 
her and kissed h
er warmly. Anato
le went up to ki
ss the little p
rincess’ hand.
  “No! No! N
o! When your fat
her writes to te
ll me that you a
re behaving wel
l I will give yo
u my hand to kis
s. Not till then
!” she said. A
nd smilingly ra
ising a finger a
"t him, she left "
the room.    
   CHAPTER V 
 They all separ
"ated, but, excep"
t Anatole who fe
ll asleep as soo
n as he got int
"o bed, all kept "
awake a long tim
e that night.  
 “Is he really
 to be my husban
"d, this stranger"
 who is so kind�
"��yes,
kind, th"
at is the chief 
"thing,” though"
t Princess Mary;
" and fear, which"
 she had seldom
" experienced, ca"
me upon her. She
 feared to look 
"round, it
seeme"
d to her that so
meone was there 
standing behind 
the screen in th
e dark corner. 
And this someone
 was he—the de
vil—and he was
 also this man 
with the white f
"orehead, black e"
"yebrows, and red"
 lips.  She ra
ng for her maid 
and asked her to
 sleep in her ro
om.  Mademoise
lle Bourienne wa
lked up and down
 the conservator
y for a long ti
"me that evening,"
 vainly expectin
"g someone, now s"
miling at someon
"e, now
working "
herself up to te
ars with the ima
ginary words of 
her pauvre mère
 rebuking her f
or her fall.  
The little princ
ess grumbled to 
her maid that he
r bed was badly 
made. She could
 not lie either 
on her face or o
n her side. Ever
y position was 
awkward and unco
"mfortable, and h"
er burden oppres
sed her now more
 than ever beca
use Anatole’s 
presence had viv
idly recalled to
 her the time w
hen she was not 
like that and wh
en everything wa
s light and gay.
 She sat in an 
armchair in her 
dressing jacket 
and nightcap and
" Katie, sleepy
"
"and disheveled, "
beat and turned 
the heavy feathe
r bed for the th
"ird
time, mutte"
ring to herself.
  “I told yo
u it was all lum
ps and holes!”
 the little prin
cess repeated. 
“I should be g
lad enough to fa
"ll asleep, so it"
’s not my fau
lt!” and her v
oice quivered li
ke that of a chi
ld about to cry.
  The old prin
ce did not sleep
 either. Tíkhon
", half asleep, h"
eard him pacing
 angrily about a
nd snorting. The
 old prince felt
 as though he h
ad been insulted
 through his dau
ghter. The insul
t was the more p
ointed because 
it concerned not
 himself but ano
"ther, his daught"
"er, whom he
lov"
ed more than him
self. He kept te
lling himself th
at he would cons
ider the whole 
matter and decid
e what was right
 and how he shou
"ld act, but
ins"
tead of that he 
only excited him
self more and mo
re.  “The fi
rst man that tur
ns up—she forg
ets her father a
nd everything e
"lse, runs upstai"
rs and does up h
er hair and wags
 her tail and is
 unlike herself
! Glad to throw 
her father over!
 And she knew I 
should notice i
t. Fr... fr... f
r! And don’t I
 see that that i
diot had eyes on
ly for Bourienn
e—I shall have
 to get rid of h
er. And how is i
t she has not p
ride enough to s
ee it? If she ha
s no pride for h
erself she might
 at least have 
some for my sake
! She must be sh
own that the blo
ckhead thinks n
othing of her an
d looks only at 
"Bourienne. No, s"
he has no pride.
.. but I’ll l
et her see....�
�  The old pri
nce knew that if
 he told his dau
ghter she was ma
king a mistake 
and that Anatole
 meant to flirt 
with Mademoisell
"e Bourienne,
Pr"
incess Mary’s 
self-esteem woul
d be wounded and
 his point (not 
to be parted fr
om her) would be
" gained, so paci"
fying himself wi
th this thought
", he called Tík"
hon and began to
 undress.  “
What devil broug
ht them here?”
" thought he, whi"
le Tíkhon was 
putting the nigh
tshirt over his 
dried-up old bod
y and gray-haire
d chest. “I n
ever invited the
m. They came to 
disturb my life�
��and there is n
ot much of it l
eft.”  “De
vil take ‘em!�
"�� he muttered, "
while his head w
as still covered
 by the shirt. 
  Tíkhon knew 
his master’s h
abit of sometime
s thinking aloud
", and
therefore"
 met with unalte
red looks the an
grily inquisitiv
e expression of 
 the face that e
merged from the 
shirt.  “Gon
e to bed?” ask
ed the prince. 
"
Tíkhon, like "
"all good valets,"
 instinctively k
new the directio
n of his master
’s thoughts. H
e guessed that t
he question refe
rred to Prince 
Vasíli and his 
son.  “They 
have gone to bed
 and put out the
"ir lights, your "
excellency.” 
 “No good... 
no good...” sa
id the prince ra
"pidly, and thrus"
ting his feet i
nto his slippers
 and his arms in
to the sleeves o
f his dressing 
"gown, he went to"
 the couch on wh
ich he slept.  
 Though no words
 had passed betw
een Anatole and 
Mademoiselle Bou
"rienne,
they qu"
ite understood o
ne another as to
 the first part 
of their romance
",
up to the app"
earance of the p
auvre mère; the
y understood tha
t they had much
 to say to one a
nother in privat
e and so they ha
d been seeking a
n opportunity s
ince morning to 
meet one another
 alone. When Pri
ncess Mary went
 to her father�
�s room at the u
"sual hour, Madem"
oiselle Bourienn
e and Anatole m
et in the conser
vatory.  Princ
ess Mary went to
 the door of the
 study with spec
ial trepidation.
 It seemed to h
er that not only
 did everybody k
now that her fat
e would be deci
"ded that day, bu"
t that they also
 knew what she t
hought about it.
 She read this 
in Tíkhon’s f
ace and in that 
of Prince Vasíl
"i’s valet,
wh"
o made her a low
 bow when she me
t him in the cor
ridor carrying h
ot water.  Th
e old prince was
 very affectiona
te and careful i
n his treatment 
of his daughter
 that morning. P
rincess Mary wel
l knew this pain
staking express
ion of her fathe
r’s. His face 
wore that expres
sion when his d
ry hands clenche
d with vexation 
at her not under
standing a sum i
"n
arithmetic, w"
hen rising from 
his chair he wou
ld walk away fro
"m her,
repeatin"
g in a low voice
 the same words 
several times ov
er.  He came t
o the point at o
"nce, treating he"
r ceremoniously.
  “I have ha
d a proposition 
made me concerni
"ng you,” he sa"
id with an unna
tural smile. “
I expect you hav
e guessed that P
rince Vasíli ha
s not come and 
brought his pupi
l with him” (f
or some reason P
rince Bolkónsk
i referred to An
atole as a “pu
pil”) “for t
he sake of my b
eautiful eyes. L
ast night a prop
osition was made
 me on your acco
"unt
and, as you"
 know my princip
"les, I refer it "
to you.”  �
�How am I to und
"erstand you, mon"
 père?” said 
"the princess, gr"
owing pale and 
then blushing. 
 “How underst
and me!” cried
 her father angr
ily. “Prince V
asíli finds yo
u to his taste a
s a daughter-in-
law and makes a 
proposal to you 
 on his pupil’
s behalf. That�
�s how it’s to
 be understood! 
‘How understa

 I ask you!” 
 “I do not kn

ispered the prin
cess.  “I? I
? What of me? Le
ave me out of th
e question. I’
m not going to 
get married. Wha
t about you? Tha
t’s what I wan
t to know.”  
 The princess sa
w that her fathe
r regarded the m
atter with disap
"proval,
but at "
that moment the 
thought occurred
 to her that her
 fate would be 
decided now or n

d her eyes so as
 not to see the 
gaze under whic
h she felt that 
she could not th
"ink, but would o"
nly be able to 
submit from habi
"t, and she said:"
 “I wish only 
"to do your will,"
 but if I had t
o express my own
 desire...” Sh
e had no time to
 finish. The old
 prince interru
pted her.  “
That’s admirab
le!” he shoute
d. “He will ta
ke you with your
 dowry and take
 Mademoiselle Bo
urienne into the
 bargain. She’
"ll be the
wife,"
 while you...”
  The prince s
topped. He saw t
he effect these 
words had produc
ed on his daugh
ter. She lowered
 her head and wa
s ready to burst
 into tears.  
"“Now then, now"
" then, I’m onl"
y joking!” he 
said. “Remembe
"r this,
Princes"
"s, I hold to the"
 principle that 
a maiden has a f

 he still shoute
d when the prin

" in a fog, had a"
lready staggered
 out of the stu

was decided and 
happily decided.
 But what her fa
ther had said a
bout Mademoisell
e Bourienne was 
dreadful. It was
 untrue to be su
"re, but
still i"
"t was terrible, "
and she could no
t help thinking 
of it. She was 
going straight o
n through the co
"nservatory, neit"
her seeing nor h
earing anything
", when suddenly "
the well-known w
hispering of Mad
emoiselle Bouri

. She raised her
" eyes, and two s"
teps away saw A
natole embracing
 the Frenchwoman
 and whispering 
something to her
. With a horrif

n his handsome f
"ace, Anatole loo"
ked at Princess 
"
Mary, but did n"
ot at once take 
his arm from the
 waist of Mademo

e who had not ye
t seen her.  �
��Who’s that? 
Why? Wait a mome

�s face seemed t
o say. Princess
 Mary looked at 
them in silence.
 She could not u
nderstand it. At
 last Mademoise
lle Bourienne ga
ve a scream and 
ran away. Anatol
e bowed to Prin
cess Mary with a
" gay smile, as i"
f inviting her t
o join in a laug

 then shrugging 
his shoulders we
nt to the door 
that led to his 
own apartments. 
  An hour later
", Tíkhon came t"

Mary to the old 
prince; he adde
d that Prince Va

Princess Mary wa

“No, "

 “Why? I love

      CHAP
TER VI  It was
 long since the 
Rostóvs had new
s of Nicholas. N
ot till midwinte
r was the count
 at last handed 
a letter address
ed in his son’
s handwriting. 
"On receiving it,"
 he ran on tipto
e to his study i
n alarm and has
"te, trying to es"
"cape notice, clo"
"sed the door, an"
d began to read 
the letter.  
Anna Mikháylovn
"a, who always kn"
ew everything th
at passed in the
" house,
on hear"
ing of the arriv
al of the letter
 went softly int
o the room and 
found the count 
with it in his h
"and, sobbing and"
 laughing at the
 same time.  
Anna Mikháylovn
"a, though her ci"
rcumstances had 
"improved, was st"
ill living with
 the Rostóvs. 
 “My dear fri
end?” said she
", in a tone of p"
"athetic inquiry,"
 prepared to sy
mpathize in any 
way.  The coun
t sobbed yet mor
e.  “Nikóle
nka... a letter.
.. wa... a... s.
.. wounded... my
 darling boy...
 the countess...
 promoted to be 
an officer... th
ank God... How 
tell the little 
countess!”  
Anna Mikháylovn
a sat down besid
"e him, with her "
own handkerchief
 wiped the tear
s from his eyes 
and from the let
"ter, then having"
 dried her own 
eyes she comfort
"ed the count, an"
d decided that a
t dinner and til
l teatime she w
ould prepare the
" countess, and a"
"fter tea, with G"
"od’s
help, wo"
uld inform her. 
  At dinner Ann
a Mikháylovna t
alked the whole 
time about the w
ar news and abo
"ut Nikólenka, t"
wice asked when 
the last letter 
had been receive
"d
from him, tho"
ugh she knew tha
"t already, and r"
emarked that the
y might very li
kely be getting 
a letter from hi
m that day. Each
 time that these
 hints began to
 make the counte
ss anxious and s
he glanced uneas
ily at the coun
t and at Anna Mi
"kháylovna, the "
latter very adro
itly turned the
 conversation to
 insignificant m
atters. Natásha
", who, of the wh"
"ole
family, was"
 the most gifted
 with a capacity
 to feel any sha
des of intonati
"on, look, and ex"
"pression, pricke"
d up her ears fr
om the beginning
 of the meal an
d was certain th
at there was som
e secret between
 her father and
 Anna Mikháylov
"na, that it had "
something to do 
with her brothe
"r, and that Anna"
 Mikháylovna wa
s preparing them
 for it. Bold as
"
she was, Natá"
"sha, who knew ho"
w sensitive her 
mother was to an
ything relating
" to Nikólenka, "
did not venture 
to ask any quest
"ions at dinner,"
 but she was too
 excited to eat 
anything and kep
t wriggling abou
t on her chair 
regardless of he
r governess’ r
emarks. After di
"nner, she rushed"
 headlong after
 Anna Mikháylov
"na and, dashing "
"at her, flung he"
rself on her ne
ck as soon as sh
e overtook her i
n the sitting ro
om.  “Auntie
", darling, do te"
ll me what it is
!”  “Nothi
"ng, my dear.”"
"

“No, deares"
"t, sweet one, ho"
"ney, I won’t g"
ive up—I know 
you know someth
ing.”  Anna 
Mikháylovna sho
ok her head.  
“You are a lit
"tle slyboots,”"
 she said.  �
�A letter from N
ikólenka! I’m
 sure of it!” 
exclaimed Natás
"ha,
reading con"
firmation in Ann
a Mikháylovna�
�s face.  “B
ut for God’s s
"ake, be careful,"
 you know how it
 may affect your
 mamma.”  �
"��I will, I will"
", only tell me! "
You won’t? The
n I will go and 
tell at once.�
�  Anna Mikhá
"ylovna, in a few"
" words, told her"
 the contents of
" the letter,
on"
 condition that 
she should tell 
no one.  “No
", on my true wor"
"d of honor,” s"
"aid Natásha, cr"
"ossing herself,"
 “I won’t te
ll anyone!” an
d she ran off at
 once to Sónya.
  “Nikólenk
a... wounded... 
"a letter,” she"
 announced in gl
eeful triumph. 
  “Nicholas!�
�� was all Sóny
"a said, instantl"
y turning white.
"

Natásha, se"
eing the impress
ion the news of 
her brother’s 
wound produced 
"on Sónya, felt "
for the first ti
me the sorrowful
 side of the ne
ws.  She rushe
"d to Sónya, hug"
"ged her, and beg"
an to cry.  �
"�A little wound,"
 but he has been
 made an officer
; he is well now
", he
wrote hims"
"elf,” said she"
 through her tea
rs.  “There 
now! It’s true
 that all you wo
men are crybabie
"s,” remarked
"
"Pétya, pacing t"
he room with lar
"ge, resolute str"
ides. “Now I�
"�m very
glad, v"
"ery glad indeed,"
 that my brother
 has distinguish
ed himself so. 
You are all blub
berers and under
stand nothing.�
�  Natásha sm
iled through her
 tears.  “Yo
u haven’t read
 the letter?” 
asked Sónya.  
"
“No, but she "
said that it was
 all over and th
at he’s now an
 officer.”  
 “Thank God!�
"� said Sónya, c"
rossing herself.
 “But perhaps 
she deceived yo
u. Let us go to 
Mamma.”  Pé
tya paced the ro
om in silence fo
r a time.  “
If I’d been in
 Nikólenka’s 
place I would ha
ve killed even m
ore of those Fr
"enchmen,” he s"
aid. “What nas
ty brutes they a
re! I’d have 
killed so many t
hat there’d ha

�Hold your tongu
"e, Pétya, what "
a goose you are!
”  “I’m 
"not a goose, but"
 they are who cr
"y about trifles,"
” said Pétya
.  “Do you r
emember him?” 
Natásha suddenl
"y asked, after a"
 moment’s sil
ence.  Sónya 
smiled.  “Do
 I remember Nich
olas?”  “N
"o, Sónya, but d"
o you remember s
o that you remem
ber him perfectl
"y,
remember eve"
rything?” said
" Natásha, with "
an expressive ge
"sture,
evidentl"
y wishing to giv
e her words a ve
ry definite mean
ing. “I remem
ber Nikólenka t
"oo, I remember h"
"im well,” she "
said. “But I 
don’t remember
 Borís. I don�
�t remember him 
a bit.”  “
What! You don’
t remember Borí
s?” asked Són
ya in surprise. 
  “It’s not
 that I don’t

w what he is lik
"e, but not

st shut my eyes 
"and remember,
b"
ut Borís... No!
” (She shut he
r eyes.) “No! 
there’s nothin
g at all.”  
"
“Oh, Natásha"
!” said Sónya
", looking ecstat"
ically and earne
stly at her fri
end as if she di
d not consider h
er worthy to hea
r what she meant
 to say and as 
if she were sayi
ng it to someone
" else, with whom"
 joking was out
 of the question
", “I am in lov"
e with your brot
her once for all
"
and, whatever "
may happen to hi
"m or to me, shal"
l never cease to
 love him as lo
ng as I live.”
  Natásha loo
ked at Sónya wi
th wondering and
 inquisitive eye
"s, and said
not"
hing. She felt t
hat Sónya was s
peaking the trut
"h, that there wa"
s such love as 
Sónya was speak
ing of. But Nat�
�sha had not yet
 felt anything 
like it. She bel
ieved it could b
"e, but did not u"
nderstand it.  
 “Shall you wr
ite to him?” s
he asked.  Só
nya became thoug
htful. The quest
ion of how to wr
"ite to Nicholas,"
 and whether sh
e ought to write
", tormented her."
 Now that he was
 already an off
icer and a wound
"ed hero, would i"
t be right to re
mind him of hers
"elf
and, as it "
"might seem, of t"
he obligations t

  “I don’t

you won’t feel
 ashamed to writ

Sónya smiled. 
 “No.”  �
��And I should b

�  “And I kn
ow why she’d b

"id Pétya, offen"
ded by Natásha
’s previous re
mark. “It’s

 On retiring to

he sat in an arm

Anna Mikháylovn

proud expression
 of a surgeon w

admits the publ

��It is done!”
 she said to the
" count, pointing"
 triumphantly to
" the
countess, "
who sat holding 
in one hand the 
snuffbox with it
s portrait and 
in the other the
" letter, and pre"
ssing them alter
nately to her li

"saw the count, s"
he stretched out
 her arms to him
", embraced his
"
"bald head, over "
which she again 
looked at the le
tter and the por
"trait,
and in o"
rder to press th
em again to her 
"lips, she slight"
ly pushed away 
the bald head. V
"éra, Natásha, "
"Sónya, and Pét"
ya now entered t

and th"
e reading of the

fter a brief des
cription of the
 campaign and th
e two battles in
 which he had ta
"ken part, and hi"
"s
promotion, Ni"
cholas said that
 he kissed his f
ather’s and mo

"des that, he sen"

"g, Madame
Schos"
"s, and his old n"

them to kiss for
 him “dear S�
"�nya, whom he lo"
ved and thought 
of just the same
 as ever.” Whe
n she heard thi
s Sónya blushed
 so that tears c
ame into her eye
"s and, unable
t"
o bear the looks
 turned upon her
", ran away into "
the dancing hall
",
whirled round"
 it at full spee
d with her dress
 puffed out like
" a balloon,
and"
", flushed and sm"
"iling, plumped d"
own on the floor
. The countess w
as crying.  �
��Why are you cr
"ying, Mamma?” "
asked Véra. “
From all he says
 one should be 
glad and not cry
.”  This was
" quite true, but"
" the count, the "
"countess, and Na"
tásha looked a
t her reproachfu
lly. “And who 
is it she takes 
after?” though
t the countess.
  Nicholas’ 
letter was read 
over hundreds of
" times, and thos"
e who were cons
idered worthy to
 hear it had to 
come to the coun
"tess, for she
d"
id not let it ou
t of her hands. 
"The tutors came,"
" and the nurses,"
" and
Dmítri, a"
nd several acqua
"intances, and th"
e countess rerea
d the letter ea
ch time with fre
sh pleasure and 
each time discov
ered in it fresh
 proofs of Nik�
�lenka’s virtu
"es. How strange,"
 how extraordina
"ry, how
joyful "
"it seemed, that "
"her son, the sca"
rcely perceptibl
e motion of whos
e tiny limbs sh
e had felt twent
y years ago with
"in her, that son"
 about whom she
 used to have qu
arrels with the 
too indulgent co
"unt, that son wh"
o had first lea
rned to say “p
ear” and then 
"“granny,” th"
at this son sho
uld now be away 
in a foreign lan
d amid strange s
"urroundings, a m"
anly warrior do
ing some kind of
 man’s work of
" his own, withou"
t help or guida
nce. The univers
al experience of
" ages, showing t"
hat children do 
 grow impercepti
bly from the cra
"dle to manhood, "
did not exist fo
r the countess.
 Her son’s gro
wth toward manho
"od, at each of i"
"ts stages,
had "
seemed as extrao
rdinary to her a
s if there had n
ever existed the
 millions of hu
man beings who g
rew up in the sa
me way. As twent
"y
years before,"
 it seemed impos
sible that the l
ittle creature w
ho lived somewh
ere under her he
art would ever c
"ry, suck her bre"
"ast, and begin t"
"o
speak, so now"
 she could not b
elieve that that
 little creature
 could be this 
"strong, brave ma"
"n, this model so"
n and officer th
"at, judging by t"
"his
letter, he "
now was.  “W
hat a style! How
 charmingly he d
escribes!” sai
"d she, reading t"
he descriptive 
part of the lett
er. “And what 
a soul! Not a wo
rd about himsel
f.... Not a word
! About some Den
"ísov or other, "
though he himsel
"f,
I dare say, "
is braver than a
ny of them. He s
ays nothing abou
t his suffering
s. What a heart!
 How like him it
 is! And how he 
has remembered 
everybody! Not f
orgetting anyone
. I always said 
when he was only
 so high—I al
ways said....”
  For more tha
n a week prepara
tions were being
" made, rough dra"
fts of letters 
to Nicholas from
 all the househo
ld were written 
"and copied out,"
 while under the
 supervision of

     CHAPTE
R VII  On the 
twelfth of Novem
"ber, Kutúzov’"
"s active army, i"
n camp before O
"lmütz, was prep"
aring to be revi
ewed next day by
 the two Emperor
s—the Russian
 and the Austria
"n. The Guards, j"
ust arrived from
" Russia, spent
"
the night ten mi
les from Olmütz
 and next mornin
g were to come s
traight to the 
"review, reaching"
 the field at Ol
mütz by ten o�
�clock.  That 
day Nicholas Ros
tóv received a 
letter from Bor�
"�s, telling him"
 that the Ismáy
lov regiment was
 quartered for t
he night ten mil
es from Olmütz
 and that he wan
ted to see him a
s he had a lette
r and money for 
 him. Rostóv wa
s particularly i
n need of money 
now that the tro
"ops,
after thei"
r active service
", were stationed"
 near Olmütz an
d the camp swar
med with well-pr
ovisioned sutler
s and Austrian J
ews offering al
l sorts of tempt
ing wares. The P
ávlograds held 
feast after feas
"t,
celebrating "
awards they had 
received for the
" campaign, and m"
ade expeditions
 to Olmütz to v
isit a certain C
aroline the Hung
"arian,
who had "
recently opened 
a restaurant the
re with girls as
 waitresses. Ro
"stóv, who had j"
ust celebrated h
is promotion to 
a cornetcy and b
ought Denísov�
"��s horse, Bedou"
"in, was in debt "
"all round, to hi"
s comrades and 
the sutlers. On 
receiving Borís
’ letter he ro
de with a fellow
 officer to Olm
"ütz, dined ther"
"e, drank a bottl"
"e of wine, and t"
hen set off alon
e to the Guards
’ camp to find
 his old playmat
e. Rostóv had n
ot yet had time
 to get his unif
orm. He had on a
 shabby cadet ja
"cket, decorated "
with a soldier�
"��s cross, equal"
ly shabby cadet�
��s riding breec
hes lined with 
"worn leather, an"
d an officer’s
 saber with a sw
ord knot. The Do
n horse he was 
riding was one h
e had bought fro
m a Cossack duri
"ng the campaign,"
 and he wore a 
crumpled hussar 
cap stuck jaunti
ly back on one s
ide of his head
. As he rode up 
to the camp he t
hought how he wo
uld impress Bor�
�s and all his 
comrades of the 
Guards by his ap
pearance—that 
of a fighting h
ussar who had be
en under fire. 
 The Guards had
 made their whol
e march as if on
 a pleasure trip
", parading
thei"
r cleanliness an
d discipline. Th
ey had come by e
"asy stages, thei"
r knapsacks con
"veyed on carts, "
and the Austrian
 authorities had
 provided excel
lent dinners for
 the officers at
 every halting p
lace. The regime
nts had entered
 and left the to
wn with their ba
"nds playing, and"
 by the Grand D
uke’s orders t
he men had march
ed all the way i
n step (a practi
ce on which the
 Guards prided t
"hemselves), the "
officers on foot
 and at their p
roper posts. Bor
ís had been qua
"rtered, and had "
marched all the 
"
way, with Berg "
who was already 
in command of a 
"company. Berg, w"
ho had obtained
 his captaincy d
uring the campai
"gn, had gained t"
he confidence of
 his superiors 
by his promptitu
de and accuracy 
and had arranged
 his money matt
ers very satisfa
"ctorily. Borís,"
 during the camp
"aign, had made t"
he acquaintance
 of many persons
 who might prove
" useful to him, "
and by a letter
 of recommendati
on he had brough
t from Pierre ha
d become acquai
nted with Prince
 Andrew Bolkóns
"ki, through whom"
 he hoped to ob
tain a post on t
he commander in 
chief’s staff.
 Berg and Borís
",
having rested"
 after yesterday
"’s march, were"
" sitting, clean "
and neatly dres
"sed, at a round "
table in the cle
an quarters allo
"tted to them,
p"
laying chess. Be
rg held a smokin
g pipe between h
is knees. Borís
", in
the accura"
te way character
"istic of him, wa"
s building a lit
tle pyramid of 
chessmen with hi
s delicate white
 fingers while a
waiting Berg’s
" move,
and watc"
hed his opponent
"’s face, evide"
ntly thinking ab
out the game as 
 he always thoug
ht only of whate
ver he was engag
ed on.  “Wel
"l, how are you g"
oing to get out 
of that?” he r
emarked.  “W
"e’ll try to,�"
"� replied Berg, "
touching a pawn 
and then removin
g his hand.  
At that moment t
he door opened. 
  “Here he is
 at last!” sho
uted Rostóv. �
�And Berg too! O
"h, you
petisenf"
"ans, allay cusha"
y dormir!” he 
"exclaimed, imita"
ting his Russian
 nurse’s Fren
"ch, at which he "
and Borís used 
to laugh long ag
o.  “Dear me
", how you have c"
hanged!”  Bo
rís rose to mee
"t Rostóv, but i"
n doing so did n
ot omit to stead
y and replace s
ome chessmen tha
t were falling. 
He was about to 
embrace his fri
"end, but Nichola"
s avoided him. W
ith that peculia
r feeling of you
"th,
that dread "
of beaten tracks
", and wish to ex"
press itself in 
a manner differ
ent from that of
 its elders whic
h is often insin
"cere, Nicholas
"
wished to do som
ething special o
n meeting his fr
iend. He wanted 
"to pinch
him, p"
"ush him, do anyt"
hing but kiss hi
m—a thing ever
ybody did. But 
notwithstanding 
"this, Borís emb"
raced him in a q
"uiet, friendly w"
ay and kissed h
im three times. 
  They had not 
met for nearly h
"alf a year and, "
being at the age
 when young men
 take their firs
t steps on life�
"��s road, each s"
aw immense chang
es in the other
", quite a new re"
flection of the 
society in which
 they had taken 
 those first ste
ps. Both had cha
nged greatly sin
ce they last met
 and both were 
in a hurry to sh
ow the changes t
hat had taken pl
ace in them.  
"“Oh, you damne"
d dandies! Clean
 and fresh as if
 you’d been to
" a fete,
not li"
ke us sinners of
" the line,” cr"
"ied Rostóv, wit"
h martial swagge
r and with bari
tone notes in hi
"s voice, new to "
"Borís, pointing"
 to his own mud
-bespattered bre
eches. The Germa
"n landlady, hear"
ing Rostóv’s 
"loud
voice, pop"
ped her head in 
at the door.  
"“Eh, is she pr"
etty?” he aske
d with a wink. 
 “Why do you 
shout so? You’
ll frighten them
!” said Borís
. “I did not 
expect you today
",” he added. �"
��I only sent yo
u the note yeste
rday by Bolkón
ski—an adjutan
t of Kutúzov’
"s, who’s a fri"
end of mine. I 
did not think he
 would get it to
 you so quickly.
"... Well, how ar"
e you? Been und
er fire already?
” asked Borís
.  Without ans
"wering, Rostóv "
shook the soldie
r’s Cross of S
t. George faste
ned to the cordi
ng of his unifor
"m and, indicatin"
g a bandaged arm
",
glanced at Be"
rg with a smile.
  “As you se
"e,” he said.
"
 “Indeed? Yes
", yes!” said B"
"orís, with a sm"
ile. “And we t
oo have had a s
plendid march. Y
"ou know, of cour"
"se, that His Imp"
erial Highness 
rode with our re
giment all the t
"ime, so that we "
had every comfor

antage. What rec
eptions we had i
n Poland! What d
inners and ball
s! I can’t tel
l you. And the T
sarévich was ve
ry gracious to a
ll our officers
.”  And the 
two friends told
 each other of t
"heir doings, the"
 one of his hus
sar revels and l
ife in the fight
"ing line, the ot"
her of the pleas
ures and advant
ages of service 
under members of
 the Imperial fa
"mily.

“Oh, "
you Guards!” s
aid Rostóv. “
"I say, send for "
some wine.”  
 Borís made a g
rimace.  “If
 you really want
" it,” said he."
  He went to h
"is bed, drew a p"
urse from under 
the clean pillow
", and sent
for "
"wine.

“Yes,"
 and I have some
 money and a let
"ter to give you,"
” he added.  
 Rostóv took th
"e letter and, th"
rowing the money
" on the sofa, pu"
t both arms on 
the table and be
gan to read. Aft
er reading a few
" lines, he
glan"
ced angrily at B
"erg, then, meeti"
"ng his eyes, hid"
 his face behind
 the letter.  
"
“Well, they�"
�ve sent you a t
"idy sum,” said"
" Berg, eying the"
 heavy purse th
at sank into the
 sofa. “As for
" us, Count, we g"
et along on our 
 pay. I can tell
 you for myself.
..”  “I sa
"y, Berg, my dear"
" fellow,” said"
" Rostóv, “whe"

"Do go somewhere,"

"
exclaimed, and"
 immediately sei
zing him by the

king amiably in

dently wishing t

"

“Oh, don�"
"�t mention it, C"

"derstand,” sai"
"d Berg,
getting"
 up and speaking
 in a muffled an
d guttural voice
.  “Go acros
s to our hosts: 
they invited you
",” added Borí"
s.  Berg put o
n the cleanest o
"f coats, without"
 a spot or speck
" of dust,
stood"
 before a lookin
g glass and brus
hed the hair on 
his temples upw
"ards, in the way"
 affected by the
 Emperor Alexand
"er, and, having"
 assured himself
 from the way Ro
stóv looked at 
it that his coat
 had been notic
"ed, left the roo"
m with a pleasan
t smile.  “O
"h dear, what a b"
east I am!” mu
"ttered Rostóv, "
as he read the 
letter.  “Wh
"y?”

“Oh, "
"what a pig I am,"
 not to have wri
tten and to have
 given them suc
"h a fright! Oh, "
what a pig I am!
"” he repeated,"
 flushing sudden
"ly.
“Well, ha"
ve you sent Gabr
iel for some win
e? All right let
’s have some!
”  In the le
tter from his pa
rents was enclos
ed a letter of r
ecommendation t
o Bagratión whi
ch the old count
ess at Anna Mikh
áylovna’s adv
ice had obtaine
d through an acq
uaintance and se
"nt to her son, a"
sking him to tak
e it to its des
tination and mak
e use of it.  
“What nonsense
! Much I need it
!” said Rostó
"v, throwing the "
letter under th
e table.  “W
hy have you thro
wn that away?”
 asked Borís. 
 “It is some 
letter of recomm
endation... what
 the devil do I 
want it for!”
  “Why ‘Wh
at the devil’?
"” said Borís,"
 picking it up a
nd reading the 
address. “This
 letter would be
 of great use to
 you.”  “I
" want nothing, a"
nd I won’t be 
anyone’s adjut
ant.”  “Wh
y not?” inquir
ed Borís.  �
�It’s a lackey
’s job!”  
“You are still
 the same dreame
"r, I see,” rem"
"arked Borís, sh"
aking his head.
  “And you�
�re still the sa
me diplomatist! 
But that’s not
 the point... C
"ome, how are you"
?” asked Rost�
"�v.

“Well, "
as you see. So f
ar everything’
"s all right, but"
 I confess I sh
ould much like t
o be an adjutant
 and not remain 
at the front.”
  “Why?” 
 “Because whe
n once a man sta
rts on military 
"service, he shou"
ld try to make 
as successful a 
career of it as 
possible.”  
"“Oh, that’s "
it!” said Rost
"óv, evidently t"
hinking of somet
hing else.  H
e looked intentl
y and inquiringl
y into his frien
"d’s eyes, evid"
ently trying in
 vain to find th
e answer to some
 question.  Ol
d Gabriel brough
t in the wine. 
 “Shouldn’t
 we now send for
 Berg?” asked 
Borís. “He wo
uld drink with 
you. I can’t.�
"��

“Well, s"
end for him... a
nd how do you ge
t on with that G
erman?” asked
" Rostóv, with a"
 contemptuous sm
ile.  “He is
" a very, very ni"
"ce, honest, and "
"pleasant fellow,"
” answered Bo
rís.  Again R
ostóv looked in
tently into Bor�
�s’ eyes and s
ighed. Berg ret
"urned, and over "
the bottle of wi
ne conversation 
between the thre
e officers beca
me animated. The
 Guardsmen told 
Rostóv of their
 march and how 
they had been ma
de much of in Ru
"ssia, Poland, an"
d abroad. They s
poke of the say
ings and doings 
of their command
"er, the Grand Du"
"ke, and told
st"
ories of his kin
dness and irasci
"bility. Berg, as"
" usual, kept sil"
ent when the su
bject did not re
"late to himself,"
 but in connecti
on with the sto
ries of the Gran
d Duke’s quick
 temper he relat
ed with gusto ho
w in Galicia he
 had managed to 
deal with the Gr
and Duke when th
e latter made a
 tour of the reg
iments and was a
nnoyed at the ir
regularity of a
 movement. With 
a pleasant smile
 Berg related ho
w the Grand Duke
 had ridden up 
to him in a viol
"ent passion, sho"
uting: “Arnaut
s!” (“Arnau
ts” was the Ts
arévich’s fav
orite expression
 when he was in 
 a rage) and cal
led for the comp
any commander. 
 “Would you b
"elieve it, Count"
", I was not at a"
"ll alarmed, beca"
use I knew I wa
s right. Without
" boasting, you k"
"now, I may say t"
hat I know the A
rmy Orders by h
eart and know th
e Regulations as
 well as I do th
e Lord’s Pray
"er. So, Count, t"
here never is an
y negligence in 
"my company, and"
 so my conscienc
e was at ease. I
 came forward...
.” (Berg stood
 up and showed 
how he presented
" himself, with h"
is hand to his c
"ap, and really
"
it would have be
en difficult for
 a face to expre
ss greater respe
ct and self-com
placency than hi
"s did.) “Well,"
 he stormed at m
"e, as the saying"
"
is, stormed an"
d stormed and st
ormed! It was no
t a matter of li
fe but rather o
"f death, as the "
saying is. ‘Al
banians!’ and 
‘devils!’ a
nd ‘To Siberia
!’” said Ber
g with a sagacio
us smile. “I k
new I was in th
e right so I kep
t silent; was no
"t that best, Cou"
"nt?... ‘Hey,
"
are you dumb?’
 he shouted. Sti
ll I remained si
lent. And what d
"o you
think, Co"
unt? The next da
y it was not eve
n mentioned in t
he Orders of th
e Day. That’s 
what keeping one
’s head means.
 That’s the wa
"y,
Count,” sa"
"id Berg, lightin"
g his pipe and e
mitting rings of
 smoke.  “Ye
"s, that was fine"
",” said Rostó"
"v, smiling.

B"
ut Borís notice
d that he was pr
eparing to make 
"fun of Berg, and"
 skillfully cha
nged the subject
. He asked him t
o tell them how 
and where he go
t his wound. Thi
s pleased Rostó
v and he began t
"alking about it,"
 and as he went
 on became more 
and more animate
d. He told them 
of his Schön G
"rabern affair, j"
ust as those who
 have taken part
 in a battle ge
nerally do descr
"ibe it, that is,"
 as they would l
ike it to have b
"een,
as they ha"
ve heard it desc
"ribed by others,"
 and as sounds w
"ell, but not
at"
 all as it reall
y was. Rostóv w
as a truthful yo
ung man and woul
d on no account
 have told a del
iberate lie. He 
began his story 
meaning to tell
 everything just
" as it happened,"
 but imperceptib
"ly, involuntaril"
"y,
and inevitab"
ly he lapsed int
o falsehood. If 
he had told the 
truth to his he
arers—who like
 himself had oft
en heard stories
 of attacks and 
had formed a de
finite idea of w
hat an attack wa
s and were expec
ting to hear ju
st such a story�
��they would eit
her not have bel
"ieved him or, st"
"ill
worse, woul"
d have thought t
hat Rostóv was 
himself to blame
 since what gen
erally happens t
o the narrators 
of cavalry attac
ks had not happe
ned to him. He 
could not tell t
hem simply that 
everyone went at
 a trot and tha
t he fell off hi
s horse and spra
ined his arm and
 then ran as har
d as he could f
rom a Frenchman 
into the wood. B
"esides, to tell "
everything as i
t really happene
"d, it would have"
 been necessary 
to make an effor
t of will to te
ll only what hap
pened. It is ver
y difficult to t
"ell the truth,
"
and young people
 are rarely capa
ble of it. His h
earers expected 
a story of how 
beside himself a
nd all aflame wi
"th excitement, h"
e had flown like
 a storm at the
" square, cut his"
" way in, slashed"
" right and left,"
 how his saber 
had tasted flesh
 and he had fall
"en exhausted, an"
d so on. And so 
he told them al
l that.  In th
e middle of his 
"story, just as h"
e was saying: �
�You cannot imag
ine what a stra
nge frenzy one e
xperiences durin
"g an attack,” "
"Prince
Andrew, "
whom Borís was 
"expecting, enter"
ed the room. Pri
"nce Andrew, who"
 liked to help y
"oung men, was fl"
attered by being
 asked for his a
ssistance and b
eing well dispos
ed toward Borís
", who had manage"
d to please him 
"the
day before,"
 he wished to do
 what the young 
man wanted. Havi
ng been sent wi
th papers from K
utúzov to the T
"sarévich, he lo"
oked in on Borí
"s,
hoping to fi"
nd him alone. Wh
en he came in an
d saw an hussar 
of the line rec
ounting his mili
tary exploits (P
rince Andrew cou
ld not endure t
hat sort of man)
", he gave Borís"
 a pleasant smil
"e, frowned as wi"
th half-closed 
eyes he looked a
"t Rostóv, bowed"
 slightly and we
"arily, and
sat "
down languidly o
n the sofa: he f
elt it unpleasan
t to have droppe
d in on bad com
pany. Rostóv fl
ushed up on noti
"cing this, but h"
"e did not
care,"
 this was a mere
 stranger. Glanc
"ing, however, at"
" Borís, he saw"
 that he too see
med ashamed of t
he hussar of the
 line.  In spi
te of Prince And
rew’s disagree
"able, ironical t"
"one, in spite of"
 the contempt w
ith which Rostó
"v, from his figh"
ting army point 
"of view,
regard"
ed all these lit
tle adjutants on
 the staff of wh
om the newcomer 
 was evidently o
"ne, Rostóv felt"
" confused, blush"
"ed, and became s"
ilent. Borís i
nquired what new
s there might be
" on the staff, a"
"nd what, without"
"
indiscretion, "
one might ask ab
out our plans. 
 “We shall pr
"obably advance,�"
�� replied Bolk�
"�nski, evidently"
 reluctant to s
ay more in the p
resence of a str
anger.  Berg t
ook the opportun
"ity to ask, with"
 great politenes
"s, whether, as w"
"as
rumored, the"
 allowance of fo
rage money to ca
ptains of compan
ies would be do
ubled. To this P
rince Andrew ans
wered with a smi
le that he could
 give no opinio
n on such an imp
ortant governmen
"t order, and Ber"
g laughed gaily
.  “As to yo
"ur business,” "
Prince Andrew co
"ntinued, address"
"ing Borís,
“"
we will talk of 
it later” (and
 he looked round
 at Rostóv). �
�Come to me aft
er the review an
d we will do wha
t is possible.�
"�

And, having"
 glanced round t
"he room, Prince "
Andrew turned to
" Rostóv,
whose"
 state of unconq
uerable childish
 embarrassment n
ow changing to 
anger he did not
 condescend to n
"otice, and said:"
 “I think you 
were talking of
 the Schön Grab
ern affair? Were
 you there?” 
 “I was there
",” said Rostó"
"v angrily, as if"
 intending to in
sult the aide-d
e-camp.  Bolk�
�nski noticed th
e hussar’s sta
"te of mind, and "
it amused him. W
ith a slightly 
contemptuous smi
"le, he said: “"
"Yes, there are m"
any stories now
 told about that
 affair!”  �
"��Yes, stories!�"
�� repeated Rost
"óv loudly, look"
ing with eyes su
ddenly grown fu
"rious, now at Bo"
"rís, now at Bol"
"kónski. “Yes,"
 many stories! 
But our stories 
are the stories 
of men who have 
been under the e
nemy’s fire! 
Our stories have
" some weight, no"
t like the stori
es of those fel
lows on the staf
f who get reward
s without doing 
anything!”  
“Of whom you i
magine me to be 
one?” said Pri
"nce Andrew, with"
 a quiet and pa
rticularly amiab
le smile.  A s
trange feeling o
f exasperation a
nd yet of respec
t for this man�
�s self-possess
ion mingled at t
hat moment in Ro
stóv’s soul. 
  “I am not t
alking about you
",” he said, �"
�I don’t know 
"you and,
frankl"
"y, I don’t wan"
t to. I am speak
ing of the staff
 in general.” 
  “And I will
" tell you this,�"
�� Prince Andrew
 interrupted in 
a tone of quiet
" authority, “y"
ou wish to insul
"t me, and I am r"
eady to agree wi
th you that it 
would be very ea
sy to do so if y
ou haven’t suf
ficient self-re

 that the time a

 In a day or two
 we shall all ha

" However,” he "
"added rising, �"
�you know my nam

’t forget that
 I do not regard

"hen, on Friday a"
fter the review 
 I shall expect 
"you, Drubetskóy"
. Au revoir!” 
exclaimed Prince
" Andrew,
and wi"
th a bow to them
 both he went ou
t.  Only when 
Prince Andrew wa
s gone did Rost�
�v think of what
 he ought to ha
ve said. And he 
was still more a
ngry at having o
mitted to say it
. He ordered hi
s horse at once 
"and, coldly taki"
ng leave of Bor�
"�s, rode
home. "
Should he go to 
headquarters nex
t day and challe
nge that affecte
"d
adjutant, or "
really let the m

the question tha
t worried him a
ll the way. He t
hought angrily o
f the pleasure h
e would have at 
 seeing the frig
ht of that small
 and frail but p
roud man when co
vered by his pi

e felt with surp

 there was none

CHAPTER VIII  
The day after Ro
stóv had been t
"o see Borís, a "
review was held 
of the Austrian
 and Russian tro
"ops, both those "
freshly arrived 
from Russia and 
 those who had b
een campaigning 
under Kutúzov. 
The two Emperors
",
the Russian w"
ith his heir the
" Tsarévich, and"
 the Austrian wi
th the Archduke
", inspected the "
allied army of e
ighty thousand m
en.  From earl
y morning the sm
art clean troops
 were on the mov
"e, forming up
o"
n the field befo
re the fortress.
 Now thousands o
f feet and bayon
ets moved and h
alted at the off
icers’ command
", turned with ba"
"nners flying,
f"
ormed up at inte
"rvals, and wheel"
ed round other s
imilar masses of
 infantry in di
fferent uniforms
; now was heard 
the rhythmic bea
t of hoofs and 
the jingling of 
showy cavalry in
" blue, red, and "
green braided u
"niforms, with sm"
artly dressed ba
ndsmen in front 
mounted on black
", roan,
or gray"
 horses; then ag
"ain, spreading o"
ut with the braz
en clatter of th
e polished shin
ing cannon that 
quivered on the 
gun carriages an
d with the smel
"l of linstocks, "
came the artille
ry which crawled
 between the in
fantry and caval
ry and took up i
ts appointed pos
ition. Not only 
the generals in
 full parade uni
"forms, with thei"
r thin or thick 
waists drawn in
" to the utmost, "
their red necks 
squeezed into th
eir stiff collar
"s, and
wearing "
scarves and all 
their decoration
"s, not only the "
"elegant, pomaded"
"
officers, but "
every soldier wi
th his freshly w
ashed and shaven
 face and his w
eapons clean and
 polished to the
" utmost, and eve"
ry horse groomed
 till its coat 
shone like satin
 and every hair 
of its wetted ma
ne lay smooth�
�felt that no sm
all matter was h
"appening, but an"
 important and 
solemn affair. E
very general and
 every soldier w
as conscious of 
his own insigni
"ficance, aware o"
f being but a dr
op in that ocean
" of men, and
ye"
t at the same ti
me was conscious
 of his strength
 as a part of th
at enormous who
le.  From earl
y morning strenu
ous activities a
nd efforts had b
egun and by ten 
 o’clock all h
ad been brought 
into due order. 
The ranks were d
rawn up on the 
vast field. The 
whole army was e
xtended in three
 lines: the cav
"alry in front, b"
ehind it the art
"illery, and behi"
nd that again th
e infantry.  
A space like a s
treet was left b
etween each two 
lines of troops.
 The three part
s of that army w
ere sharply dist
inguished: Kutú
zov’s fightin
g army (with the
 Pávlograds on 
the right flank 
of the front); 
those recently a
rrived from Russ
"ia, both Guards "
and regiments of
 the line; and 
the Austrian tro
ops. But they al
l stood in the s
"ame lines,
unde"
"r one command, a"
nd in a like ord
er.  Like wind
 over leaves ran
 an excited whis
per: “They’r
e coming! They�
��re coming!” 
Alarmed voices w
"ere heard, and a"
 stir of final 
preparation swep
t over all the t
roops.  From t
he direction of 
Olmütz in front
" of them, a grou"
p was seen appr
oaching. And at 
"that moment, tho"
ugh the day was 
"still, a light g"
ust of wind blo
wing over the ar
my slightly stir
red the streamer
s on the lances
 and the unfolde
d standards flut
tered against th
eir staffs. It 
looked as if by 
that slight moti
on the army itse
lf was expressin
g its joy at th
e approach of th
e Emperors. One 
voice was heard 
shouting: “Ey
es front!” The
"n, like the crow"
ing of cocks at 
"sunrise, this wa"
s repeated by o
thers from vario
us sides and all
 became silent. 
  In the deathl
ike stillness on
ly the tramp of 
horses was heard
. This was the 
Emperors’ suit
es. The Emperors
 rode up to the 
"flank, and the
"
trumpets of the 
first cavalry re
giment played th
e general march.
 It seemed as t
hough not the tr
umpeters were pl
"aying, but as if"
 the army itsel
"f, rejoicing at "
the Emperors’ 
"approach, had na"
turally burst in
to music. Amid 
"these sounds, on"
ly the youthful 
kindly voice of 
the Emperor Ale
xander was clear
ly heard. He gav
e the words of g
"reeting, and the"
 first regiment
 roared “Hurra
h!” so deafeni
"ngly, continuous"
"ly, and
joyfull"
y that the men t
hemselves were a
wed by their mul
titude and the 
immensity of the
 power they cons
tituted.  Rost
"óv, standing in"
 the front lines
 of Kutúzov’s
 army which the 
Tsar approached
" first, experien"
ced the same fee
ling as every ot
her man in that
 army: a feeling
 of self-forgetf
"ulness, a proud "
consciousness of
"
might, and a p"
assionate attrac
tion to him who 
was the cause of
 this triumph. 
  He felt that 
at a single word
 from that man a
ll this vast mas
s (and he himse
lf an insignific
ant atom in it) 
would go through
" fire and water,"
"
commit crime, "
"die, or perform "
deeds of highest
" heroism, and so"
 he could not b
ut tremble and h
is heart stand s
till at the immi
nence of that wo
rd.  “Hurrah
! Hurrah! Hurrah
!” thundered f
"rom all sides, o"
ne regiment aft
er another greet
ing the Tsar wit
h the strains of
" the march, and "
then “Hurrah!
”... Then the 
"general march, a"
nd again “Hurr
ah! Hurrah!” 
growing ever str
onger and fuller
 and merging int
o a deafening ro
ar.  Till the 
"Tsar reached it,"
 each regiment i
n its silence an
d immobility se
emed like a life
"less body, but a"
s soon as he cam
e up it became a
"live,
its thund"
er joining the r
oar of the whole
 line along whic
h he had alread
y passed. Throug
h the terrible a
nd deafening roa
r of those voice
"s,
amid the squ"
are masses of tr
oops standing mo
tionless as if t
"urned to
stone,"
 hundreds of rid
ers composing th
e suites moved c
arelessly but s
ymmetrically and
 above all freel
"y, and in front "
of them two men�
��the Emperors.
 Upon them the u
"ndivided, tensel"
y passionate att
ention of that 
whole mass of me
n was concentrat
ed.  The hands
ome young Empero
"r Alexander, in "
the uniform of t
he Horse Guards
", wearing a cock"
ed hat with its 
peaks front and 
"back, with his
"
pleasant face an
d resonant thoug
h not loud voice
", attracted ever"
yone’s attent
ion.  Rostóv 
was not far from
" the trumpeters,"
 and with his ke
en sight had re
cognized the Tsa
r and watched hi
s approach. When
 he was within t
"wenty
paces, an"
d Nicholas could
 clearly disting
uish every detai
l of his handso
"me, happy young "
"face, he experie"
nced a feeling o
f tenderness an
d ecstasy such a
s he had never b
efore known. Eve
ry trait and eve
ry movement of 
the Tsar’s see
med to him encha
nting.  Stoppi
ng in front of t
"he Pávlograds, "
the Tsar said so
mething in Frenc
h to the Austri
an Emperor and s
miled.  Seeing
" that smile, Ros"
tóv involuntari
ly smiled himsel
f and felt a sti
ll stronger flo
w of love for hi
s sovereign. He 
longed to show t
hat love in som
e way and knowin
g that this was 
impossible was r
eady to cry. The
 Tsar called th
e colonel of the
 regiment and sa
id a few words t
o him.  “Oh 
"God, what would "
happen to me if 
the Emperor spok
e to me?” tho
ught Rostóv. �
�I should die of
 happiness!” 
 The Tsar addre
ssed the officer
s also: “I tha
"nk you all, gent"
"lemen, I
thank "
you with my whol
e heart.” To R
ostóv every wor
d sounded like a
 voice from hea
ven. How gladly 
would he have di
ed at once for h
is Tsar!  “Y
ou have earned t
he St. George’
s standards and 
will be worthy o
f them.”  �
"��Oh, to die, to"
" die for him,”"
 thought Rostóv
.  The Tsar sa
id something mor
e which Rostóv 
"did not hear, an"
"d the
soldiers,"
 straining their
" lungs, shouted "
“Hurrah!”  
"
Rostóv too, be"
nding over his s
"addle, shouted �"
��Hurrah!” wit
h all his might
", feeling that h"
e would like to 
injure himself b
"y that shout, if"
 only to expres
s his rapture fu
lly.  The Tsar
 stopped a few m
inutes in front 
of the hussars a
s if undecided. 
  “How can th
e Emperor be und
ecided?” thoug
"ht Rostóv, but "
then even this 
indecision appea
red to him majes
tic and enchanti
"ng, like everyth"
ing else the Ts
ar did.  That 
hesitation laste
d only an instan
t. The Tsar’s 
"foot, in the nar"
row pointed boo
t then fashionab
"le, touched the "
groin of the bob
tailed bay mare
" he rode, his ha"
nd in a white gl
ove gathered up 
"the reins, and h"
e moved off acc
ompanied by an i
rregularly swayi
ng sea of aides-
de-camp. Farthe
r and farther he
" rode away, stop"
ping at other re
"giments, till at"
 last only his 
white plumes wer
e visible to Ros
tóv from amid t
he suites that 
surrounded the E
mperors.  Amon
g the gentlemen 
"of the suite, Ro"
stóv noticed Bo
"lkónski, sittin"
g his horse ind
olently and care
lessly. Rostóv 
recalled their q
uarrel of yeste
rday and the que
stion presented 
itself whether h
e ought or ought
 not to challen
ge Bolkónski. �
��Of course not!
” he now thoug
ht. “Is it wo
rth thinking or 
speaking of it a
t such a moment?
 At a time of su
"ch
love, such r"
"apture, and such"
" self-sacrifice,"
 what do any of 
our quarrels an
d affronts matte
r? I love and fo
rgive everybody 
now.”  When 
the Emperor had 
passed nearly al
"l the regiments,"
 the troops bega
n a ceremonial 
"march past him, "
and Rostóv on B
"edouin, recently"
 purchased from
" Denísov, rode "
"past too, at the"
 rear of his squ
"adron—that is,"
 alone and in f
ull view of the 
Emperor.  Befo
re he reached hi
"m, Rostóv, who "
was a splendid h
"orseman, spurred"
 Bedouin twice 
and successfully
 put him to the 
showy trot in wh
ich the animal 
went when excite
d. Bending his f
oaming muzzle to
" his chest, his"
"
tail extended, "
"Bedouin, as if a"
lso conscious of
 the Emperor’s
" eye
upon him, "
passed splendidl
"y, lifting his f"
eet with a high 
and graceful ac
"tion, as if flyi"
ng through the a
ir without touch
ing the ground. 
  Rostóv himse
"lf, his legs wel"
l back and his s
tomach drawn in 
and feeling him
self one with hi
"s horse, rode pa"
st the Emperor w
ith a frowning b
ut blissful fac
e “like a vewy
" devil,” as De"
nísov expressed
 it.  “Fine 
"fellows, the Pá"
vlograds!” rem
arked the Empero
"r.

“My God,"
 how happy I sho
uld be if he ord
ered me to leap 
into the fire t
his instant!” 
thought Rostóv.
  When the rev
"iew was over, th"
e newly arrived 
"officers, and al"
so Kutúzov’s
", collected in g"
roups and began 
to talk about th
"e awards,
about"
 the Austrians a
nd their uniform
"s, about their l"
"ines, about
Bon"
"aparte, and how "
badly the latter
" would fare now,"
 especially if t
he Essen corps 
arrived and Prus
sia took our sid
e.  But the ta
lk in every grou
p was chiefly ab
out the Emperor 
Alexander. His 
every word and m
ovement was desc
ribed with ecsta
sy.  They all 
had but one wish
: to advance as 
soon as possible
 against the en
emy under the Em
peror’s comman
d. Commanded by 
the Emperor hims
elf they could 
not fail to vanq
"uish anyone, be "
it whom it might
: so thought Ro
stóv and most o
f the officers a
fter the review.
  All were the
n more confident
 of victory than
 the winning of 
two battles wou
ld have made the
m.      CH
APTER IX  The 
day after the re
"view, Borís, in"
 his best unifor
m and with his 
comrade Berg’s
 best wishes for
" success, rode t"
o Olmütz to see
"
Bolkónski, wi"
shing to profit 
by his friendlin
ess and obtain f
or himself the 
best post he cou
ld—preferably 
that of adjutant
 to some importa
"nt
personage, a"
 position in the
 army which seem
ed to him most a
ttractive. “I
t is all very we
"ll for Rostóv, "
whose father sen
ds him ten thous
and rubles at a
" time, to talk a"
bout not wishing
 to cringe to an
ybody and not b
e anyone’s lac
"key, but I who h"
ave nothing but 
my brains have t
o make a career
 and must not mi
ss opportunities
", but must avail"
 myself of them
!” he reflecte
d.  He did not
 find Prince And
rew in Olmütz t
"hat day, but the"
 appearance of 
the town where t
he headquarters 
and the diplomat
ic corps were st
ationed and the
 two Emperors we
re living with t
"heir suites, hou"
"seholds, and
co"
urts only streng
thened his desir
e to belong to t
hat higher world
.  He knew no 
"one, and despite"
 his smart Guard
sman’s uniform
", all these
exa"
lted personages 
passing in the s
treets in their 
elegant carriage
s with their pl
"umes, ribbons, a"
"nd medals, both "
courtiers and mi
"litary
men, see"
med so immeasura
"bly above him, a"
n insignificant 
officer of the 
"Guards, that the"
y not only did n
"ot wish to, but "
simply could not
", be
aware of h"
is existence. At
 the quarters of
 the commander i
"n chief,
Kutúz"
"ov, where he inq"
uired for Bolkó
"nski, all the ad"
jutants and even
 the orderlies 
looked at him as
 if they wished 
to impress on hi
m that a great 
many officers li
ke him were alwa
ys coming there 
and that everybo
dy was heartily
 sick of them. I
"n spite of this,"
 or rather becau
"se of
it, next "
"day, November 15"
", after dinner h"
e again went to 
"Olmütz and,
en"
tering the house
 occupied by Kut
"úzov, asked for"
 Bolkónski. Pri
nce Andrew was 
in and Borís wa
s shown into a l
arge hall probab
ly formerly use
"d for dancing, b"
ut in which five
" beds now stood,"
 and furniture o
f various kinds
": a table, chair"
"s, and a clavich"
ord. One adjutan
"t, nearest
the "
"door, was sittin"
g at the table i
n a Persian dres
"sing gown, writi"
"ng.
Another, th"
"e red, stout Nes"
"vítski, lay on "
a bed with his a
rms under his h
"ead, laughing wi"
th an officer wh
o had sat down b
eside him. A thi
rd was playing 
a Viennese waltz
 on the clavicho
"rd, while a four"
"th, lying on
th"
"e clavichord, sa"
ng the tune. Bol
kónski was not 
there. None of t
hese gentlemen 
changed his posi
tion on seeing B
orís. The one w
ho was writing 
and whom Borís 
addressed turned
 round crossly a
nd told him Bolk
ónski was on d
uty and that he 
should go throug
h the door on th
e left into the 
 reception room 
if he wished to 
see him. Borís 
thanked him and 
went to the rec
"eption room, whe"
re he found some
 ten officers an
d generals.  W
"hen he entered, "
"Prince Andrew, h"
is eyes drooping
 contemptuously 
(with that pecu
liar expression 
of polite wearin
ess which plainl
"y says, “If
i"
t were not my du
ty I would not t
alk to you for a
" moment”), was"
 listening to a
n old Russian ge
neral with decor
"ations, who stoo"
"d very
erect, a"
"lmost on tiptoe,"
 with a soldier�
��s obsequious e
xpression on his
"
purple face, r"
eporting somethi
ng.  “Very w
"ell, then, be so"
 good as to wait
",” said Prince"
 Andrew to the 
"general, in Russ"
"ian, speaking wi"
th the French in
tonation he affe
cted when he wi
shed to speak co
"ntemptuously, an"
d noticing Borí
"s, Prince
Andre"
"w, paying no mor"
e heed to the ge
neral who ran af
ter him implorin
g him to hear s
"omething more, n"
odded and turned
 to him with a c
heerful smile. 
  At that momen
t Borís clearly
 realized what h
e had before sur
"mised, that
in "
"the army, beside"
s the subordinat
ion and discipli
ne prescribed in
 the military c
"ode, which he an"
d the others kne
w in the regimen
"t, there was
an"
"other, more impo"

 this tight-lace
"d,
purple-faced"
 general wait re
spectfully while
 Captain Prince 
"Andrew, for
his"
" own pleasure, c"
hose to chat wit
h Lieutenant Dru
betskóy. More t
han ever was Bo
rís resolved to
 serve in future
 not according t
o the written c
"ode, but under t"
his unwritten la
w. He felt now t
hat merely by ha
ving been recom
mended to Prince
 Andrew he had a
lready risen abo
ve the general 
who at the front
 had the power t
o annihilate him
", a lieutenant o"
f the Guards. P
rince Andrew cam
e up to him and 
took his hand. 
 “I am very s
orry you did not
 find me in yest

 Germans all day
. We went with W

�s no end to it!
”  Borís sm
"iled, as if he u"
nderstood what P
rince Andrew was
 alluding to as
 something gener
ally known. But 
it was the first
 time he had hea
rd Weyrother’
"s name, or even "
the term “disp
ositions.”  
"“Well, my dear"
" fellow, so you "
still want to be
 an adjutant? I 
have been think
ing about you.�
"�

“Yes, I w"
as thinking”�
�for some reason
 Borís could no
t help blushing
—“of asking 
the commander in

ad a letter from
 Prince Kurági
n about me. I on
ly wanted to ask
 because I fear 
the Guards won�
��t be in action
",” he added as"
 if in apology. 
"

“All right,"
 all right. We�
�ll talk it over
",” replied Pri"
nce Andrew. “
Only let me repo
rt this gentlema

and I shall be a

.”  While Pr
ince Andrew went
 to report about
 the purple-face
"d general, that"
 gentleman—evi
dently not shari
ng Borís’ con
ception of the a
dvantages of th
e unwritten code
 of subordinatio
n—looked so fi
xedly at the pr
esumptuous lieut
enant who had pr
evented his fini
shing what he ha
d to say to the
 adjutant that B
orís felt uncom
fortable. He tur
ned away and wa
ited impatiently
 for Prince Andr
ew’s return fr
om the commander
 in chief’s r
oom.  “You s
"ee, my dear fell"
"ow, I have been "
thinking about y
"ou,”
said Pri"
nce Andrew when 
they had gone in
to the large roo
m where the cla
vichord was. “
It’s no use yo
ur going to the 
commander in chi
ef. He would sa
y a lot of pleas

you to dinner”
 (“That would
 not be bad as r
egards the unwri

"ought Borís),
"
“but nothing m

 Prince Andrew a

cially keen when
 he had to guide
 a young man an

 this kind for a
"nother, which fr"
om pride he woul
d never accept f
"or
himself, he "
kept in touch wi
th the circle wh
ich confers succ
ess and which a
ttracted him. He
 very readily to
ok up Borís’ 
cause and went 
with him to Dolg
orúkov.  It w
as late in the e
vening when they
 entered the pal
ace at Olmütz 
occupied by the 
Emperors and the
ir retinues.  
That same day a 
council of war h
ad been held in 
which all the me
mbers of the Ho
fkriegsrath and 
both Emperors to
ok part. At that
" council, contra"
ry to the views
 of the old gene
rals Kutúzov an
d Prince Schwart
"zenberg, it
had"
 been decided to
 advance immedia
tely and give ba
ttle to Bonapart
e. The council 
of war was just 
over when Prince
 Andrew accompan
ied by Borís a
rrived at the pa
lace to find Dol
gorúkov. Everyo
ne at headquart
ers was still un
der the spell of
 the day’s cou
"ncil, at which
"
the party of the
 young had trium
phed. The voices
 of those who co
unseled delay a
nd advised waiti
ng for something
 else before adv
ancing had been 
 so completely s
ilenced and thei
r arguments conf
uted by such con
clusive evidenc
e of the advanta
ges of attacking
 that what had b
een discussed a
t the council—
the coming battl
e and the victor
y that would cer
tainly result f
rom it—no long
er seemed to be 
in the future bu
t in the past. 
All the advantag
es were on our s
ide. Our enormou
"s forces, undoub"
tedly superior 
"to Napoleon’s,"
 were concentrat
"ed in one place,"
 the troops ins
pired by the Emp
erors’ presenc
e were eager for
 action. The st
rategic position
 where the opera
tions would take
 place was famil
iar in all its 
details to the A
ustrian General 
Weyrother: a luc
ky accident had 
 ordained that t
he Austrian army
 should maneuver
 the previous ye
ar on the very 
fields where the
 French had now 
to be fought; th
e adjacent loca
lity was known a
nd shown in ever
y detail on the 
"maps, and Bonapa"
"rte,
evidently "
"weakened, was un"
dertaking nothin
g.  Dolgorúko
"v, one of the wa"
rmest advocates 
"of an attack, ha"
d just returned
 from the counci
"l, tired and exh"
austed but eager
 and proud of t
he victory that 
had been gained.
 Prince Andrew i
ntroduced his p
"rotégé, but Pr"
ince Dolgorúkov
 politely and fi
rmly pressing hi
s hand said not
hing to Borís a
"nd, evidently un"
able to suppress
 the thoughts w
hich were upperm
ost in his mind 
"at that moment, "
addressed Prince
 Andrew in Fren
"ch.

“Ah, my"
" dear fellow, wh"
at a battle we h
ave gained! God 
grant that the 
one that will re
sult from it wil
l be as victorio
"us! However, dea"
"r
fellow,” he"
 said abruptly a
"nd eagerly, “I"
 must confess to
 having been un
just to the Aust
rians and especi
ally to Weyrothe
r. What exactit
"ude, what minute"
"ness, what knowl"
edge of the loca

" my dear fellow,"
 no conditions b

nation of Austri
an precision wit

—what more cou
ld be wished for
?”  “So th
e attack is defi
nitely resolved 
on?” asked Bol
kónski.  “A
"nd do you know, "
"my dear fellow, "
it seems to me t
hat Bonaparte ha
s decidedly los
"t bearings, you "
know that a lett
er was received 
from him today 
for the Emperor.
” Dolgorúkov 
smiled significa
ntly.  “Is t
hat so? And what
 did he say?” 
inquired Bolkón
ski.  “What 
can he say? Tra-
di-ri-di-ra and 
so on... merely 
to gain time. I
 tell you he is 
"in our hands, th"
at’s certain! 
But what was mos
"t
amusing,” h"
"e continued, wit"
"h a sudden, good"
"-natured laugh, "
“was that we 
could not think 
how to address t
he reply! If not
 as ‘Consul’
 and of course 
not as ‘Empero
"r,’ it seemed "
to me it should 
be to ‘Genera
l Bonaparte.’�
��  “But bet
ween not recogni
zing him as Empe
ror and calling 
him General Bon
"aparte, there is"
" a difference,�"
� remarked Bolk�
�nski.  “Tha
"t’s just it,�"
� interrupted Do
lgorúkov quickl
"y, laughing.
�"
�You know Bilíb
in—he’s a ve
ry clever fellow
. He suggested 
addressing him a
s ‘Usurper and
 Enemy of Mankin

orúkov laughed 
merrily.  “O
nly that?” sai
d Bolkónski.  
 “All the same
", it was Bilíbi"
n who found a su
itable form for 
the address. He
 is a wise and c
lever fellow.”
  “What was 
it?”  “To 
the Head of the 
French Governmen
t... Au chef du 
gouvernement fr
"ançais,” said"
" Dolgorúkov, wi"
th grave satisfa
"ction. “Good,"
 wasn’t it?”
"

“Yes, but "
he will dislike 
"it extremely,”"
 said Bolkónski
".

“Oh yes, "
very much! My br
"other knows him,"
 he’s dined wi
th him—the pr

more than once i
"n Paris, and tel"
ls me he never m
et a more cunni

"now, a combinati"

e tale about him
 and Count Mark
óv? Count Mark�
�v was the only 
man who knew how
 to handle him.
 You know the st
ory of the handk
erchief? It is d
elightful!”  
 And the talkati
"ve Dolgorúkov, "
turning now to B
"orís, now to Pr"
"ince
Andrew, to"
ld how Bonaparte
 wishing to test
" Markóv, our am"
"bassador,
purpo"
sely dropped a h
andkerchief in f
ront of him and 
stood looking a
"t Markóv, proba"
bly expecting Ma
rkóv to pick it
" up for him, and"
 how Markóv im
mediately droppe
d his own beside
 it and picked i
t up without to
uching Bonaparte
’s.  “Deli
ghtful!” said 
Bolkónski. “B
ut I have come t
"o you, Prince,
"
as a petitioner 
on behalf of thi
s young man. You
 see...” but 
before Prince An
drew could finis
"h, an aide-de-ca"
mp came in to su
mmon Dolgorúko
v to the Emperor
".

“Oh, what"
" a nuisance,” "
said Dolgorúkov
", getting up hur"
riedly and pres
sing the hands o
f Prince Andrew 
and Borís. “Y
ou know I should
 be very glad t
o do all in my p
ower both for yo
u and for this d
ear young man.�
�� Again he pres
sed the hand of 
the latter with 
an expression of
"
good-natured, "
"sincere, and ani"
mated levity. �
�But you see... 
another time!�
�  Borís was 
excited by the t
hought of being 
so close to the 
higher powers a
s he felt himsel
f to be at that 
moment. He was c
onscious that he
re he was in co
ntact with the s
prings that set 
in motion the en
ormous movement
s of the mass of
 which in his re
giment he felt h
"imself a tiny,
"
"obedient, and in"
significant atom
. They followed 
Prince Dolgorúk
ov out into the
 corridor and me
t—coming out o
f the door of th
e Emperor’s r
oom by which Dol
gorúkov had ent
ered—a short m
an in civilian c
lothes with a c
lever face and s
harply projectin
"g jaw which, wit"
hout spoiling h
"is face, gave hi"
m a peculiar viv
acity and shifti
ness of expressi
on. This short 
man nodded to Do
lgorúkov as to 
an intimate frie
nd and stared a
t Prince Andrew 
with cool intens
"ity, walking str"
aight toward him
 and evidently 
expecting him to
 bow or to step 
out of his way. 
Prince Andrew d
id neither: a lo
ok of animosity 
appeared on his 
face and the oth
er turned away 
and went down th
e side of the co
rridor.  “Wh
o was that?” a
sked Borís.  
“He is one of 
the most remarka
"ble, but to me m"
ost unpleasant o

ki.... It is su
ch men as he who

added Bolkónski
 with a sigh he
 could not suppr
"ess, as they pas"
sed out of the p
alace.  Next d
"ay, the army beg"
"an its campaign,"
 and up to the v
ery battle of A
"usterlitz, Borí"
s was unable to 
see either Princ

orúkov again a
nd remained for 
a while with the
 Ismáylov regim
ent.      
CHAPTER X  At 
dawn on the sixt
eenth of Novembe
"r, Denísov’s "
"squadron, in
wh"
ich Nicholas Ros
tóv served and 
which was in Pri
nce Bagratión�
"�s
detachment, "
moved from the p
lace where it ha
d spent the nigh
"t, advancing
in"
to action as arr
"anged, and after"
 going behind ot
her columns for 
 about two third
s of a mile was 
stopped on the h
ighroad. Rostóv
 saw the Cossac
ks and then the 
first and second
 squadrons of hu
ssars and infant
ry battalions a
nd artillery pas
s by and go forw
ard and then Gen
erals Bagratió
n and Dolgorúko
v ride past with
 their adjutants
. All the fear 
before action wh
ich he had exper
ienced as previo
"usly, all the in"
ner struggle to
 conquer that fe
"ar, all his drea"
ms of distinguis
hing himself as
 a true hussar i
"n this battle, h"
ad been wasted. 
Their squadron 
remained in rese
rve and Nicholas
 Rostóv spent t
hat day in a dul
l and wretched 
mood. At nine in
" the morning, he"
 heard firing in
 front and shou
"ts of hurrah, an"
d saw wounded be
ing brought back
 (there were not
"
many of them),"
 and at last he 
saw how a whole 
detachment of Fr
ench cavalry wa
"s brought in, co"
nvoyed by a sót
nya of Cossacks.
 Evidently the 
affair was over 
"and, though not "
"big, had been a "
successful engag
ement. The men 
and officers ret
urning spoke of 
a brilliant vict
"ory, of the
occ"
upation of the t
own of Wischau a
nd the capture o
f a whole French
 squadron. The 
day was bright a
nd sunny after a
 sharp night fro
"st, and
the che"
erful glitter of
 that autumn day
 was in keeping 
with the news of
 victory which 
"was conveyed, no"
t only by the ta
les of those who
 had taken part
" in it, but also"
 by the joyful e
xpression on the
 faces of soldie
"rs,
officers, g"
"enerals, and adj"
"utants, as they "
passed Rostóv g
oing or coming.
" And Nicholas, w"
ho had vainly su
ffered all the d
read that prece
des a battle and
 had spent that 
happy day in ina
"ctivity, was all"
 the more depre
ssed.  “Come
" here, Wostóv. "
Let’s dwink to
 dwown our gwief
!” shouted De
"nísov, who had "
settled down by 
the roadside wit
h a flask and so
me food.  The
 officers gather
ed round Deníso
"v’s canteen, e"
ating and talkin
g.  “There! 
They are bringin
g another!” cr
ied one of the o
"fficers,
indica"
ting a captive F
rench dragoon wh
o was being brou
ght in on foot b
y two Cossacks.
  One of them 
was leading by t
he bridle a fine
 large French ho
rse he had take
n from the priso
ner.  “Sell 
us that horse!�
� Denísov calle
d out to the Cos
sacks.  “If 
"you like, your h"
onor!”  The 
officers got up 
and stood round 
the Cossacks and
 their prisoner.
 The French dra
goon was a young
 Alsatian who sp
oke French with 
a German accent
. He was breathl
ess with agitati
"on, his face was"
" red, and when
"
he heard some Fr
ench spoken he a
t once began spe
aking to the off
"icers,
addressi"
"ng first one, th"
en another. He s
aid he would not
 have been take
"n, it was not hi"
s fault but the 
corporal’s who
 had sent him to
 seize some hor
"secloths, though"
 he had told him
 the Russians we
re there. And a
t every word he 
added: “But do
n’t hurt my li
ttle horse!” a
nd stroked the 
animal. It was p
lain that he did
 not quite grasp
 where he was. 
Now he excused h
imself for havin
g been taken pri
"soner and now,
"
imagining himsel
f before his own
" officers, insis"
ted on his soldi
erly discipline
 and zeal in the
 service. He bro
ught with him in
to our rearguar
d all the freshn
ess of atmospher
e of the French 
"army, which was"
 so alien to us.
  The Cossacks
 sold the horse 
for two gold pie
"ces, and Rostóv"
", being the
ric"
hest of the offi
cers now that he
 had received hi
"s money, bought "
it.  “But do
n’t hurt my li
ttle horse!” s
aid the Alsatian
 good-naturedly 
 to Rostóv when
 the animal was 
handed over to t
he hussar.  Ro
stóv smilingly 
reassured the dr
agoon and gave h
im money.  “
Alley! Alley!”
 said the Cossac
"k, touching the "
prisoner’s arm
 to make him go
 on.  “The E
mperor! The Empe
ror!” was sudd
enly heard among
 the hussars.  
 All began to ru
"n and bustle, an"
d Rostóv saw co
ming up the road
 behind him sev
eral riders with
 white plumes in
 their hats. In 
a moment everyon
e was in his pl
"ace, waiting.
"
 Rostóv did not
 know or remembe
r how he ran to 
his place and mo
unted. Instantl
y his regret at 
not having been 
in action and hi
s dejected mood 
 amid people of 
whom he was wear
"y had gone, inst"
antly every thou
ght of himself 
had vanished. He
 was filled with
 happiness at hi
s nearness to t
he Emperor. He f
elt that this ne
arness by itself
 made up to him 
for the day he 
had lost. He was
 happy as a love
r when the longe
d-for moment of 
 meeting arrives
. Not daring to 
look round and w
ithout looking r
"ound, he
was ec"
statically consc
ious of his appr
oach. He felt it
 not only from t
he sound of the
 hoofs of the ap
proaching cavalc
"ade, but because"
 as he drew nea
r everything gre
"w brighter, more"
" joyful, more si"
"gnificant, and m"
ore festive aro
und him. Nearer 
and nearer to Ro
stóv came that 
sun shedding be
ams of mild and 
majestic light a
"round, and alrea"
dy he felt himse
lf enveloped in
" those beams, he"
 heard his voice
", that kindly, c"
"alm,
and majest"
ic voice that wa
s yet so simple!
 And as if in ac
cord with Rost�
"�v’s feeling, "
there was a deat
hly stillness am
id which was hea
rd the Emperor�
��s voice.  �
�The Pávlograd 
hussars?” he i
nquired.  “T
"he reserves, sir"
e!” replied a 
"voice, a very hu"
man one compared
 to that which 
had said: “The
 Pávlograd huss
ars?”  The E
mperor drew leve
l with Rostóv a
nd halted. Alexa
nder’s face wa
s even more bea
utiful than it h
ad been three da
ys before at the
 review. It sho
ne with such gai
"ety and youth, s"
uch innocent you
"th, that it sugg"
ested the livel
iness of a fourt
een-year-old boy
", and yet it was"
 the face of th
e majestic Emper
"or. Casually, wh"
ile surveying th
"e squadron, the"
 Emperor’s eye
s met Rostóv’
s and rested on 
them for not mor
e than two seco
nds. Whether or 
no the Emperor u
nderstood what w
as going on in 
Rostóv’s soul
 (it seemed to R
ostóv that he u
nderstood everyt
"hing),
at any r"
ate his light-bl
ue eyes gazed fo
r about two seco
nds into Rostó
v’s face. A ge
"ntle, mild light"
 poured from the
m. Then all at 
once he raised h
"is eyebrows, abr"
uptly touched hi
s horse with his
" left
foot, and"
 galloped on.  
 The younger Emp
eror could not r
estrain his wish
 to be present a
t the battle an
"d, in spite of t"
he remonstrances
 of his courtier
"s, at twelve
o�"
��clock left the
 third column wi
th which he had 
been and gallope
d toward the va
nguard. Before h
e came up with t
"he hussars, seve"
ral adjutants m
et him with news
 of the successf
ul result of the
 action.  This
" battle, which c"
onsisted in the 
capture of a Fre
"nch squadron, wa"
s represented a
s a brilliant vi
ctory over the F
"rench, and so th"
e Emperor and t
"he whole army, e"
specially while 
the smoke hung o
ver the battlef
"ield, believed t"
hat the French h
ad been defeated
 and were retre
ating against th
eir will. A few 
minutes after th
e Emperor had p
"assed, the Pávl"
ograd division w
as ordered to ad
vance. In Wischa
"u
itself, a pet"
"ty German town, "
Rostóv saw the 
Emperor again. I
n the market pl
"ace, where there"
 had been some r
ather heavy firi
ng before the E
mperor’s arriv
"al, lay several "
killed and wound
ed soldiers whom
 there had not 
been time to mov
"e. The Emperor, "
surrounded by hi
s suite of offi
cers and courtie
"rs, was riding a"
 bobtailed chest
"nut mare, a
dif"
ferent one from 
that which he ha
d ridden at the 
"review, and bend"
ing to one side
 he gracefully h
eld a gold lorgn
ette to his eyes
 and looked at 
a soldier who la
"y prone, with bl"
ood on his uncov
ered head. The 
wounded soldier 
"was so dirty, co"
"arse, and revolt"
ing that his pro
ximity to the E
mperor shocked R
ostóv. Rostóv 
saw how the Empe
ror’s rather 
round shoulders 
shuddered as if 
a cold shiver ha
"d run down them,"
 how his left f
oot began convul
sively tapping t
he horse’s sid
"e with the spur,"
 and how the we
ll-trained horse
 looked round un
concerned and di
d not stir. An 
"adjutant, dismou"
"nting, lifted th"
e soldier under 
the arms to pla
ce him on a stre
tcher that had b
een brought. The
 soldier groaned
".

“Gently, "
gently! Can’t 
you do it more g
ently?” said t
he Emperor appa
rently suffering
 more than the d
"ying soldier, an"
d he rode away. 
  Rostóv saw t
ears filling the
 Emperor’s eye
"s and heard him,"
 as he was ridi
"ng away, say to "
Czartorýski: �
�What a terrible
 thing war is: w
hat a terrible 
thing! Quelle te
rrible chose que
 la guerre!” 
 The troops of 
the vanguard wer
e stationed befo
"re Wischau, with"
in sight of the
 enemy’s lines
", which all day "
long had yielded
 ground to us a
t the least firi
ng. The Emperor�
��s gratitude wa
s announced to t
"he
vanguard, re"
wards were promi
"sed, and the men"
 received a doub
le ration of vo
dka. The campfir
es crackled and 
the soldiers’ 
songs resounded 
 even more merri
ly than on the p
revious night. D
enísov celebrat
ed his promotio
n to the rank of
" major, and Rost"
"óv, who had alr"
eady drunk enou
"gh, at the end o"
f the feast prop
osed the Emperor

Not ‘our Sove

said"
" he, “but the "

but that is how 
"I feel, and
so "
do you too! To t

xander the First

“Hurrah!” ra
ng the enthusias
tic voices of th
e officers.  A
nd the old caval
"ry captain, Kír"
"sten, shouted en"
thusiastically a
nd no less sinc
erely than the t
wenty-year-old R
ostóv.  When 
the officers had
 emptied and sma
shed their glass
"es, Kírsten fil"
"led
others and,"
 in shirt sleeve
"s and breeches, "
went glass in ha
nd to the soldi

and with his lon
"g gray mustache,"
 his white chest
 showing under 
"his open shirt, "
he stood in a ma
jestic pose in t
he light of the
" campfire, wavin"
g his uplifted a
rm.  “Lads! 
here’s to our 
"Sovereign, the E"
"mperor, and vict"

� he exclaimed i
"n his dashing, o"
"ld, hussar’s
"
baritone.  The
 hussars crowded
 round and respo
nded heartily wi
th loud shouts. 
  Late that nig
"ht, when all had"
" separated, Den�"

" his favorite, R"
"ostóv, on the s"
houlder.  “A

 said.  “Den

 “It is such a

"

“No, you d"

tóv got up and 
went wandering a
mong the campfir

 what happiness 
it would be to d
ie—not in savi
ng the Emperor�
�s life (he did
 not even dare t
o dream of that)
", but simply to "
die before his 
eyes. He really 
was in love with
 the Tsar and th
e glory of the R
ussian arms and
 the hope of fut
ure triumph. And
 he was not the 
only man to exp
erience that fee
ling during thos
e memorable days

APTER XI  The

d him reported. 
The cause of thi
s indisposition
 was the strong 
impression made 
on his sensitive
 mind by the si
ght of the kille
d and wounded. 
 At daybreak on
 the seventeenth
", a French offic"
er who had come 
with a flag of 
"truce, demanding"
 an audience wit
h the Russian Em
"peror, was
brou"
ght into Wischau
 from our outpos
ts. This officer
 was Savary. The
 Emperor had on
ly just fallen a
sleep and so Sav
ary had to wait.
 At midday he w
as admitted to t
"he Emperor, and "
an hour later he
 rode off with 
Prince Dolgorúk
ov to the advanc
ed post of the F
rench army.  I
t was rumored th
at Savary had be
en sent to propo
se to Alexander 
 a meeting with 
Napoleon. To the
 joy and pride o
f the whole army
", a
personal in"
terview was refu
"sed, and instead"
 of the Sovereig
"n, Prince
Dolgo"
"rúkov, the vict"
"or at Wischau, w"
as sent with Sav
ary to negotiate
 with Napoleon 
"if, contrary to "
"expectations, th"
ese negotiations
 were actuated 
by a real desire
 for peace.  T
oward evening Do
lgorúkov came b
"ack, went straig"
"ht to the Tsar, "
and remained al
one with him for
 a long time.  
 On the eighteen
th and nineteent
"h of November, t"
he army advanced
 two days’ ma
rch and the enem
y’s outposts a
fter a brief int
erchange of sho
ts retreated. In
 the highest arm
y circles from m
idday on the ni
"neteenth, a grea"
"t, excitedly bus"
tling activity b
egan which laste
d till the morn
ing of the twent
"ieth, when the m"
emorable battle 
of Austerlitz w
as fought.  Ti
ll midday on the
" nineteenth, the"
 activity—the 
"eager talk, runn"
"ing to
and fro,"
 and dispatching
 of adjutants—
was confined to 
the Emperor’s 
 headquarters. B
ut on the aftern
"oon of that day,"
 this activity r
eached Kutúzov
’s headquarter
s and the staffs
 of the commande
rs of columns. 
"By evening, the "
adjutants had sp
read it to all e
nds and parts of
" the
army, and "
in the night fro
m the nineteenth
 to the twentiet
"h, the whole
ei"
ghty thousand al
lied troops rose
 from their bivo
uacs to the hum 
"of
voices, and "
the army swayed 
and started in o
ne enormous mass
 six miles long
.  The concent
rated activity w
hich had begun a
t the Emperor’
s headquarters 
in the morning a
nd had started t
he whole movemen
t that followed
 was like the fi
rst movement of 
the main wheel o
f a large tower 
 clock. One whee
"l slowly moved, "
another was set 
"in motion, and a"
" third,
and whe"
els began to rev
olve faster and 
"faster, levers a"
nd cogwheels to 
"
work, chimes to"
" play, figures t"
"o pop out, and t"
he hands to adva
nce with regula
r motion as a re
sult of all that
 activity.  Ju
st as in the mec
hanism of a cloc
"k, so in the mec"
hanism of the mi
"litary
machine,"
 an impulse once
 given leads to 
the final result
; and just as i
ndifferently qui
escent till the 
moment when moti
on is transmitte
d to them are t
he parts of the 
mechanism which 
the impulse has 
not yet reached
. Wheels creak o
n their axles as
 the cogs engage
 one another and
 the revolving 
pulleys whirr wi
th the rapidity 
of their movemen
"t, but a
neighb"
oring wheel is a
s quiet and moti
onless as though
 it were prepare
d to remain so 
for a hundred ye
ars; but the mom
ent comes when t
he lever catche
s it and obeying
 the impulse tha
t wheel begins t
o creak and join
s in the common
 motion the resu
lt and aim of wh
ich are beyond i
ts ken.  Just 
"as in a clock, t"
he result of the
 complicated mot
ion of innumerab
le wheels and p
ulleys is merely
 a slow and regu
lar movement of 
the hands which
" show the time, "
so the result of
 all the complic
ated human acti
"vities of 160,00"
0 Russians and F
rench—all thei
"r passions, desi"
"res,
remorse, h"
"umiliations, suf"
"ferings, outburs"
"ts of pride, fea"
"r, and
enthusia"
sm—was only th
e loss of the ba
ttle of Austerli
"tz, the
so-call"
ed battle of the
 three Emperors�
��that is to say
", a slow movemen"
t of the hand o
n the dial of hu
man history.  
Prince Andrew wa
s on duty that d
ay and in consta
nt attendance on
 the commander 
in chief.  At 
six in the eveni
"ng, Kutúzov wen"
t to the Emperor
’s headquarter
s and after sta
ying but a short
 time with the T
sar went to see 
the grand marsh
"al of the court,"
 Count Tolstóy.
  Bolkónski t
ook the opportun
ity to go in to 
get some details
 of the coming 
action from Dolg
orúkov. He felt
 that Kutúzov w
as upset and di
ssatisfied about
 something and t
hat at headquart
ers they were d
issatisfied with
" him, and also t"
hat at the Emper
or’s headquart
ers everyone ad
opted toward him
 the tone of men
 who know someth
ing others do n
ot know: he ther
efore wished to 
speak to Dolgor�
�kov.  “Well
", how d’you do"
", my dear fellow"
?” said Dolgor
"úkov, who was
"
sitting at tea w
ith Bilíbin. �
�The fete is for
 tomorrow. How i
s your old fell
ow? Out of sorts
?”  “I won
’t say he is o
"ut of sorts, but"
 I fancy he woul
d like to be he
ard.”  “Bu
t they heard him
 at the council 
of war and will 
hear him when he
"
talks sense, b"
ut to temporize 
and wait for som
ething now when 
Bonaparte fears
 nothing so much
 as a general ba
ttle is impossib
le.”  “Yes
", you have seen "
him?” said Pri
nce Andrew. “W
"ell, what is
Bo"
naparte like? Ho
w did he impress
 you?”  “Y
"es, I saw him, a"
nd am convinced 
that he fears no
thing so much as
 a general enga
"gement,” repea"
"ted Dolgorúkov,"
 evidently prizi
ng this general
 conclusion whic
h he had arrived
 at from his int
erview with Nap
oleon. “If he 
weren’t afraid
 of a battle why
 did he ask for 
that interview?
" Why negotiate, "
and above all wh
"y retreat, when "
to retreat is s
o contrary to hi
s method of cond
ucting war? Beli
"eve me, he is af"
"raid,
afraid of"
 a general battl
e. His hour has 
come! Mark my wo
rds!”  “Bu
"t tell me, what "
"is he like, eh?�"
�� said Prince A
ndrew again.  
“He is a man i
n a gray overcoa
"t, very anxious "
that I should ca
ll him ‘Your 
"Majesty,’ but "
"who, to his chag"
"rin, got no titl"
e from me! That
’s the sort of
" man he is, and "
"nothing more,”"
 replied Dolgor
"úkov, looking r"
ound at Bilíbin
 with a smile. 
 “Despite my 
great respect fo
"r old Kutúzov,�"
"�� he continued,"
 “we should b
e a nice set of 
fellows if we we
re to wait about
 and so give him
 a chance to es
"cape, or to tric"
"k us, now that w"
e certainly have
 him in our han
"ds! No, we mustn"
’t forget Suv�
�rov and his rul
e—not to put 
yourself in a po
sition to be att
"acked, but yours"
elf to attack. B
elieve me in wa
r the energy of 
young men often 
shows the way be
tter than all t
he experience of
 old Cunctators.
”  “But in
 what position a
re we going to a
ttack him? I hav
e been at the o
utposts today an
d it is impossib
le to say where 
his chief forces
" are
situated,�"
�� said Prince A
ndrew.  He wis
hed to explain t
o Dolgorúkov a 
plan of attack h
e had himself f
"ormed.

“Oh,"
 that is all the
" same,” Dolgor"
úkov said quick
"ly, and getting "
up he spread a 
map on the table
. “All eventua
lities have been
 foreseen. If h
e is standing be
fore Brünn...�
�  And Prince 
Dolgorúkov rapi
dly but indistin
ctly explained W
eyrother’s pl
an of a flanking
 movement.  Pr
ince Andrew bega
n to reply and t
o state his own 
"plan, which migh"
t have been as 
good as Weyrothe
"r’s, but for t"
he disadvantage 
that Weyrother�
��s had already 
been approved. A
s soon as Prince
 Andrew began t
o demonstrate th
e defects of the
 latter and the 
merits of his ow
"n plan,
Prince "
Dolgorúkov ceas
ed to listen to 
him and gazed ab
sent-mindedly no
"t
at the map, b"
ut at Prince And
rew’s face.  
 “There will b
e a council of w
ar at Kutúzov�
"�s tonight, thou"
gh; you can say
" all this there,"
” remarked Dol
gorúkov.  “
"I will do so,”"
 said Prince And
"rew, moving away"
 from the map. 
 “Whatever ar
e you bothering 
"about, gentlemen"
?” said Bilíb
"in, who,
till t"
"hen, had listene"
d with an amused
 smile to their 
conversation and
 now was eviden
tly ready with a
 joke. “Whethe
r tomorrow bring
s victory or de
"feat, the glory "
of our Russian a
rms is secure. E
xcept your Kut�
"�zov, there is n"
ot a single Russ
ian in command o
f a column! The 
 commanders are:
 Herr General Wi
"mpfen, le Comte "
"de Langeron, le "
Prince de Licht
"enstein, le Prin"
"ce de Hohenlohe,"
 and finally Pri
"shprish, and so "
on like all tho
se Polish names.
”  “Be qui
"et, backbiter!�"
� said Dolgorúk
ov. “It is not
 true; there ar
e now two Russia
"ns, Milorádovic"
"h, and Dokhtúro"
"v, and there wou"
"ld be
a third, "
Count Arakchéev
", if his nerves "
were not too wea

aid Prince Andr
ew. “I wish yo
u good luck and 
"success, gentlem"
en!” he added 
and went out af
ter shaking hand
s with Dolgorúk
ov and Bilíbin.
  On the way h
"ome, Prince Andr"
ew could not ref
rain from asking
" Kutúzov,
who "
was sitting sile
"ntly beside him,"
 what he thought
 of tomorrow’s
 battle.  Kut
úzov looked ste
rnly at his adju
"tant and, after "
"a pause, replied"
: “I think th
e battle will be
" lost, and so I "
told Count Tolst
óy and asked h
im to tell the E
mperor. What do 
you think he rep
"lied? ‘But, my"
"
dear general, "
I am engaged wit
h rice and cutle
"ts, look after m"
ilitary matters
 yourself!’ Ye
s... That was th
e answer I got!�
��      CH
APTER XII  Sho
rtly after nine 
o’clock that e
"vening, Weyrothe"
r drove with his
 plans to Kutú
zov’s quarters
 where the counc
il of war was to
 be held. All t
he commanders of
 columns were su
mmoned to the co
mmander in chie
f’s and with t
he exception of 
Prince Bagratió
"n, who declined "
"to
come, were a"
ll there at the 
appointed time. 
"

Weyrother, wh"
o was in full co
ntrol of the pro
"posed battle, by"
 his eagerness 
and briskness pr
esented a marked
 contrast to the
 dissatisfied a
nd drowsy Kutúz
"ov, who reluctan"
tly played the p
art of chairman 
and president o
f the council of
 war. Weyrother 
evidently felt h
imself to be at
 the head of a m
ovement that had
 already become 
unrestrainable. 
He was like a h
orse running dow
nhill harnessed 
to a heavy cart.
 Whether he was 
 pulling it or b
eing pushed by i
t he did not kno
"w, but rushed al"
ong at headlong
 speed with no t
ime to consider 
what this moveme
nt might lead t
o. Weyrother had
 been twice that
 evening to the 
enemy’s picket
 line to reconn
oiter personally
", and twice to t"
"he Emperors, Rus"
sian and Austri
"an, to report an"
"d explain, and t"
o his headquarte
rs where he had 
 dictated the di
spositions in Ge
"rman, and now, m"
"uch exhausted, h"
e arrived at Ku
túzov’s.  H
e was evidently 
so busy that he 
even forgot to b
e polite to the 
 commander in ch
ief. He interrup
"ted him, talked "
rapidly and indi
"stinctly,
witho"
ut looking at th
e man he was add
"ressing, and did"
 not reply to q
uestions put to 
him. He was besp
attered with mud
 and had a pitif
"ul,
weary, and "
"distracted air, "
though at the sa
me time he was h
aughty and self
-confident.  K
utúzov was occu
pying a nobleman
’s castle of m
odest dimensions
 near Ostralitz
. In the large d
rawing room whic
h had become the
 commander in c
hief’s office 
were gathered Ku
"túzov himself, "
"Weyrother, and t"
he members of t
he council of wa
r. They were dri
"nking tea, and o"
nly awaited Pri
nce Bagratión t
o begin the coun
cil. At last Bag
ratión’s orde
rly came with t
he news that the
 prince could no
t attend. Prince
 Andrew came in
 to inform the c
ommander in chie
"f of this and, a"
vailing himself 
 of permission p
reviously given 
him by Kutúzov 
to be present at
" the
council, h"
e remained in th
e room.  “Si
nce Prince Bagra
tión is not com
"ing, we may begi"
"n,” said
Weyr"
"other, hurriedly"
 rising from his
 seat and going 
up to the table 
on which an eno
rmous map of the
 environs of Br�
�nn was spread o
"ut.

Kutúzov,"
 with his unifor
m unbuttoned so 
that his fat nec
k bulged over h
is collar as if 
"escaping, was si"
tting almost asl
eep in a low cha
"ir,
with his po"
dgy old hands re
sting symmetrica
lly on its arms.
 At the sound o
f Weyrother’s 
"voice, he opened"
 his one eye wit
h an effort.  
"“Yes, yes, if "
you please! It i
"s already late,�"
"�� said he, and "
nodding his hea
d he let it droo
p and again clos
ed his eye.  I
f at first the m
embers of the co
uncil thought th
at Kutúzov was 
 pretending to s
"leep, the sounds"
 his nose emitte
d during the rea
ding that follo
wed proved that 
the commander in
 chief at that m
oment was absorb
ed by a far mor
e serious matter
 than a desire t
o show his conte
mpt for the dis
positions or any
thing else—he 
was engaged in s
atisfying the i
rresistible huma
n need for sleep
. He really was 
asleep. Weyrothe
"r, with
the ges"
ture of a man to
o busy to lose a
" moment, glanced"
 at Kutúzov and
",
having convin"
ced himself that
" he was asleep, "
took up a paper 
"and in
a loud, "
monotonous voice
 began to read o
ut the dispositi
ons for the imp
"ending battle, u"
nder a heading w
hich he also rea
d out:  “Dis
positions for an
 attack on the e
nemy position be
hind Kobelnitz a
"nd
Sokolnitz, N"
"ovember 30, 1805"
.”  The disp
ositions were ve
ry complicated a
nd difficult. Th
ey began as fol
lows:  “As t
he enemy’s lef
t wing rests on 
wooded hills and
 his right exte
nds along Kobeln
itz and Sokolnit
z behind the pon
ds that are ther
"e,
while we, on"
" the other hand,"
 with our left w
ing by far outfl
"ank his
right, "
it is advantageo
us to attack the
 enemy’s latte
r wing especiall
y if we occupy 
the villages of 
Sokolnitz and Ko
"belnitz, whereby"
 we can both fa
ll on his flank 
and pursue him o
ver the plain be
tween Schlappan
itz and the Thue
"rassa forest, av"
oiding the defil
es of Schlappan
itz and Bellowit
z which cover th
e enemy’s fron
t. For this obj
ect it is necess
ary that... The 
first column mar
ches... The seco
nd column march
es... The third 
column marches..
".” and so on, "
read Weyrother.
  The generals
 seemed to liste
n reluctantly to
 the difficult d
ispositions. Th
"e tall, fair-hai"
red General Buxh
"öwden stood, le"
aning his back a
gainst the wall
", his eyes fixed"
 on a burning ca
"ndle, and seemed"
 not to listen 
or even to wish 
to be thought to
 listen. Exactly
 opposite Weyrot
"her,
with his g"
listening wide-o
pen eyes fixed u
pon him and his 
mustache twiste
"d upwards, sat t"
he ruddy Milorá
dovich in a mili
"tary pose, his
"
elbows turned ou
"twards, his hand"
"s on his knees, "
and his shoulder
s raised. He re
mained stubbornl
"y silent, gazing"
 at Weyrother’
"s face,
and onl"
y turned away hi
s eyes when the 
Austrian chief o
f staff finished
 reading. Then 
Milorádovich lo
oked round signi
ficantly at the 
other generals.
 But one could n
ot tell from tha
t significant lo
ok whether he a
greed or disagre
ed and was satis
fied or not with
 the arrangement
s. Next to Weyr
other sat Count 
"Langeron who, wi"
th a subtle smil
e that never lef
t his typically
 southern French
 face during the
 whole time of t
"he reading,
gaz"
ed at his delica
te fingers which
 rapidly twirled
 by its corners 
 a gold snuffbox
 on which was a 
portrait. In the
 middle of one o
f the longest s
"entences, he sto"
pped the rotary 
motion of the sn
"uffbox, raised
"
"his head, and wi"
th inimical poli
teness lurking i
n the corners of
 his thin lips 
interrupted Weyr
"other, wishing t"
o say something.
 But the Austri
"an general, cont"
"inuing to read, "
frowned angrily 
and jerked his 
"elbows, as if to"
 say: “You can
 tell me your vi
"ews later, but n"
ow be so good a
s to look at the
 map and listen.
” Langeron lif
ted his eyes wit
h an expression
" of perplexity, "
turned round to 
Milorádovich as
 if seeking an 
"explanation, but"
 meeting the lat
ter’s impressi
ve but meaningle
ss gaze drooped
 his eyes sadly 
and again took t
o twirling his s
nuffbox.  “A
 geography lesso
n!” he muttere
d as if to himse
"lf, but loud eno"
ugh to be heard
.  Przebyszéw
"ski, with respec"
tful but dignifi
"ed politeness, h"
eld his hand to
 his ear toward 
"Weyrother, with "
the air of a man
 absorbed in at
tention. Dohktú
"rov, a little ma"
"n, sat opposite "
"Weyrother, with"
 an assiduous an
"d modest mien, a"
nd stooping over
 the outspread m
ap conscientiou
sly studied the 
dispositions and
 the unfamiliar 
locality. He as
ked Weyrother se
veral times to r
epeat words he h
ad not clearly h
eard and the di
fficult names of
 villages. Weyro
ther complied an
d Dohktúrov no
ted them down. 
 When the readi
ng which lasted 
more than an hou
"r was over, Lang"
eron again brou
ght his snuffbox
" to rest and, wi"
thout looking at
 Weyrother or at
 anyone in part
"icular, began to"
 say how difficu
lt it was to car
ry out such a p
lan in which the
 enemy’s posit
ion was assumed 
"to be known,
wh"
ereas it was per
"haps not known, "
since the enemy 
was in movement.
 Langeron’s o
bjections were v
alid but it was 
obvious that the
ir chief aim wa
s to show Genera
l Weyrother—wh
o had read his d
ispositions with
 as much self-c
onfidence as if 
he were addressi
ng school childr
en—that he ha
"d to do, not wit"
"h fools, but wit"
h men who could 
teach him someth
ing in military
 matters.  Whe
n the monotonous
 sound of Weyrot
her’s voice ce
"ased, Kutúzov o"
pened his eye a
s a miller wakes
 up when the sop
orific drone of 
the mill wheel 
is interrupted. 
He listened to w
hat Langeron sai
"d, as if remarki"
"ng,
“So you a"
re still at that
 silly business!
” quickly clos
ed his eye agai
"n, and let his h"
ead sink still l
ower.  Langero
"n, trying as vir"
ulently as possi
ble to sting Wey
rother’s vanit
y as author of 
the military pla
"n, argued that B"
onaparte might e
asily attack in
stead of being a
"ttacked, and so "
render the whole
 of this plan p
erfectly worthle
ss. Weyrother me
t all objections
 with a firm and
 contemptuous s
"mile, evidently "
prepared beforeh
and to meet all 
objections be t
hey what they mi
ght.  “If he
 could attack us
", he would have "
"done so today,�"
� said he.  �
�So you think he
 is powerless?�
� said Langeron.
  “He has fo
rty thousand men
" at most,” rep"
"lied Weyrother, "
with the smile 
of a doctor to w
hom an old wife 
wishes to explai
n the treatment 
of a case.  �
��In that case h
e is inviting hi
s doom by awaiti
"ng our attack,�"
� said Langeron
", with a subtly "
"ironical smile, "
again glancing r
ound for support
 to Milorádovi
ch who was near 
him.  But Milo
rádovich was at
 that moment evi
dently thinking 
of anything rat
her than of what
 the generals we
re disputing abo
ut.  “Ma foi
"!” said he, �"
�tomorrow we sha
ll see all that 
on the battlefi
eld.”  Weyro
ther again gave 
that smile which
 seemed to say t
hat to him it wa
s strange and r
idiculous to mee
t objections fro
m Russian genera
ls and to have 
to prove to them
 what he had not
 merely convince
"d himself of, bu"
t had also conv
inced the sovere
ign Emperors of.
  “The enemy
 has quenched hi
s fires and a co
ntinual noise is
 heard from his
" camp,” said h"
e. “What does 
that mean? Eithe
r he is retreati
"ng,
which is th"
e only thing we 
"need fear, or he"
 is changing his
 position.” (
He smiled ironic
ally.) “But ev
en if he also to
ok up a position
 in the Thueras
"sa, he merely sa"
ves us a great d
eal of trouble a
nd all our arra
ngements to the 
minutest detail 
remain the same.
”  “How is
 that?...” beg
an Prince Andrew
", who had for lo"
ng been waiting 
 an opportunity 
to express his d
oubts.  Kutúz
"ov here woke up,"
 coughed heavily
", and looked rou"
nd at the gener
als.  “Gentl
"emen, the dispos"
itions for tomor
row—or rather 
"for today, for
"
it is past midni
ght—cannot now
" be altered,” "
said he. “You 
have heard them
", and we shall a"
ll do our duty. 
But before a bat
"tle, there is
n"
othing more impo
rtant...” he p
"aused, “than t"
o have a good sl
eep.”  He mo
ved as if to ris
e. The generals 
bowed and retire
d. It was past 
midnight. Prince
 Andrew went out
.  The council
" of war, at whic"
h Prince Andrew 
had not been abl
e to express hi
s opinion as he 
"had hoped to, le"
ft on him a vagu
e and uneasy im
pression. Whethe
r Dolgorúkov an
"d Weyrother, or "
"Kutúzov, Langer"
"on,
and the oth"
ers who did not 
approve of the p
"lan of attack, w"
ere right—he 
did not know. �
�But was it real
ly not possible 
for Kutúzov to
 state his views
 plainly to the 
Emperor? Is it p
ossible that on 
 account of cour
t and personal c
onsiderations te
ns of thousands 
"of lives,
and m"
"y life, my life,"
"” he thought, "
“must be riske
"d?”

“Yes,"
 it is very like
ly that I shall 
be killed tomorr
"ow,” he
thoug"
ht. And suddenly
", at this though"
"t of death, a wh"
ole series of mo
"st
distant, mos"
"t intimate, memo"
ries rose in his
 imagination: he
 remembered his
 last parting fr
om his father an
d his wife; he r
emembered the da
ys when he firs
t loved her. He 
thought of her p
regnancy and fel
t sorry for her
 and for himself
", and in a nervo"
usly emotional a
nd softened mood
 he went out of
 the hut in whic
h he was billete
d with Nesvítsk
i and began to 
walk up and down
 before it.  T
he night was fog
gy and through t
he fog the moonl
ight gleamed my
steriously. “Y
"es, tomorrow, to"
morrow!” he th
ought. “Tomorr
ow everything m
ay be over for m
e! All these mem
ories will be no
" more, none
of "
them will have a
ny meaning for m
e. Tomorrow perh
"aps, even certai"
"nly,
I have a p"
resentiment that
 for the first t
ime I shall have
 to show all I 
can do.” And h
is fancy picture
"d the battle, it"
"s loss, the
con"
centration of fi
ghting at one po
"int, and the hes"
itation of all t
he commanders. 
And then that ha
"ppy moment, that"
 Toulon for whic
h he had so lon
"g waited, presen"
ts itself to him
 at last. He fir
mly and clearly 
 expresses his o
pinion to Kutúz
"ov, to Weyrother"
", and to the Emp"
erors. All are 
struck by the ju
stness of his vi
"ews, but no one "
undertakes to c
"arry them out, s"
o he takes a reg
"iment, a divisio"
n—stipulates t
hat no one is t
o interfere with
 his arrangement
s—leads his di
vision to the d
"ecisive point, a"
nd gains the vic
tory alone. “B
ut death and su
ffering?” sugg
ested another vo
ice. Prince Andr
"ew, however, did"
 not answer tha
t voice and went
 on dreaming of 
his triumphs. Th
e dispositions 
for the next bat
tle are planned 
by him alone. No
minally he is on
ly an adjutant 
on Kutúzov’s 
"staff, but he do"
es everything al
one. The next b
attle is won by 
him alone. Kutú
zov is removed a
nd he is appoint
ed... “Well a
nd then?” aske
d the other voic
e. “If before 
that you are no
t ten times woun
"ded, killed, or "
"betrayed, well.."
. what then?...�
�� “Well then
",” Prince Andr"
ew answered hims
"elf, “I don’"
t know what wil

for that alone! 
I shall never te

oh God! what am
 I to do if I lo

t"
"hought, as he li"
stened to voices
 in Kutúzov’s
 courtyard. The 
voices were tho
se of the orderl

king up; one voi
"ce, probably a

"coachman’s, wa"
s teasing Kutúz
ov’s old cook 
whom Prince Andr

" “Tit, I say, "

the old man.  
"“Go, Tit, thre"

"�Oh, go to the d"

��      CH
APTER XIII  Th
"at same night, R"
ostóv was with 
a platoon on ski
rmishing duty in
 front of Bagra
tión’s detach
ment. His hussar
s were placed al
ong the line in
 couples and he 
himself rode alo
ng the line tryi
ng to master the
 sleepiness tha
t kept coming ov
er him. An enorm
"ous space, with "
our army’s ca
mpfires dimly gl
owing in the fog
", could be seen "
behind him; in 
front of him was
 misty darkness.
 Rostóv could s
"ee nothing, peer"
 as he would in
to that foggy di
stance: now some
thing gleamed gr
"ay, now there
w"
as something bla
"ck, now little l"
ights seemed to 
glimmer where th
e enemy ought t
"o be, now he fan"
cied it was only
 something in hi
s own eyes. His 
 eyes kept closi
"ng, and in his f"
ancy appeared—
"now the Emperor,"
" now
Denísov, "
and now Moscow m
emories—and he
 again hurriedly
 opened his eye
s and saw close 
before him the h
ead and ears of 
the horse he was
"
riding, and so"
"metimes, when he"
 came within six
" paces of them, "
the black figur
"es of hussars, b"
ut in the distan
ce was still the
 same misty dar
kness. “Why no
t?... It might e
"asily happen,”"
 thought Rostóv
",
“that the E"
mperor will meet
 me and give me 
an order as he w
ould to any oth
er officer; he�
�ll say: ‘Go a
nd find out what
’s there.’ T
here are many s
tories of his ge
tting to know an
 officer in just
 such a chance 
way and attachin
g him to himself
! What if he gav
e me a place nea
"r him?
Oh, how "
I would guard hi
"m, how I would t"
ell him the trut
"h, how I would
"
unmask his decei
vers!” And in 
order to realize
 vividly his lov
e devotion to t
"he sovereign, Ro"
stóv pictured t
o himself an ene
my or a deceitf
"ul German, whom "
he would not onl
y kill with plea
sure but whom h
e would slap in 
the face before 
the Emperor. Sud
denly a distant 
shout aroused h
im. He started a
nd opened his ey
es.  “Where 
"am I? Oh yes, in"
 the skirmishing
 line... pass an
d watchword—s
"haft, Olmütz. W"
hat a nuisance t
hat our squadron
 will be in res
"erve tomorrow,�"
� he thought. �
�I’ll ask leav
e to go to the f
"ront,
this may "
be my only chanc
e of seeing the 
Emperor. It won�
��t be long now
 before I am off
 duty. I’ll ta
ke another turn 
and when I get b
ack I’ll go t
o the general an
d ask him.” He
 readjusted hims
elf in the sadd
le and touched u
p his horse to r
ide once more ro
und his hussars.
 It seemed to h
im that it was g
etting lighter. 
To the left he s
aw a sloping de
"scent lit up, an"
d facing it a bl
ack knoll that s
eemed as steep a
s a wall. On th
is knoll there w
as a white patch
 that Rostóv co
uld not at all 
make out: was it
 a glade in the 
wood lit up by t
"he moon, or some"
"
unmelted snow,"
 or some white h
ouses? He even t
hought something
 moved on that 
white spot. “I
 expect it’s s
now... that spot
... a spot—une
"
tache,” he t"
hought. “There
 now... it’s n
ot a tache... Na
tásha... siste
"r, black eyes..."
 Na... tasha... 
(Won’t she be 
surprised when 
I tell her how I
’ve seen the E
mperor?) Natásh
a... take my sa
bretache...”�
�“Keep to the 
"right, your hono"
"r, there are bus"
"hes
here,” ca"
me the voice of 
"an hussar, past "
whom Rostóv was
 riding in the 
act of falling a
sleep. Rostóv l
ifted his head t
hat had sunk alm
ost to his hors
e’s mane and p
ulled up beside 
the hussar. He w
as succumbing t
"o irresistible, "
"youthful, childi"
sh drowsiness. �
��But what was I
 thinking? I mu
stn’t forget. 
How shall I spea
k to the Emperor
"? No,
that’s "
not it—that’
s tomorrow. Oh y
es! Natásha... 
sabretache... s
aber them... Who
m? The hussars..
". Ah, the hussar"
s with mustaches
. Along the Tve
rskáya Street r
ode the hussar w
ith mustaches...
 I thought about
"
him too, just "
opposite Gúryev
’s house... Ol
d Gúryev.... Oh
", but
Denísov�"
��s a fine fello
w. But that’s 
all nonsense. Th
e chief thing i
s that the Emper
or is here. How 
he looked at me 
and wished to sa
"y
something, bu"
t dared not.... 
"No, it was I who"
 dared not. But 
that’s nonsen
"se, the chief th"
ing is not to fo
rget the importa
nt thing I was 
thinking of. Yes
", Na-tásha, sab"
"retache, oh, yes"
", yes! That’s"
 right!” And h
is head once mor
e sank to his ho
rse’s neck. Al
l at once it se
emed to him that
 he was being fi
red at. “What?
 What? What?... 
Cut them down! 
What?...” said
" Rostóv, waking"
 up. At the mome
nt he opened hi
s eyes he heard 
"in front of him,"
 where the enemy
" was, the long-d"
rawn shouts of 
thousands of voi
ces. His horse a
nd the horse of 
the hussar near
 him pricked the
ir ears at these
 shouts. Over th
"ere, where the
"
shouting came fr
"om, a fire flare"
d up and went ou
"t again, then an"
"other,
and all "
along the French
 line on the hil
l fires flared u
p and the shout
ing grew louder 
and louder. Rost
óv could hear t
he sound of Fren
ch words but co
uld not distingu
ish them. The di
n of many voices
 was too great;
 all he could he
ar was: “ahaha
h!” and “rrr
r!”  “What
’s that? What 
do you make of i
t?” said Rost�
�v to the hussar
 beside him. �
�That must be th
e enemy’s camp
!”  The huss
ar did not reply
".

“Why, don"
’t you hear it
?” Rostóv ask
"ed again, after "
waiting for a r
eply.  “Who 
"can tell, your h"
onor?” replied
 the hussar relu
ctantly.  “F
rom the directio
"n, it must be th"
"e enemy,” repe"
ated Rostóv.  
 “It may be he
 or it may be no
"thing,” mutter"
ed the hussar. �
��It’s dark..
. Steady!” he 
cried to his fid
geting horse.  
 Rostóv’s hor
se was also gett
ing restive: it 
pawed the frozen
" ground,
pricki"
ng its ears at t
he noise and loo
king at the ligh
ts. The shouting
 grew still lou
der and merged i
nto a general ro
ar that only an 
army of several
 thousand men co
uld produce. The
 lights spread f
arther and fart
"her, probably al"
ong the line of 
the French camp.
 Rostóv no long
er wanted to sl
eep. The gay tri
umphant shouting
 of the enemy ar
my had a stimul
ating effect on 
him. “Vive l�
�Empereur! l’E
mpereur!” he n
ow heard distin
ctly.  “They
 can’t be far 
"off, probably ju"
st beyond the st
"ream,” he said"
 to the hussar 
beside him.  T
he hussar only s
ighed without re
plying and cough
ed angrily. The 
sound of horse�
��s hoofs approa
ching at a trot 
along the line o
f hussars was h
"eard, and out of"
 the foggy darkn
ess the figure o
f a sergeant of 
hussars suddenl
"y appeared, loom"
ing huge as an e
lephant.  “Y
"our honor, the g"
enerals!” said
" the sergeant, r"
iding up to Rost
"óv.

Rostóv,"
 still looking r
ound toward the 
fires and the sh
"outs, rode with"
 the sergeant to
 meet some mount
ed men who were 
riding along the
 line. One was 
on a white horse
. Prince Bagrati
ón and Prince D
olgorúkov with 
 their adjutants
 had come to wit
ness the curious
 phenomenon of t
he lights and s
houts in the ene
my’s camp. Ros
tóv rode up to 
"Bagratión,
rep"
"orted to him, an"
d then joined th
e adjutants list
ening to what th
e generals were
 saying.  “B
"elieve me,” sa"
id Prince Dolgor
"úkov, addressin"
"g Bagratión, �"
�it is nothing 
but a trick! He 
has retreated an
d ordered the re
arguard to kind
le fires and mak
e a noise to dec
eive us.”  �
"��Hardly,” sai"
d Bagratión. �
�I saw them this
 evening on that
 knoll; if they
 had retreated t
hey would have w
ithdrawn from th
at too.... Offi
cer!” said Bag
ratión to Rost�
"�v, “are the e"
nemy’s skirmis
hers still ther
e?”  “They
 were there this
" evening, but no"
w I don’t know
", your
excellen"
cy. Shall I go w
ith some of my h
ussars to see?�
� replied Rost�
�v.  Bagratió
"n stopped and, b"
"efore replying, "
tried to see Ros
tóv’s face i
n the mist.  �
"��Well, go and s"
"ee,” he said, "
after a pause. 
"
“Yes, sir.�"
�  Rostóv spu
"rred his horse, "
called to Sergea
nt Fédchenko an
d two other hus
"sars, told them "
"to follow him, a"
nd trotted downh
ill in the direc
tion from which
 the shouting ca
me. He felt both
 frightened and 
pleased to be r
iding alone with
 three hussars i
nto that mysteri
ous and dangerou
s misty distanc
e where no one h
ad been before h
im. Bagratión c
alled to him fro
m the hill not 
to go beyond the
" stream, but Ros"
tóv pretended n
ot to hear him 
and did not stop
 but rode on and
" on, continually"
 mistaking bushe
s for trees and
 gullies for men
 and continually
 discovering his
 mistakes. Havi
ng descended the
" hill at a trot,"
 he no longer sa
w either our own
 or the enemy�
"�s fires, but he"
ard the shouting
 of the French m
ore loudly and 
distinctly. In t
he valley he saw
 before him some
thing like a riv
"er,
but when he"
 reached it he f
ound it was a ro
ad. Having come 
out onto the ro
ad he reined in 
"his horse, hesit"
ating whether to
 ride along it o
r cross it and 
ride over the bl
ack field up the
 hillside. To ke
ep to the road 
which gleamed wh
ite in the mist 
would have been 
safer because it
 would be easie
r to see people 
coming along it.
 “Follow me!�
"� said he,
cros"
"sed the road, an"
d began riding u
p the hill at a 
gallop toward th
e point where t
he French picket
s had been stand
ing that evening
.  “Your hon
"or, there he is!"
” cried one of
 the hussars beh
ind him. And be
fore Rostóv had
 time to make ou
t what the black
 thing was that 
had suddenly ap
peared in the fo
"g, there was a f"
"lash, followed b"
"y a report,
and"
 a bullet whizzi
ng high up in th
e mist with a pl
aintive sound pa
ssed out of hea
ring. Another mu
sket missed fire
 but flashed in 
the pan. Rostó
v turned his hor
se and galloped 
back. Four more 
reports followed
"
at intervals, "
and the bullets 
passed somewhere
 in the fog sing
ing in differen
t tones. Rostóv
 reined in his h
"orse, whose spir"
"its had risen,
"
"like his own, at"
" the firing, and"
 went back at a 
footpace. “Wel
"l, some
more! S"
ome more!” a m
erry voice was s
aying in his sou
l. But no more 
shots came.  O
nly when approac
hing Bagratión 
did Rostóv let 
his horse gallop
" again,
and wit"
h his hand at th
e salute rode up
 to the general.
  Dolgorúkov 
was still insist
ing that the Fre
nch had retreate
d and had only 
lit fires to dec
eive us.  “W
hat does that pr
ove?” he was s
aying as Rostóv
 rode up. “The
y might retreat
 and leave the p
ickets.”  �
�It’s plain th
at they have not

Bagratión. “W

“Very good, "

id Bagratión. �
"��Thank you, off"

 “Tomorrow ou

  The fires an
d shouting in th
e enemy’s army
 were occasioned
 by the fact th
at while Napoleo

the Emperor him
self rode round 
his bivouacs. Th
"e soldiers, on s"

wisps of straw a

was as follows:

LEON     CH
APTER XIV  At 
five in the morn
ing it was still
 quite dark. The
 troops of the 
"center, the rese"
"rves, and Bagrat"
ión’s right f
lank had not yet
" moved,
but on "
the left flank t
he columns of in
"fantry, cavalry,"
" and artillery,"
 which were to b
e the first to d
escend the heigh
ts to attack the
 French right f
lank and drive i
t into the Bohem
ian mountains ac
"cording to plan,"
 were already u
p and astir. The
 smoke of the ca
"mpfires, into wh"
ich they were t
hrowing everythi
"ng superfluous, "
made the eyes sm
art. It was cold
 and dark. The 
officers were hu
rriedly drinking
 tea and breakfa
"sting, the
sold"
"iers, munching b"
iscuit and beati
ng a tattoo with
 their feet to 
"warm themselves,"
 gathering round
 the fires throw
ing into the fla
mes the remains
" of sheds, chair"
"s, tables, wheel"
"s, tubs, and eve"
rything that the
y did not want 
or could not car
ry away with the
m. Austrian colu
mn guides were 
moving in and ou
t among the Russ
ian troops and s
erved as heralds
 of the advance
. As soon as an 
Austrian officer
 showed himself 
near a commandi
ng officer’s q
"uarters, the reg"
iment began to m
ove: the soldie
rs ran from the 
"fires, thrust th"
eir pipes into t
"heir boots, thei"
r bags into the
" carts, got thei"
"r muskets ready,"
 and formed rank
. The officers 
buttoned up thei
"r coats, buckled"
 on their swords
" and pouches,
a"
nd moved along t
he ranks shoutin
g. The train dri
vers and orderli
es harnessed an
d packed the wag
ons and tied on 
the loads. The a
djutants and ba
ttalion and regi
mental commander
"s mounted, cross"
"ed themselves, g"
ave final instr
"uctions, orders,"
 and commissions
 to the baggage 
men who remaine

e monotonous tra

of feet resound
ed. The column m

"
from the masses 
"around them, the"
 smoke and the i
"ncreasing fog, t"
o see either th
e place they wer

were going.  A
 soldier on the 
march is hemmed 
in and borne alo
ng by his regime
nt as much as a
 sailor is by hi
s ship. However 
far he has walke
"d, whatever
str"
"ange, unknown, a"

just as a sailor
 is always surr

s of their regi

"n intently, look"
" about, and eage"
rly ask concerni
ng what is goin

.  The fog had
 grown so dense 
that though it w
as growing light
 they could not
 see ten paces a
head. Bushes loo

 ten paces off. 
But the columns 
advanced for a 
"long time, alway"
s in the same fo

d ascending hill
"s,
avoiding gar"
dens and enclosu

new and unknown

g the enemy. On 
"the contrary, th"
e soldiers becam
e aware that in

and on all sides
", other Russian "
columns were mo
ving in the same
 direction. Ever
y soldier felt g
lad to know that
 to the unknown
 place where he 
"was going, many "
more of our men 
were going too.
  “There now
", the Kúrskies "
have also gone p
"ast,” was bein"
g said in the r
anks.  “It�
�s wonderful wha
t a lot of our t
roops have gathe

pecially to an

 they had marche

our in the dense
" fog,
the great"
er part of the m
en had to halt a
nd an unpleasant
 consciousness 
of some dislocat

 but it certain
ly is communicat
"ed very surely, "
and flows rapidl
"y, imperceptibly"
",
and irrepress"

Had the Russian

a long time befo

r was readily an
d naturally attr
ibuted to the st

Germans, a"
nd everyone was 
convinced that a
 dangerous muddl
e had been occa
sioned by the sa
usage eaters.  
 “Why have we 
stopped? Is the 
way blocked? Or 
have we already 
come up against
 the French?” 
"

“No, one ca"
n’t hear them.
 They’d be fir

�  “They wer

"
“Yes, I’d "

“I say,"

officer.  “A

 said another. 
  “What divis

shouted an adjut

  “The Eighte

��  “We were
 ordered to be a
t the place befo
"re nine, but we "
haven’t got h
alfway. Fine ord
ers!” was bein
g repeated on di
fferent sides. 
 And the feelin
g of energy with
 which the troop
s had started be
gan to turn int
o vexation and a
nger at the stup
id arrangements 
and at the Germ
ans.  The caus
e of the confusi
on was that whil
e the Austrian c
avalry was movi
ng toward our le
"ft flank, the hi"
gher command fou
nd that our cent
er was too far 
separated from o
ur right flank a
nd the cavalry w
ere all ordered
 to turn back to
 the right. Seve
ral thousand cav
alry crossed in 
 front of the in
"fantry, who had "
to wait.  At t
he front an alte
rcation occurred
 between an Aust
rian guide and a
 Russian genera
l. The general s
houted a demand 
that the cavalry
 should be halt
"ed, the Austrian"
 argued that not
" he, but the hig"
"her command, was"
 to blame. The 
troops meanwhile
 stood growing l
istless and disp
irited. After a
n hour’s delay
 they at last mo
"ved on, descendi"
ng the hill. The
 fog that was d
ispersing on the
 hill lay still 
more densely bel
"ow, where they
"
were descending.
 In front in the
 fog a shot was 
heard and then a
"nother,
at firs"
t irregularly at
 varying interva
ls—trata...tat
—and then more
 and more regul
arly and rapidly
", and the action"
 at the Goldbach
 Stream began. 
  Not expecting
 to come on the 
enemy down by th
"e stream, and ha"
ving stumbled o
n him in the fog
", hearing no enc"
ouraging word fr
om their comman
"ders, and with a"
 consciousness o
f being too late
 spreading throu
"gh
the ranks, a"
nd above all bei
ng unable to see
 anything in fro
nt or around th
em in the thick 
"fog, the Russian"
s exchanged shot
s with the enemy
 lazily and adv
anced and again 
"halted, receivin"
g no timely orde
rs from the off
icers or adjutan
ts who wandered 
about in the fog
 in those unknow
n surroundings 
unable to find t
heir own regimen
ts. In this way 
the action bega
"n for the first,"
" second, and thi"
"rd columns, whic"
h had gone down 
into the valley
. The fourth col
"umn, with which "
"Kutúzov was, st"
ood on the Prat
zen Heights.  
"Below, where the"
 fight was begin
"ning, there was "
still thick fog;
 on the higher 
ground it was cl
"earing, but noth"
ing could be see
n of what was g
oing on in front
. Whether all th
e enemy forces w
"ere, as we suppo"
"sed,
six miles "
"away, or whether"
 they were near 
by in that sea o
"f mist, no one
"
knew till after 
eight o’clock.
  It was nine 
o’clock in the
 morning. The fo
g lay unbroken l
ike a sea down 
"below, but highe"
r up at the vill
age of Schlappan
itz where Napole
on stood with h
is marshals arou
"nd him, it was q"
uite light. Abov
e him was a cle
"ar blue sky, and"
 the sun’s vas
t orb quivered l
ike a huge hollo
"w,
crimson floa"
t on the surface
 of that milky s
ea of mist. The 
whole French ar
"my, and even Nap"
oleon himself wi
"th his staff, we"
re not on the fa
r side of the s
treams and hollo
ws of Sokolnitz 
and Schlappanitz
 beyond which we
 intended to ta
ke up our positi
on and begin the
" action, but wer"
"e on this
side,"
 so close to our
 own forces that
 Napoleon with t
he naked eye cou
ld distinguish 
a mounted man fr
om one on foot. 
"Napoleon, in the"
 blue cloak whi
ch he had worn o
n his Italian ca
"mpaign, sat on h"
is small gray Ar
ab horse a litt
le in front of h
is marshals. He 
gazed silently a
t the hills whi
ch seemed to ris
e out of the sea
 of mist and on 
which the Russia
n troops were m
oving in the dis
"tance, and he li"
stened to the so
unds of firing 
in the valley. N
ot a single musc
le of his face�
�which in those 
 days was still 
thin—moved. Hi
s gleaming eyes 
were fixed inten
tly on one spot
. His prediction
s were being jus
tified. Part of 
the Russian for
ce had already d
escended into th
e valley toward 
the ponds and la
kes and part we
re leaving these
 Pratzen Heights
 which he intend
ed to attack an
d regarded as th
e key to the pos
ition. He saw ov
er the mist that
 in a hollow be
tween two hills 
near the village
" of Pratzen, the"
 Russian column
"s, their bayonet"
"s glittering, we"
re moving contin
uously in one d
irection toward 
the valley and d
isappearing one 
after another in
to the mist. Fr
om information h
e had received t
he evening befor
"e, from the
sou"
nd of wheels and
 footsteps heard
 by the outposts
 during the nigh
"t,
by the disor"
derly movement o
f the Russian co
"lumns, and from "
all indications
", he saw clearly"
 that the allies
 believed him to
 be far away in
" front of them, "
and that the col
umns moving near
 Pratzen constit
uted the center
 of the Russian 
"army, and that t"
hat center was a
lready sufficie
ntly weakened to
 be successfully
 attacked. But s
till he did not 
 begin the engag
ement.  Today 
was a great day 
for him—the an
niversary of his
 coronation. Be
fore dawn he had
 slept for a few
" hours, and refr"
"eshed, vigorous,"
 and in good sp
"irits, he mounte"
d his horse and 
rode out into th
e field in that
 happy mood in w
hich everything 
seems possible a
nd everything s
ucceeds. He sat 
"motionless, look"
ing at the heigh
ts visible above
"
the mist, and "
his cold face wo
re that special 
look of confiden
"t,
self-complac"
ent happiness th
at one sees on t
he face of a boy
 happily in lov
e. The marshals 
stood behind him
 not venturing t
o distract his 
attention. He lo
oked now at the 
"Pratzen Heights,"
 now at the sun 
floating up out
 of the mist.  
 When the sun ha
d entirely emerg
"ed from the fog,"
 and fields and 
mist were aglow
 with dazzling l
ight—as if he 
had only awaited
 this to begin t
he action—he 
drew the glove f
rom his shapely 
"white hand, made"
 a sign with it
 to the marshals
", and ordered th"
e action to begi
"n. The marshals,"
 accompanied by
" adjutants, gall"
oped off in diff
erent directions
", and
a few min"
utes later the c
hief forces of t
he French army m
oved rapidly to
ward those Pratz
en Heights which
 were being more
 and more denude
d by Russian tr
oops moving down
 the valley to t
heir left.   
   CHAPTER XV
  At eight o�
�clock Kutúzov 
rode to Pratzen 
at the head of t
he fourth colum
"n, Milorádovich"
"’s, the one th"
at was to take t
he place of Prz
ebyszéwski’s 
and Langeron’s
 columns which h
ad already gone 
down into the v
alley. He greete
d the men of the
 foremost regime
nt and gave the
m the order to m
"arch, thereby in"
dicating that he
 intended to lea
d that column h
imself. When he 
had reached the 
village of Pratz
en he halted. P
rince Andrew was
" behind, among t"
he immense numbe
r forming the c
ommander in chie
f’s suite. He 
was in a state o
f suppressed exc
itement and irr
"itation, though "
controlledly cal
m as a man is at
 the approach of
 a long-awaited
 moment. He was 
firmly convinced
 that this was t
he day of his T
"oulon, or his br"
idge of Arcola. 
How it would com
e about he did n
"ot
know, but he"
 felt sure it wo
uld do so. The l
ocality and the 
position of our
 troops were kno
wn to him as far
 as they could b
e known to anyon
e in our army. 
His own strategi
"c plan, which ob"
viously could no
t now be carrie
"d out, was forgo"
"tten. Now, enter"
ing into Weyroth
"er’s plan,
Pr"
ince Andrew cons
idered possible 
contingencies an
d formed new pro
jects such as m
ight call for hi
s rapidity of pe
rception and dec
ision.  To the
 left down below
" in the mist, th"
e musketry fire 
of unseen forces
 could be heard
. It was there P
rince Andrew tho
ught the fight w
ould concentrat
e. “There we s
hall encounter d
"ifficulties, and"
" there,”
thou"
"ght he, “I sha"
ll be sent with 
a brigade or div
"ision, and there"
",
standard in h"
"and, I shall go "
forward and brea
k whatever is in
 front of me.�
�  He could no
t look calmly at
 the standards o
f the passing ba
ttalions. Seein
g them he kept t
"hinking, “That"
 may be the very
 standard with 
which I shall le
ad the army.” 
  In the mornin
g all that was l
eft of the night
 mist on the hei
ghts was a hoar
 frost now turni
"ng to dew, but i"
n the valleys it
 still lay like 
a milk-white se
a. Nothing was v
isible in the va
lley to the left
 into which our
 troops had desc
ended and from w
hence came the s
ounds of firing.
 Above the heig
hts was the dark
" clear sky, and "
to the right the
 vast orb of th
"e sun. In front,"
 far off on the 
farther shore of
 that sea of mis
"t,
some wooded "
hills were disce
"rnible, and it w"
as there the ene
my probably was
", for something "
could be descrie
d. On the right 
the Guards were 
 entering the mi
sty region with 
a sound of hoofs
 and wheels and 
now and then a 
gleam of bayonet
s; to the left b
eyond the villag
e similar masses
 of cavalry cam
e up and disappe
ared in the sea 
of mist. In fron
t and behind mo
ved infantry. Th
e commander in c
hief was standin
g at the end of 
 the village let
ting the troops 
pass by him. Tha
t morning Kutúz
ov seemed worn 
and irritable. T
he infantry pass
ing before him c
ame to a halt w
ithout any comma
"nd being given, "
apparently obstr
ucted by somethi
ng in front.  
 “Do order the
m to form into b
attalion columns
 and go round th
e village!” h
e said angrily t
o a general who 
had ridden up. �
��Don’t you u
"nderstand, your "
"excellency, my d"
"ear sir, that yo"
u must not defi
le through narro
w village street
s when we are ma
rching against t
he enemy?”  
 “I intended t
o re-form them b
eyond the villag
"e, your excellen"
"cy,”
answered"
 the general.  
 Kutúzov laughe
d bitterly.  �
��You’ll make 
a fine thing of 
"it, deploying in"
 sight of the en
emy! Very fine!
”  “The en
emy is still far
" away, your exce"
llency. Accordin
g to the dispos
itions...”  
“The dispositi
ons!” exclaime
d Kutúzov bitte
rly. “Who told
 you that?... K
indly do as you 
are ordered.” 
"

“Yes, sir.�"
��  “My dear
" fellow,” Nesv"
ítski whispered
 to Prince Andre
"w, “the old
m"
an is as surly a
s a dog.”  A
n Austrian offic
er in a white un
iform with green
 plumes in his h
at galloped up 
to Kutúzov and 
asked in the Emp
eror’s name ha
d the fourth co
lumn advanced in
to action.  Ku
túzov turned ro
und without answ
ering and his ey
e happened to fa
ll upon Prince 
"Andrew, who was "
beside him. Seei
"ng him, Kutúzov"
’s malevolent
 and caustic exp
ression softened
", as if admittin"
g that what was
 being done was 
not his adjutant
"’s fault, and "
still not answer
ing the Austria
"n adjutant, he a"
ddressed Bolkón
"ski.

“Go, m"
"y dear fellow, a"
nd see whether t
he third divisio
n has passed the
 village. Tell 
it to stop and a
wait my orders.�
��  Hardly had
 Prince Andrew s
tarted than he s
topped him.  �
��And ask whethe
r sharpshooters 
have been posted
",” he added. �"
��What are they
 doing? What are
 they doing?” 
he murmured to h
"imself, still
n"
ot replying to t
he Austrian.  
Prince Andrew ga
lloped off to ex
ecute the order.
  Overtaking t
he battalions th
at continued to 
"advance, he stop"
ped the third d
ivision and conv
inced himself th
at there really 
were no sharpsh
ooters in front 
of our columns. 
The colonel at t
he head of the 
regiment was muc
h surprised at t
he commander in 
chief’s order 
to throw out sk
irmishers. He ha
d felt perfectly
 sure that there
 were other troo
ps in front of 
him and that the
 enemy must be a
t least six mile
s away. There w
as really nothin
g to be seen in 
front except a b
arren descent h
idden by dense m
ist. Having give
n orders in the 
commander in chi
ef’s name to 
rectify this omi
"ssion, Prince An"
drew galloped ba
ck. Kutúzov st
ill in the same 
"place, his stout"
 body resting he
avily in the sad
dle with the la
"ssitude of age, "
sat yawning wear
ily with closed 
eyes. The troop
s were no longer
" moving, but sto"
od with the butt
s of their muske
ts on the groun
d.  “All rig
"ht, all right!�"
� he said to Pri
"nce Andrew, and "
turned to a gen
"eral who, watch "
"in hand, was say"
ing it was time 
they started as 
all the left-fl
ank columns had 
already descende
d.  “Plenty 
"of time, your ex"
"cellency,” mut"
tered Kutúzov i
n the midst of 
a yawn. “Plent
"y of time,” he"
 repeated.  Ju
st then at a dis
tance behind Kut
úzov was heard 
the sound of reg
iments saluting
", and this sound"
 rapidly came ne
arer along the w
hole extended l
ine of the advan
cing Russian col
umns. Evidently 
the person they 
were greeting w
as riding quickl
y. When the sold
iers of the regi
ment in front o
f which Kutúzov
 was standing be
"gan to shout, he"
 rode a little t
o one side and 
looked round wit
h a frown. Along
 the road from P
ratzen galloped 
 what looked lik
e a squadron of 
horsemen in vari
ous uniforms. Tw
o of them rode 
side by side in 
"front, at full g"
allop. One in a 
black uniform wi
th white plumes
 in his hat rode
 a bobtailed che
"stnut horse, the"
 other who was 
in a white unifo
rm rode a black 
one. These were 
the two Emperors
 followed by th
eir suites. Kut�
"�zov, affecting "
the manners of a
n old soldier a
"t the front, gav"
e the command �
�Attention!” a
nd rode up to t
he Emperors with
 a salute. His w
hole appearance 
and manner were 
 suddenly transf
ormed. He put on
 the air of a su
bordinate who ob
eys without rea
soning. With an 
affectation of r
espect which evi
dently struck A
lexander unpleas
"antly, he rode u"
p and saluted. 
 This unpleasan
t impression mer
ely flitted over
 the young and h
appy face of th
e Emperor like a
 cloud of haze a
cross a clear sk
y and vanished. 
 After his illne
ss he looked rat
her thinner that
 day than on the
 field of Olmü
tz where Bolkón
ski had seen him
 for the first t
"ime abroad, but"
 there was still
 the same bewitc
hing combination
 of majesty and 
mildness in his
" fine gray eyes,"
 and on his deli
cate lips the sa
me capacity for 
 varying express
ion and the same
 prevalent appea
rance of goodhea
rted innocent y
outh.  At the 
Olmütz review h
e had seemed mor
e majestic; here
 he seemed brig
hter and more en
ergetic. He was 
slightly flushed
 after galloping
" two
miles, and"
 reining in his 
horse he sighed 
restfully and lo
oked round at t
he faces of his 
"suite, young and"
 animated as his
 own. Czartorýs
"ki,
Novosíltse"
"v, Prince Volkó"
"nsky, Strógonov"
", and the others"
", all richly
dr"
essed gay young 
"men on splendid,"
" well-groomed, f"
"resh, only sligh"
tly heated hors
"es, exchanging r"
emarks and smili
"ng, had stopped "
behind the Empe
ror. The Emperor
" Francis, a rosy"
", long faced you"
"ng man, sat very"
 erect on his h
andsome black ho
"rse, looking abo"
ut him in a leis
urely and preoc
cupied manner. H
e beckoned to on
e of his white a
djutants and ask
ed some questio
n—“Most like
ly he is asking 
at what o’cloc
"k they
started,"
” thought Prin
"ce Andrew, watch"
ing his old acqu
aintance with a
 smile he could 
not repress as h
e recalled his r
eception at Brü
nn. In the Empe
rors’ suite we
re the picked yo
ung orderly offi
cers of the Gua
rd and line regi
"ments, Russian a"
nd Austrian. Amo
ng them were gro
oms leading the
 Tsar’s beauti
ful relay horses
 covered with em
broidered cloth
s.  As when a 
window is opened
 a whiff of fres
h air from the f
ields enters a 
"stuffy room, so "
a whiff of youth
"fulness, energy,"
 and confidence 
of success reac
hed Kutúzov’s
 cheerless staff
 with the gallop
ing advent of a
ll these brillia
nt young men.  
 “Why aren’t
" you beginning, "
Michael Ilarión
ovich?” said t
he Emperor Alex
ander hurriedly 
"to Kutúzov, gla"
ncing courteousl
y at the same t
ime at the Emper
or Francis.  �
"��I am waiting, "
"Your Majesty,”"
 answered Kutúz
"ov, bending forw"
ard respectfull
y.  The Empero
"r, frowning slig"
"htly, bent his e"
ar forward as if
 he had not qui
te heard.  “
"Waiting, Your Ma"
"jesty,” repeat"
ed Kutúzov. (Pr
ince Andrew note
d that Kutúzov
’s upper lip t
witched unnatura
lly as he said t
he word “wait
ing.”) “Not 
all the columns 
have formed up y
"et, Your

ously did not li

 shrugged his r
ather round shou

d at Novosíltse
v who was near h
"im, as

e was saying. Bu
t the Emperor F
rancis continued
 to look about h
im and did not l
isten.  “Tha
t is just why I 
"do not begin, si"

�zov in a resou

arently to precl

d—“That is j
ust why I do no

ecause we are no

not on the Empr
"ess’ Field,”"
 said he clearly
 and distinctly.
  In the Emper
or’s suite all
 exchanged rapid
 looks that expr
essed dissatisf
action and repro
ach. “Old thou
"gh he may be, he"
" should not, he"
 certainly shoul
"d not, speak lik"
"e that,” their"
 glances seemed 
to say.  The T
sar looked inten
tly and observan

v’s eye waiti
ng to hear wheth
er he would say 
anything more. B
"ut Kutúzov, wit"
h respectfully 
"bowed head, seem"

bout a minute. 
"
“However, if"
" you command it,"
" Your Majesty,�"
"� said Kutúzov,"
 lifting his he
ad and again ass
uming his former
" tone of a dull,"
" unreasoning, bu"
t submissive ge
neral.  He tou
ched his horse a
nd having called
" Milorádovich, "
the commander of
"
the column, ga"
ve him the order
 to advance.  
The troops again
" began to move, "
and two battalio
ns of the Nóvgo
rod and one of 
the Ápsheron re
giment went forw
ard past the Emp
eror.  As this
 Ápsheron batta
"lion marched by,"
 the red-faced M

"God be with you,"

"
“Ma foi, sir"

 Milorádovich w
heeled his horse
 sharply and sta

" Ápsheron men, "

passed in ste"

"
 “Lads!” sh

 “Glad to do o

 that had carri

     CHAPTER
 XVI  Kutúzov
 accompanied by 
his adjutants ro
de at a walking 
pace behind the 
 carabineers.  
 When he had gon
e less than half
 a mile in the r
ear of the colum
n he stopped at
" a solitary, des"
erted house that
 had probably on
"ce been an
inn,"
 where two roads
 parted. Both of
 them led downhi
ll and troops we
re marching alo
ng both.  The 
fog had begun to
 clear and enemy
 troops were alr
eady dimly visib
le about a mile
 and a half off 
on the opposite 
heights. Down be
"low, on
the lef"
"t, the firing be"
came more distin
ct. Kutúzov had
 stopped and was
 speaking to an
 Austrian genera
l. Prince Andrew
", who was a litt"
le behind looki
"ng at them, turn"
ed to an adjutan
t to ask him for
 a field glass. 
"

“Look, look"
!” said this a
"djutant, looking"
 not at the troo
ps in the dista
"nce, but down th"
e hill before hi
m. “It’s the
 French!”  T
he two generals 
and the adjutant
 took hold of th
"e field glass, t"
rying to snatch
 it from one ano
ther. The expres
sion on all thei
r faces suddenl
y changed to one
 of horror. The 
French were supp
osed to be a mi
le and a half aw
"ay, but had sudd"
enly and unexpec
tedly appeared j
ust in front of
 us.  “It’
s the enemy?... 
"No!... Yes, see "
it is!... for ce
rtain.... But h
ow is that?” s
aid different vo
ices.  With th
e naked eye Prin
ce Andrew saw be
low them to the 
"right, not more"
 than five hundr
ed paces from wh
ere Kutúzov was
" standing, a den"
se French colum
n coming up to m
eet the Ápshero
ns.  “Here i
t is! The decisi
ve moment has ar
rived. My turn h
"as come,”
tho"
ught Prince Andr
"ew, and striking"
 his horse he ro
de up to Kutúzo
v.  “The Áp
sherons must be 
"stopped, your ex"
"cellency,” cri"
ed he. But at t
hat very instant
 a cloud of smok
e spread all rou
"nd, firing was h"
eard quite clos
"e at hand, and a"
 voice of naïve
 terror barely t
wo steps from P
rince Andrew sho
"uted, “Brother"
s! All’s lost!
” And at this 
as if at a comm
"and, everyone be"
gan to run.  C
onfused and ever
-increasing crow
ds were running 
back to where fi
ve minutes befo
re the troops ha
d passed the Emp
erors. Not only 
would it have b
een difficult to
 stop that crowd
", it was even im"
possible not to 
 be carried back
 with it oneself
. Bolkónski onl
y tried not to l
ose touch with 
"it, and looked a"
round bewildered
 and unable to g
rasp what was h
appening in fron
t of him. Nesví
tski with an ang
"ry face, red and"
 unlike himself
", was shouting t"
o Kutúzov that 
if he did not ri
de away at once 
 he would certai
nly be taken pri
soner. Kutúzov 
remained in the 
same place and 
without answerin
g drew out a han
dkerchief. Blood
 was flowing fr
om his cheek. Pr
ince Andrew forc
ed his way to hi
m.  “You are
 wounded?” he 
"asked, hardly ab"
le to master the
 trembling of h
is lower jaw.  
 “The wound is
" not here, it is"
 there!” said 
"Kutúzov, pressi"
ng the handkerc
hief to his woun
ded cheek and po
inting to the fl
eeing soldiers. 
 “Stop them!�
"� he shouted, an"
d at the same mo
"ment, probably r"
ealizing that i
t was impossible
" to stop them, s"
purred his horse
 and rode to the
 right.  A fr
esh wave of the 
flying mob caugh
t him and bore h
im back with it.
  The troops w
ere running in s
uch a dense mass
 that once surro
unded by them i
t was difficult 
to get out again
. One was shouti
"ng, “Get on!
"
Why are you hind
ering us?” Ano
ther in the same
 place turned ro
und and fired i
n the air; a thi
rd was striking 
the horse Kutúz
ov himself rode.
 Having by a gr
eat effort got a
way to the left 
from that flood 
"of men,
Kutúzo"
"v, with his suit"
e diminished by 
"more than half, "
rode toward a s
ound of artiller
y fire near by. 
Having forced hi
s way out of the
 crowd of fugit
"ives, Prince And"
"rew, trying to k"
eep near Kutúzo
"v, saw on the
s"
lope of the hill
 amid the smoke 
a Russian batter
y that was still
 firing and Fre
nchmen running t
oward it. Higher
 up stood some R
"ussian infantry,"
 neither moving
 forward to prot
ect the battery 
nor backward wit
h the fleeing c
rowd. A mounted 
general separate
d himself from t
he infantry and 
 approached Kut�
�zov. Of Kutúzo
v’s suite only
 four remained. 
They were all p
ale and exchange
d looks in silen
ce.  “Stop t
hose wretches!�
� gasped Kutúzo
v to the regimen
"tal commander,
"
pointing to the 
flying soldiers;
 but at that ins
"tant, as if to p"
unish him for t
"hose words, bull"
ets flew hissing
 across the regi
ment and across 
 Kutúzov’s su
ite like a flock
 of little birds
.  The French 
had attacked the
" battery and, se"
"eing Kutúzov, w"
ere firing at h
im. After this v
olley the regime
ntal commander c
lutched at his l
eg; several sol
"diers fell, and "
a second lieuten
ant who was hold
ing the flag le
t it fall from h
is hands. It swa
"yed and fell, bu"
t caught on the 
 muskets of the 
nearest soldiers
. The soldiers s
tarted firing wi
thout orders. 
 “Oh! Oh! Oh!
” groaned Kut�
�zov despairingl
y and looked aro
und.... “Bolk
ónski!” he wh
"ispered, his voi"
ce trembling fro
m a consciousnes
s of the feeble
"ness of age, “"
Bolkónski!” h
"e whispered, poi"
nting to the di
sordered battali
on and at the en
"emy, “what’s"
 that?”  But
 before he had f
inished speaking
", Prince Andrew,"
 feeling tears o
f shame and ang
"er choking him, "
had already leap
t from his horse
 and run to the
 standard.  �
"�Forward, lads!�"
�� he shouted in
 a voice piercin
g as a child’s
.  “Here it 
is!” thought h
"e, seizing the s"
taff of the stan
dard and hearin
g with pleasure 
the whistle of b
ullets evidently
 aimed at him. 
Several soldiers
 fell.  “Hur
rah!” shouted 
"Prince Andrew, a"
"nd, scarcely abl"
e to hold up th
e heavy standard
", he ran forward"
 with full confi
dence that the w
hole battalion 
would follow him
.  And really 
he only ran a fe
w steps alone. O
ne soldier moved
 and then anoth
er and soon the 
whole battalion 
ran forward shou
ting “Hurrah!�
�� and overtook
 him. A sergeant
 of the battalio
n ran up and too
k the flag that
 was swaying fro
m its weight in 
Prince Andrew’
"s hands, but he"
 was immediately
 killed. Prince 
Andrew again sei
zed the standard
" and,
dragging "
"it by the staff,"
 ran on with the
 battalion. In f
ront he saw our 
"
artillerymen, s"
ome of whom were
" fighting, while"
" others, having "
abandoned their
" guns, were runn"
ing toward him. 
He also saw Fren
ch infantry sol
diers who were s
eizing the artil
lery horses and 
turning the guns
 round. Prince 
Andrew and the b
attalion were al
ready within twe
nty paces of th
e cannon. He hea
rd the whistle o
f bullets above 
him unceasingly 
and to right an
d left of him so
ldiers continual
ly groaned and d
ropped. But he 
did not look at 
them: he looked 
only at what was
 going on in fro
nt of him—at 
the battery. He 
now saw clearly 
the figure of a 
red-haired gunn
er with his shak
"o knocked awry, "
pulling one end 
of a mop while 
a French soldier
 tugged at the o
ther. He could d
istinctly see th
e distraught ye
t angry expressi
on on the faces 
of these two men
", who
evidently"
 did not realize
 what they were 
doing.  “Wha
t are they about
?” thought Pri
nce Andrew as he
 gazed at them. 
 “Why doesn’
t the red-haired
 gunner run away
 as he is unarme
d? Why doesn’
t the Frenchman 
stab him? He wil
l not get away b
efore the Frenc
hman remembers h
is bayonet and s
tabs him....” 
  And really an
other French sol
"dier, trailing h"
"is musket, ran u"
p to the strugg
"ling men, and th"
e fate of the re
"d-haired gunner,"
 who had triump
hantly secured t
he mop and still
 did not realize
 what awaited hi
"m,
was about to"
 be decided. But
 Prince Andrew d
id not see how i
t ended. It see
med to him as th
ough one of the 
soldiers near hi
m hit him on the
 head with the 
full swing of a 
bludgeon. It hur
"t a little, but "
the worst of it
 was that the pa
in distracted hi
m and prevented 
his seeing what 
he had been loo
king at.  “W
hat’s this? Am
 I falling? My l
egs are giving w
"ay,” thought h"
"e,
and fell on "
his back. He ope
"ned his eyes, ho"
ping to see how 
the struggle of
 the Frenchmen w
ith the gunners 
"ended, whether t"
he red-haired gu
nner had been k
illed or not and
 whether the can
non had been cap
tured or saved.
 But he saw noth
ing. Above him t
here was now not
hing but the sk
y—the lofty sk
"y, not clear yet"
 still immeasura
"bly lofty, with "
gray clouds gli
ding slowly acro
ss it. “How qu
"iet, peaceful, a"
nd solemn; not 
"at all as I ran,"
” thought Prin
ce Andrew—“n
"ot as we ran, sh"
outing and figh
"ting, not at all"
 as the gunner a
nd the Frenchman
 with frightened
 and angry face
s struggled for 
the mop: how dif
ferently do thos
e clouds glide 
across that loft
y infinite sky! 
How was it I did
 not see that l
ofty sky before?
 And how happy I
 am to have foun
d it at last! Ye
s! All is vanit
"y, all falsehood"
", except that in"
finite sky. Ther
"e is nothing,
n"
"othing, but that"
. But even it do
"es not exist, th"
ere is nothing b
ut quiet and pe
ace. Thank God!.

 CHAPTER XVII  
 On our right fl
ank commanded by
" Bagratión, at "
nine o’clock t
he battle had n
ot yet begun. No
t wishing to agr

 commence the ac
"tion, and wishin"
g to avert respo
nsibility from h
"imself,
Prince "
Bagratión propo
sed to Dolgorúk
ov to send to in
quire of the co
mmander in chief
. Bagratión kne
w that as the di
stance between t
he two flanks w
as more than six
" miles, even if "
the messenger we
re not killed (
which he very li
"kely would be), "
and found the co
mmander in chief
 (which would b
e very difficult
"), he would not "
be able to get b
ack before even
ing.  Bagrati�
�n cast his larg
"e, expressionles"
"s, sleepy eyes r"
"ound his suite,"
 and the boyish 
"face of Rostóv,"
 breathless with
 excitement and 
"hope, was
the f"
irst to catch hi
s eye. He sent h
im.  “And if
 I should meet H
is Majesty befor
e I meet the com
mander in chief
", your excellenc"
y?” said Rost�
"�v, with his han"
d to his cap.  
 “You can give
 the message to 
"His Majesty,” "
said Dolgorúkov
",
hurriedly int"
errupting Bagrat
ión.  On bein
g relieved from 
picket duty Rost
óv had managed 
to get a few ho
urs’ sleep bef
ore morning and 
"felt cheerful, b"
"old, and resolut"
"e,
with elastic"
"ity of movement,"
 faith in his go
"od fortune, and "
generally in th
at state of mind
 which makes eve
rything seem pos
"sible, pleasant,"
 and easy.  A
ll his wishes we
re being fulfill
ed that morning:
 there was to be
 a general enga
gement in which 
he was taking pa
"rt, more than th"
"at, he was
orde"
rly to the brave
"st general, and "
"still more, he w"
as going with a 
 message to Kut�
"�zov, perhaps ev"
en to the sovere
ign himself. The
 morning was br
"ight, he had a g"
ood horse under 
"him, and his hea"
rt was full of 
joy and happines
s. On receiving 
the order he gav
e his horse the 
rein and gallop
ed along the lin
e. At first he r
ode along the li
ne of Bagratió
"n’s troops, wh"
ich had not yet 
advanced into ac
tion but were s
tanding motionle
ss; then he came
 to the region o
ccupied by Uvár
ov’s cavalry 
and here he noti
ced a stir and s
igns of preparat
ion for battle; 
 having passed U
várov’s caval
ry he clearly he
ard the sound of
 cannon and mus
ketry ahead of h
im. The firing g
rew louder and l
ouder.  In the
 fresh morning a
ir were now hear
"d, not two or th"
ree musket shots
 at irregular i
ntervals as befo
"re, followed by "
one or two canno
"n shots,
but a "
roll of volleys 
of musketry from
 the slopes of t
he hill before 
"Pratzen, interru"
pted by such fre
quent reports of
 cannon that som
etimes several 
of them were not
 separated from 
one another but 
merged into a g
eneral roar.  
He could see puf
fs of musketry s
moke that seemed
 to chase one an
other down the 
"hillsides, and c"
louds of cannon 
"smoke rolling, s"
"preading,
and m"
ingling with one
 another. He cou
"ld also, by the "
gleam of bayonet
s visible throu
"gh the smoke, ma"
ke out moving ma
sses of infantry
 and narrow lin
es of artillery 
with green caiss
ons.  Rostóv 
stopped his hors
e for a moment o
n a hillock to s
ee what was goi
"ng on, but strai"
n his attention 
as he would he c
ould not underst
and or make out
 anything of wha
t was happening:
 there in the sm
oke men of some
 sort were movin
"g about, in fron"
t and behind mov
ed lines of troo
"ps;
but why, wh"
"ither, and who t"
"hey were, it was"
 impossible to m
ake out. These 
sights and sound
s had no depress
ing or intimidat
ing effect on hi
m; on the contr
"ary, they stimul"
ated his energy 
and determinatio
n.  “Go on! 
Go on! Give it t
hem!” he menta
lly exclaimed at
" these sounds,
"
and again procee
ded to gallop al
"ong the line, pe"
netrating farthe
r and farther i
nto the region w
here the army wa
s already in act
ion.  “How i
t will be there 
"I don’t know, "
but all will be 
well!” thought
 Rostóv.  Af
ter passing some
 Austrian troops
 he noticed that
 the next part o
f the line (the
 Guards) was alr
eady in action. 
  “So much th
e better! I shal
"l see it close,�"
�� he thought. 
 He was riding 
almost along the
 front line. A h
andful of men ca
me galloping to
ward him. They w
ere our Uhlans w
ho with disorder
ed ranks were r
eturning from th
e attack. Rostó
v got out of the
"ir way,
involun"
tarily noticed t
hat one of them 
"was bleeding, an"
d galloped on. 
 “That is no 
business of mine
",” he thought."
 He had not ridd
en many hundred
 yards after tha
t before he saw 
"to his left, acr"
oss the whole w
idth of the fiel
"d, an enormous m"
ass of cavalry i
n brilliant whit
"e
uniforms, mou"
nted on black ho
"rses, trotting s"
traight toward h
im and across h
is path. Rostóv
 put his horse t
o full gallop to
 get out of the 
 way of these me
"n, and he would "
have got clear h
ad they continue
d at the same s
"peed, but they k"
ept increasing t
"heir pace, so th"
at some of the 
horses were alre
ady galloping. R
ostóv heard the
 thud of their h
oofs and the ji
ngle of their we
apons and saw th
"eir horses, thei"
"r figures, and
"
even their faces
", more and more "
distinctly. They
 were our Horse 
"Guards,
advanci"
ng to attack the
 French cavalry 
that was coming 
to meet them.  
 The Horse Guard
s were galloping
", but still hold"
ing in their hor
ses. Rostóv co
uld already see 
their faces and 
heard the comman
d: “Charge!�
� shouted by an 
officer who was 
urging his thoro
ughbred to full
" speed. Rostóv,"
 fearing to be c
rushed or swept 
into the attack 
"on
the French, "
galloped along t
he front as hard
 as his horse co
"uld go, but
sti"
ll was not in ti
me to avoid them
.  The last of
 the Horse Guard
"s, a huge pockma"
"rked fellow, fro"
wned angrily on
 seeing Rostóv 
"before him, with"
 whom he would i
nevitably collid
e. This Guardsm
an would certain
ly have bowled R
ostóv and his B
edouin over (Ro
stóv felt himse
lf quite tiny an
d weak compared 
to these giganti
c men and horse
s) had it not oc
curred to Rostó
v to flourish hi
s whip before t
he eyes of the G
uardsman’s hor
se. The heavy bl
"ack horse, sixte"
"en
hands high, "
"shied, throwing "
back its ears; b
ut the pockmarke
d Guardsman dro
ve his huge spur
"s in violently, "
"and the horse, f"
lourishing its t
ail and extendi
"ng its neck, gal"
loped on yet fas
ter. Hardly had 
the Horse Guard
s passed Rostóv
 before he heard
" them shout, “"
Hurrah!” and 
looking back saw
 that their fore
most ranks were 
mixed up with so
me foreign cava
lry with red epa
"ulets, probably "
French. He could
 see nothing mo
"re, for immediat"
ely afterwards c
annon began firi
ng from somewher
e and smoke env
eloped everythin
g.  At that mo
"ment, as the Hor"
"se Guards, havin"
"g passed him, di"
sappeared in th
"e smoke, Rostóv"
 hesitated wheth
er to gallop aft
er them or to go
 where he was s
ent. This was th
e brilliant char
ge of the Horse 
Guards that ama
zed the French t
hemselves. Rost�
�v was horrified
 to hear later t
hat of all that
 mass of huge an
"d handsome men, "
of all those bri
"lliant,
rich yo"
"uths, officers a"
"nd cadets, who h"
ad galloped past
 him on their t
housand-ruble ho
"rses, only eight"
een were left af
ter the charge. 
  “Why should
 I envy them? My
 chance is not l
"ost, and maybe I"
 shall see the 
Emperor immediat
ely!” thought 
Rostóv and gall
oped on.  When
 he came level w
ith the Foot Gua
rds he noticed t
hat about them a
nd around them 
cannon balls wer
"e flying, of whi"
ch he was aware 
not so much bec
ause he heard th
eir sound as bec
ause he saw unea
siness on the s
oldiers’ faces
 and unnatural w
arlike solemnity
 on those of the
 officers.  P
assing behind on
e of the lines o
f a regiment of 
Foot Guards he h
eard a voice ca
lling him by nam
e.  “Rostóv
!”  “What?
"” he answered,"
 not recognizing
 Borís.  “I
" say, we’ve be"
en in the front 
line! Our regime
nt attacked!” 
said Borís wit
h the happy smil
e seen on the fa
ces of young men
 who have been 
under fire for t
he first time. 
 Rostóv stoppe
d.  “Have yo
u?” he said. �
"��Well, how did "
it go?”  “
We drove them ba
ck!” said Bor�
�s with animatio
"n, growing talka"
tive. “Can yo
u imagine it?”
 and he began de
scribing how the
" Guards, having"
 taken up their 
position and see
ing troops befor
"e them, thought "
they were Austr
"ians, and all at"
 once discovered
 from the cannon
 balls discharge
d by those troo
ps that they wer
e themselves in 
the front line a
nd had unexpect
edly to go into 
action. Rostóv 
without hearing 
Borís to the e
nd spurred his h
orse.  “Wher
e are you off to
?” asked Borí
s.  “With a 
message to His M
ajesty.”  �
�There he is!”
" said Borís, th"
inking Rostóv h
ad said “His 
"Highness,” and"
 pointing to the
 Grand Duke who 
with his high sh
oulders and fro
wning brows stoo
d a hundred pace
s away from them
 in his helmet 
and Horse Guards
"’ jacket, shou"
ting something t
"o a pale, white"
 uniformed Austr
ian officer.  
“But that’s 
"the Grand Duke, "
and I want the c
ommander in chie
f or the Empero
"r,” said Rost�"
"�v, and was abou"
t to spur his ho
rse.  “Count
! Count!” shou
ted Berg who ran
 up from the oth
er side as eager
 as Borís. “
Count! I am woun
ded in my right 
hand” (and he 
showed his blee
ding hand with a
 handkerchief ti
ed round it) “
and I remained a
t the front. I 
held my sword in
" my left hand, C"
ount. All our fa
mily—the von 
Bergs—have bee
n knights!”  
 He said somethi
"ng more, but Ros"
tóv did not wai
t to hear it and
 rode away.  
Having passed th
e Guards and tra
versed an empty 
"space, Rostóv, "
to avoid again 
getting in front
 of the first li
ne as he had don
e when the Horse
 Guards charged
", followed the l"
"ine of reserves,"
 going far round
 the place wher
e the hottest mu
sket fire and ca
nnonade were hea
rd. Suddenly he 
 heard musket fi
re quite close i
n front of him a
nd behind our tr
"oops,
where he "
could never have
 expected the en
emy to be.  �
�What can it be?
” he thought. 
“The enemy in 
the rear of our 
army? Impossibl
e!” And sudden
ly he was seized
 by a panic of f
ear for himself 
 and for the iss
ue of the whole 
battle. “But b
e that what it m
"ay,”
he refle"
"cted, “there i"
s no riding roun
d it now. I must
 look for the c
ommander in chie
"f here, and if a"
ll is lost it is
 for me to peris
h with the rest
.”  The fore
boding of evil t
hat had suddenly
 come over Rost�
�v was more and 
 more confirmed 
the farther he r
ode into the reg
ion behind the v
illage of Pratz
"en, which was fu"
ll of troops of 
all kinds.  �
�What does it me
an? What is it? 
Whom are they fi
ring at? Who is 
 firing?” Rost
óv kept asking 
as he came up to
 Russian and Aus
trian soldiers 
running in confu
sed crowds acros
s his path.  �
��The devil know
s! They’ve kil
led everybody! I
t’s all up now
!” he was tol
"d in Russian, Ge"
"rman, and Czech "
by the crowd of 
fugitives who u
nderstood what w
as happening as 
little as he did
.  “Kill the
 Germans!” sho
uted one.  “
May the devil ta
ke them—the tr
aitors!”  �
�Zum Henker dies
e Russen!” * m
uttered a German
.      * “Ha
ng these Russian
s!”   Sever
al wounded men p
assed along the 
"road, and words "
"of abuse, scream"
"s,
and groans m"
ingled in a gene
"ral hubbub, then"
 the firing died
 down. Rostóv 
learned later th
at Russian and A
ustrian soldiers
 had been firing
 at one another
.  “My God! 
What does it all
 mean?” though
t he. “And her
"e, where at
any"
 moment the Empe
ror may see them
".... But no, the"
se must be only 
a handful of sc
oundrels. It wil
"l soon be over, "
it can’t be th
"at, it
can’t "
be! Only to get 
past them quicke
"r, quicker!”
"
 The idea of de
feat and flight 
could not enter 
Rostóv’s head
. Though he saw
 French cannon a
nd French troops
 on the Pratzen 
Heights just whe
re he had been 
ordered to look 
for the commande
"r in chief, he c"
"ould not,
did n"
"ot wish to, beli"
eve that.    
   CHAPTER XVI
II  Rostóv ha
d been ordered t
o look for Kutú
zov and the Empe
ror near the vi
llage of Pratzen
. But neither th
ey nor a single 
commanding offic
"er
were there, "
only disorganize
d crowds of troo
ps of various ki
nds. He urged o
n his already we
ary horse to get
 quickly past th
"ese crowds, but"
 the farther he 
went the more di
sorganized they 
were. The highro
ad on which he 
had come out was
 thronged with c
"alèches, carria"
ges of all sort
"s, and Russian a"
nd Austrian sold
iers of all arms
", some wounded a"
nd some not. Th
is whole mass dr
oned and jostled
 in confusion un
der the dismal 
influence of can
non balls flying
 from the French
 batteries stat
ioned on the Pra
tzen Heights.  
 “Where is the
 Emperor? Where 
is Kutúzov?” 
Rostóv kept ask
ing everyone he
" could stop, but"
 got no answer f
rom anyone.  A
t last seizing a
 soldier by his 
collar he forced
 him to answer. 
"

“Eh, brothe"
r! They’ve all
 bolted long ago
!” said the so
"ldier,
laughing"
 for some reason
 and shaking him
self free.  Ha
ving left that s
oldier who was e
"vidently drunk, "
Rostóv stopped 
the horse of a 
batman or groom 
of some importan
t personage and 
began to questi
on him. The man 
announced that t
he Tsar had been
 driven in a ca
rriage at full s
peed about an ho
ur before along 
that very road a
nd that he was 
dangerously woun
ded.  “It ca
n’t be!” sai
d Rostóv. “It
 must have been 
someone else.”
  “I saw him
" myself,” repl"
ied the man with
 a self-confiden
t smile of deri
sion. “I ought
 to know the Emp
"eror by now, aft"
er the times I�
�ve seen him in
 Petersburg. I s
aw him just as I
 see you.... The
re he sat in th
e carriage as pa
le as anything. 
How they made th
e four black hor
ses fly! Gracio
"us me, they did "
rattle past! It�
��s time I knew 
the Imperial ho
rses and Ilyá I
ványch. I don�
�t think Ilyá d
rives anyone exc
ept the Tsar!�
�  Rostóv let
 go of the horse
 and was about t
"o ride on, when "
a wounded offic
er passing by ad
dressed him:  
“Who is it you
 want?” he ask
ed. “The comma
nder in chief? H
e was killed by
 a cannon ball�
�struck in the b
reast before our
 regiment.”  
 “Not killed�
�wounded!” ano
ther officer cor
rected him.  �
��Who? Kutúzov?
” asked Rostó
v.  “Not Kut
"úzov, but what�"
��s his name—w
"ell, never mind."
.. there are no
t many left aliv
"e. Go that way, "
"to that village,"
 all the command
"ers
are there,�"
�� said the offi
"cer, pointing to"
 the village of 
"Hosjeradek,
and"
 he walked on. 
 Rostóv rode o
n at a footpace 
not knowing why 
or to whom he wa
s now going. Th
e Emperor was wo
"unded, the battl"
e lost. It was i
mpossible to do
ubt it now. Rost
óv rode in the 
direction pointe
"d out to him, in"
 which he saw t
urrets and a chu
rch. What need t
o hurry? What wa
s he now to say 
 to the Tsar or 
"to Kutúzov, eve"
n if they were a
live and unwound
ed?  “Take t
"his road, your h"
"onor, that way y"
ou will be kille
d at once!” a 
 soldier shouted
 to him. “They
’d kill you th
ere!”  “Oh
", what are you t"
alking about?”
 said another. �
��Where is he to
 go? That way i
s nearer.”  
Rostóv consider
"ed, and then wen"
t in the directi
on where they sa
id he would be 
killed.  “It
’s all the sam
e now. If the Em
peror is wounded
", am I to try to"
 save myself?�
� he thought. He
 rode on to the 
region where the
 greatest numbe
r of men had per
ished in fleeing
 from Pratzen. T
he French had no
t yet occupied 
"that region, and"
 the Russians—
the uninjured an
d slightly woun
ded—had left i
t long ago. All 
"about the field,"
 like heaps of 
manure on well-k
"ept plowland, la"
y from ten to fi
fteen dead and w
ounded to each 
couple of acres.
 The wounded cre
pt together in t
wos and threes 
and one could he
ar their distres
sing screams and
" groans, sometim"
es feigned—or
 so it seemed to
 Rostóv. He put
 his horse to a 
trot to avoid s
eeing all these 
"suffering men, a"
nd he felt afrai
d—afraid not 
"for his life, bu"
t for the courag
e he needed and 
which he knew wo
uld not stand t
he sight of thes
e unfortunates. 
"

The French, w"
ho had ceased fi
ring at this fie
ld strewn with d
ead and wounded
 where there was
 no one left to 
"fire at, on seei"
ng an adjutant 
riding over it t
rained a gun on 
him and fired se
veral shots. The
 sensation of t
hose terrible wh
istling sounds a
nd of the corpse
s around him me
rged in Rostóv�
��s mind into a 
single feeling o
f terror and pit
y for himself. 
He remembered hi
s mother’s las
t letter. “Wha
t would she fee
"l,” thought he"
", “if she saw "
me here now on t
his field with t
he cannon aimed
 at me?”  In
 the village of 
Hosjeradek there
 were Russian tr
oops retiring fr
om the field of
" battle, who tho"
ugh still in som
e confusion were
 less disordere
d. The French ca
nnon did not rea
ch there and the
 musketry fire 
sounded far away
. Here everyone 
clearly saw and 
said that the ba
ttle was lost. 
No one whom Rost
óv asked could 
tell him where t
he Emperor or K
utúzov was. Som
e said the repor
t that the Emper
or was wounded w
"as
correct, oth"
ers that it was 
"not, and explain"
ed the false rum
or that had spr
ead by the fact 
that the Emperor
’s carriage ha
d really gallope
d from the fiel
d of battle with
 the pale and te
rrified Ober-Hof
marschal Count 
"Tolstóy, who ha"
d ridden out to 
the battlefield 
with others in 
the Emperor’s 
suite. One offic
er told Rostóv 
that he had seen
 someone from h
eadquarters behi
nd the village t
"o the left, and "
thither Rostóv 
"
rode, not hopin"
g to find anyone
 but merely to e
ase his conscien
ce. When he had
 ridden about tw
o miles and had 
passed the last 
of the Russian 
"troops, he saw, "
near a kitchen g
arden with a dit
"ch round it, two"
 men on horseba
ck facing the di
tch. One with a 
white plume in h
is hat seemed f
amiliar to Rost�
�v; the other on
 a beautiful che
stnut horse (whi
ch Rostóv fanc
ied he had seen 
before) rode up 
"to the ditch, st"
ruck his horse 
"with his spurs, "
and giving it th
e rein leaped li
ghtly over. Only
 a little earth
 crumbled from t
he bank under th
e horse’s hind
 hoofs. Turning
 the horse sharp
"ly, he again jum"
"ped the ditch, a"
nd deferentially
 addressed the 
horseman with th
"e white plumes, "
evidently sugges
ting that he sh
ould do the same
". The rider, who"
se figure seemed
 familiar to Ro
stóv and involu
ntarily riveted 
"his attention, m"
ade a gesture of
 refusal with h
is head and hand
 and by that ges
ture Rostóv ins
tantly recogniz
ed his lamented 
and adored monar
ch.  “But it
" can’t be he, "
alone in the mid
st of this empty
 field!” thou
ght Rostóv. At 
that moment Alex
ander turned his
 head and Rostó
v saw the belov
ed features that
 were so deeply 
engraved on his 
memory. The Emp
"eror was pale, h"
is cheeks sunken
 and his eyes ho
"llow, but the ch"
"arm,
the mildne"
ss of his featur
"es, was all the "
greater. Rostóv
 was happy in t
he assurance tha
t the rumors abo
ut the Emperor b
eing wounded wer
e false. He was
 happy to be see
ing him. He knew
 that he might a
nd even ought t
o go straight to
 him and give th
e message Dolgor
úkov had ordere
d him to delive
r.  But as a y
outh in love tre
"mbles, is unnerv"
"ed, and dares no"
t utter the tho
ughts he has dre
amed of for nigh
"ts, but looks ar"
ound for help or
 a chance of de
lay and flight w
hen the longed-f
or moment comes 
and he is alone
" with her, so Ro"
"stóv, now that "
he had attained 
what he had long
ed for more tha
n anything else 
"in the world, di"
d not know how t
o approach the 
"Emperor, and a t"
housand reasons 
occurred to him 
why it would be 
"
inconvenient, u"
"nseemly, and imp"
ossible to do so
.  “What! It
 is as if I were
 glad of a chanc
e to take advant
age of his bein
g alone and desp
ondent! A strang
e face may seem 
unpleasant or p
ainful to him at
 this moment of 
"sorrow; besides,"
 what can I say 
"to him
now, whe"
n my heart fails
 me and my mouth
 feels dry at th
e mere sight of
 him?” Not one
 of the innumera
ble speeches add
ressed to the Em
peror that he h
ad composed in h
is imagination c
ould he now reca
ll. Those speec
hes were intende
d for quite othe
"r conditions, th"
ey were for the 
 most part to be
 spoken at a mom
ent of victory a
"nd triumph, gene"
rally when he w
as dying of woun
ds and the sover
eign had thanked
 him for heroic 
"
deeds, and whil"
e dying he expre
ssed the love hi
s actions had pr
oved.  “Besi
des how can I as
k the Emperor fo
r his instructio
ns for the right
 flank now that
 it is nearly fo
ur o’clock and
 the battle is l
"ost?
No, certai"
nly I must not a
"pproach him, I m"
ust not intrude 
on his reflecti
ons. Better die 
a thousand times
 than risk recei
ving an unkind 
look or bad opin
"ion from him,”"
 Rostóv decided
; and sorrowfull
y and with a he
art full despair
" he rode away, c"
ontinually looki
ng back at the 
"Tsar, who still "
remained in the 
same attitude of
 indecision.  
While Rostóv wa
s thus arguing w
ith himself and 
riding sadly awa
"y,
Captain von "
Toll chanced to 
ride to the same
" spot, and seein"
g the Emperor a
t once rode up t
"o him, offered h"
"is services, and"
 assisted him t
o cross the ditc
h on foot. The E
"mperor, wishing "
to rest and feel
"ing
unwell, sat"
 down under an a
pple tree and vo
n Toll remained 
beside him. Ros
tóv from a dist
ance saw with en
vy and remorse h
ow von Toll spok
e long and warm
ly to the Empero
r and how the Em
"peror, evidently"
" weeping,
cover"
ed his eyes with
 his hand and pr
essed von Toll�
�s hand.  “A
nd I might have 
been in his plac
e!” thought Ro
"stóv, and hardl"
y restraining h
is tears of pity
 for the Emperor
", he rode on in "
"utter
despair, "
not knowing wher
e to or why he w
as now riding. 
 His despair wa
s all the greate
r from feeling t
hat his own weak
ness was the ca
use of his grief
.  He might...
 not only might 
"but should, have"
 gone up to the 
sovereign. It w
as a unique chan
ce to show his d
evotion to the E
mperor and he ha
d not made use 
of it.... “Wha
t have I done?�
� thought he. An
d he turned rou
nd and galloped 
back to the plac
e where he had s
"een the Emperor,"
 but there was 
no one beyond th
e ditch now. Onl
y some carts and
 carriages were
 passing by. Fro
m one of the dri
vers he learned 
that Kutúzov’
s staff were no
"t far off, in th"
e village the ve
hicles were goin
g to. Rostóv f
ollowed them. In
 front of him wa
lked Kutúzov’
s groom leading 
 horses in horse
cloths. Then cam
"e a cart, and be"
hind that walked
" an old,
bandy-"
legged domestic 
serf in a peaked
 cap and sheepsk
in coat.  “T
"it! I say, Tit!�"
�� said the groo
m.  “What?�
� answered the o
ld man absent-mi
ndedly.  “Go
", Tit! Thresh a "
bit!”  “Oh
", you fool!” s"
"aid the old man,"
 spitting angril
y. Some time pas
"sed
in silence,"
 and then the sa
me joke was repe
ated.   Befor
e five in the ev
ening the battle
 had been lost a
t all points. Mo
re than a hundr
ed cannon were a
lready in the ha
nds of the Frenc
h.  Przebyszé
wski and his cor
ps had laid down
 their arms. Oth
er columns afte
r losing half th
eir men were ret
reating in disor
derly confused 
masses.  The r
emains of Langer
on’s and Dokht
úrov’s mingle
d forces were c
rowding around t
he dams and bank
s of the ponds n
ear the village 
of Augesd.  A
fter five o’cl
ock it was only 
at the Augesd Da
m that a hot can
nonade (deliver
ed by the French
 alone) was stil
l to be heard fr
om numerous bat
teries ranged on
 the slopes of t
he Pratzen Heigh
"ts, directed at "
our retreating 
forces.  In th
"e rearguard, Dok"
htúrov and othe
rs rallying some
 battalions kept
 up a musketry 
fire at the Fren
ch cavalry that 
was pursuing our
 troops. It was
 growing dusk. O
n the narrow Aug
esd Dam where fo
r so many years 
the old miller 
had been accusto
med to sit in hi
s tasseled cap p
eacefully angli
"ng, while his gr"
"andson, with shi"
rt sleeves rolle
"d up, handled th"
e floundering s
ilvery fish in t
"he watering can,"
 on that dam ove
r which for so 
many years Morav
ians in shaggy c
aps and blue jac
kets had peacefu
lly driven thei
r two-horse cart
s loaded with wh
eat and had retu
rned dusty with
 flour whitening
 their carts—o
n that narrow da
m amid the wagon
s and the canno
"n, under the hor"
ses’ hoofs and
 between the wag
"on wheels,
men "
disfigured by fe
ar of death now 
crowded together
", crushing one
"
"another, dying, "
stepping over th
e dying and kill
"ing one another,"
 only to move o
n a few steps an
d be killed them
selves in the sa
me way.  Every
 ten seconds a c
annon ball flew 
compressing the 
"air around, or
"
a shell burst in
 the midst of th
"at dense throng,"
 killing some an
d splashing wit
h blood those ne
ar them.  Dól
okhov—now an o
fficer—wounded
" in the arm, and"
" on foot, with
"
the regimental c
ommander on hors
eback and some t
en men of his co
"mpany,
represen"
ted all that was
 left of that wh
ole regiment. Im
pelled by the c
"rowd, they had g"
ot wedged in at 
the approach to 
"the dam and, jam"
med in on all s
"ides, had stoppe"
d because a hors
e in front had f
allen under a c
annon and the cr
owd were draggin
g it out. A cann
on ball killed s
omeone behind t
"hem, another fel"
l in front and s
plashed Dólokho
v with blood. T
"he crowd, pushin"
g forward desper
"ately, squeezed "
"together, moved "
"a few
steps, an"
d again stopped.
  “Move on a
 hundred yards a
nd we are certai
"nly saved, remai"
n here another 
two minutes and 
it is certain de
"ath,” thought "
each one.  Dó
lokhov who was i
n the midst of t
he crowd forced 
his way to the e
"dge
of the dam,"
 throwing two so
ldiers off their
" feet, and ran o"
nto the slipper
y ice that cover
ed the millpool.
  “Turn this
 way!” he shou
"ted, jumping ove"
r the ice which 
creaked under h
im; “turn this
 way!” he shou
ted to those wit
h the gun. “It
 bears!...” 
 The ice bore h
im but it swayed
" and creaked, an"
d it was plain t
hat it would gi
ve way not only 
under a cannon o
"r a crowd, but v"
ery soon even u
nder his weight 
alone. The men l
ooked at him and
 pressed to the 
"
bank, hesitatin"
g to step onto t
he ice. The gene
ral on horseback
 at the entranc
e to the dam rai
sed his hand and
 opened his mout
h to address D�
�lokhov. Suddenl
y a cannon ball 
hissed so low ab
ove the crowd th
at everyone duc
ked. It flopped 
into something m
"oist, and the ge"
neral fell from
 his horse in a 
pool of blood. N
obody gave him a
 look or thought
 of raising him
.  “Get onto
" the ice, over t"
he ice! Go on! T
urn! Don’t you
 hear? Go on!�
� innumerable vo
ices suddenly sh
outed after the 
ball had struck 
"
the general, th"
e men themselves
 not knowing wha
"t, or why, they "
were shouting. 
  One of the hi
ndmost guns that
 was going onto 
the dam turned o
ff onto the ice
. Crowds of sold
iers from the da
m began running 
onto the frozen 
pond. The ice g
ave way under on
e of the foremos
"t soldiers, and "
one leg slipped 
 into the water.
 He tried to rig
ht himself but f
ell in up to his
 waist. The nea
rest soldiers sh
"rank back, the g"
un driver stoppe
"d his horse, but"
 from behind st
ill came the sho
uts: “Onto the
" ice, why do you"
 stop? Go on! G
o on!” And cri
es of horror wer
e heard in the c
rowd. The soldie
rs near the gun
 waved their arm
s and beat the h
orses to make th
em turn and mov
e on. The horses
 moved off the b
"ank. The ice, th"
at had held unde
r those on foot
", collapsed in a"
" great mass, and"
 some forty men 
who were on it 
"dashed, some for"
ward and some ba
"ck, drowning one"
 another.  Sti
ll the cannon ba
lls continued re

      CHAPT
ER XIX  On the
 Pratzen Heights
", where he had f"
allen with the f
lagstaff in his 
"
hand, lay Princ"
e Andrew Bolkón
ski bleeding pro
fusely and uncon
sciously utteri
"ng a gentle, pit"
"eous, and childl"
ike moan.  Tow
ard evening he c
eased moaning an
d became quite s
till. He did not
 know how long 
his unconsciousn
ess lasted. Sudd
enly he again fe
lt that he was 
alive and suffer
ing from a burni
"ng, lacerating p"
ain in his head.
  “Where is 
"it, that lofty s"
ky that I did no
"t know till now,"
 but saw today?
” was his firs
t thought. “An
d I did not know
 this suffering 
"
either,” he t"
"hought. “Yes, "
I did not know a
"nything, anythin"
g at all till n
ow. But where am
 I?”  He lis
tened and heard 
the sound of app
"roaching horses,"
 and voices spe
aking French. He
 opened his eyes
. Above him agai
n was the same l
ofty sky with c
louds that had r
isen and were fl
oating still hig
"her, and
betwee"
n them gleamed b
lue infinity. He
 did not turn hi
s head and did n
ot see those wh
"o, judging by th"
e sound of hoofs
" and voices, had"
 ridden up and 
stopped near him
.  It was Napo
leon accompanied
 by two aides-de
-camp. Bonaparte
 riding over th
e battlefield ha
d given final or
ders to strength
en the batteries
 firing at the 
Augesd Dam and w
as looking at th
e killed and wou
nded left on th
e field.  “F
ine men!” rema
"rked Napoleon, l"
ooking at a dead
 Russian grenadi
"er,
who, with h"
is face buried i
n the ground and
 a blackened nap
"e, lay on his
s"
tomach with an a
lready stiffened
 arm flung wide.
  “The ammun

aid an adjutant 
who had come fro

that were firin

“Have some bro

dropped beside h
im. (The flag ha
d already been 
taken by the Fre
nch as a trophy.
)  “That’s
 a fine death!�
� said Napoleon 
as he gazed at B
olkónski.  Pr
ince Andrew unde
rstood that this
 was said of him
 and that it was
 Napoleon who s
aid it. He heard
 the speaker add
ressed as Sire. 
But he heard th
e words as he mi
ght have heard t
he buzzing of a 
fly. Not only d
id they not inte
"rest him, but he"
 took no notice 
of them and at o
nce forgot them
. His head was b
"urning, he felt "
himself bleeding
" to death,
and "
he saw above him
" the remote, lof"
"ty, and everlast"
ing sky. He knew
 it was Napoleo
n—his hero—b
ut at that momen
t Napoleon seeme
d to him such a
" small, insignif"
icant creature c
ompared with wha
t was passing no
w between himse
lf and that loft
y infinite sky w
ith the clouds f
lying over it. 
At that moment i
t meant nothing 
to him who might
 be standing ove
"r
him, or what "
was said of him;
 he was only gla
d that people we
re standing nea
r him and only w
ished that they 
would help him a
nd bring him bac
"k to
life, whic"
h seemed to him 
so beautiful now
 that he had tod
ay learned to u
nderstand it so 
differently. He 
collected all hi
"s strength, to s"
tir and utter a
 sound. He feebl
y moved his leg 
and uttered a we
"ak, sickly groan"
 which aroused 
his own pity.  
 “Ah! He is al
"ive,” said Nap"
oleon. “Lift t
his young man up
 and carry him 
to the dressing 
station.”  H
"aving said this,"
 Napoleon rode o
n to meet Marsha
"l Lannes, who, h"
"at in
hand, rod"
e up smiling to 
the Emperor to c
ongratulate him 
on the victory. 
  Prince Andrew
 remembered noth
ing more: he los
t consciousness 
from the terrib
le pain of being
 lifted onto the
" stretcher, the "
jolting while b
"eing moved, and "
the probing of h
is wound at the 
dressing station
. He did not re
gain consciousne
ss till late in 
"the day, when wi"
th other wounde
d and captured R
ussian officers 
he was carried t
o the hospital. 
 During this tra
nsfer he felt a 
little stronger 
and was able to 
look about him 
and even speak. 
  The first wor
ds he heard on c
oming to his sen
ses were those o
f a French conv
"oy officer, who "
said rapidly: �
�We must halt he
re: the Emperor 
 will pass here 
immediately; it 
will please him 
to see these gen
tlemen prisoner
s.”  “Ther
e are so many pr
"isoners today, n"
early the whole 
"Russian army,
t"
hat he is probab
ly tired of them
",” said anothe"
r officer.  �
�All the same! T
hey say this one
 is the commande

eror Alexander�
"��s Guards,” s"
aid the first on
"e, indicating a "
Russian officer
 in the white un
iform of the Hor

lkónski recogni
zed Prince Repn�

et in Petersburg
 society. Besid
e him stood a la
"d of nineteen, a"
lso a wounded of
ficer of the Ho
rse Guards.  B
"onaparte, having"
 come up at a ga
"llop, stopped hi"
s horse.  “W
hich is the seni
"or?” he asked,"
 on seeing the p
risoners.  The
y named the colo
"nel, Prince Repn"
ín.  “You a

 of the Emperor 
Alexander’s re
giment of Horse 
 Guards?” aske
d Napoleon.  �
��I commanded a 
"squadron,” rep"
lied Repnín.  
 “Your regimen
t fulfilled its 
"duty honorably,�"
�� said Napoleon
.  “The prai

dier’s highest
" reward,”
sai"
d Repnín.  �
�I bestow it wit

�And who is that

d.  “He’s 
very young to co

outh is no hindr
"ance to courage,"
” muttered Suk
htélen in a fai
ling voice.  
“A splendid re
ply!” said Nap
oleon. “Young 
"man, you will go"
 far!”  Prin
"ce Andrew, who h"
ad also been bro
ught forward bef
ore the Emperor�
��s eyes to com
plete the show o
"f prisoners, cou"
ld not fail to a
ttract his atte

apparently remem
bered seeing him
 on the battlefi
"eld
and, addres"
"sing him, again "
used the epithet
 “young man”
 that was conne
cted in his memo
ry with Prince A
ndrew.  “Wel
"l, and you, youn"
"g man,” said h"
e. “How do you
" feel, mon
brav"
e?”  Though 
five minutes bef
"ore, Prince Andr"
ew had been able
 to say a few w
ords to the sold
iers who were ca
"rrying him, now "
with his eyes fi
xed straight on
" Napoleon, he wa"
s silent.... So 
insignificant at
 that moment se
emed to him all 
the interests th
at engrossed Nap
"oleon, so mean d"
id his hero him
self with his pa
ltry vanity and 
joy in victory a
"ppear,
compared"
" to the lofty, e"
"quitable, and ki"
ndly sky which h
e had seen and 
"understood, that"
 he could not an
swer him.  Eve
rything seemed s
o futile and ins
ignificant in co
mparison with th
e stern and sol
emn train of tho
ught that weakne
ss from loss of 
"blood,
sufferin"
"g, and the nearn"
ess of death aro
used in him. Loo
king into Napol
eon’s eyes Pri
nce Andrew thoug
ht of the insign
ificance of gre
"atness, the unim"
portance of life
 which no one co
"uld understand, "
and the still g
reater unimporta
"nce of death, th"
e meaning of whi
ch no one alive
 could understan
d or explain.  
 The Emperor wit
hout waiting for
 an answer turne
d away and said 
to one of the o
fficers as he we
nt: “Have thes
e gentlemen atte
nded to and take
n to my bivouac
"; let my doctor,"
" Larrey, examine"
 their wounds. A
"u revoir,
Princ"
e Repnín!” an
d he spurred his
 horse and gallo
ped away.  His
 face shone with
 self-satisfacti
on and pleasure.
  The soldiers
 who had carried
 Prince Andrew h
ad noticed and t
aken the little
 gold icon Princ
ess Mary had hun
g round her brot
"her’s neck, bu"
t seeing the fa
vor the Emperor 
showed the priso
"ners, they now h"
astened to retu
rn the holy imag
e.  Prince And
rew did not see 
how and by whom 
"it was replaced,"
 but the little
 icon with its t
hin gold chain s
uddenly appeared
 upon his chest 
 outside his uni
form.  “It w
"ould be good,”"
 thought Prince 
"Andrew, glancing"
 at the icon his
 sister had hun
g round his neck
 with such emoti
on and reverence
", “it
would b"
e good if everyt
hing were as cle
ar and simple as
 it seems to Ma
ry. How good it 
would be to know
 where to seek f
or help in this 
"life,
and what "
to expect after 
it beyond the gr
ave! How happy a
nd calm I shoul
d be if I could 
now say: ‘Lord
", have mercy on "
me!’... But to
 whom should I 
say that? Either
 to a Power inde
"finable, incompr"
"ehensible,
whic"
h I not only can
not address but 
which I cannot e
ven express in 
words—the Grea
t All or Nothing
-” said he to 
"himself, “or t"
o that God who 
has been sewn in
to this amulet b
y Mary! There is
 nothing certai
"n, nothing at al"
l except the uni
mportance of eve
rything I under
"stand, and the g"
reatness of some
thing incomprehe
nsible but all-
important.”  
 The stretchers 
moved on. At eve
ry jolt he again
 felt unendurabl
e pain; his fev
erishness increa
sed and he grew 
delirious. Visio
ns of his father
",
wife, sister,"
" and future son,"
 and the tendern
ess he had felt 
the night befor
"e the battle, th"
e figure of the 
insignificant li

nd above all th
is the lofty sky
", formed the chi"

sympathizing loo
k of shortsight
ed delight at th
e misery of othe
"rs, and doubts a"

" followed, and o"
nly the heavens 
promised peace. 
Toward morning 
all these dreams
 melted and merg

OK FOUR: 1806  
     CHAPTER
 I  Early in t

holas Rostóv re
turned home on l
eave. Denísov 
was going home t
o Vorónezh and 
Rostóv persuade
d him to travel 
with him as far
 as Moscow and t
o stay with him 
there. Meeting a
 comrade at the
 last post stati
on but one befor
"e Moscow, Denís"
ov had drunk thr
ee bottles of w
ine with him and
", despite the jo"
lting ruts acros
s the snow-cove
"red road, did no"
t once wake up o
n the way to Mos
"cow, but lay
at"
 the bottom of t
he sleigh beside
" Rostóv, who gr"
ew more and more
 impatient the 
nearer they got 
to Moscow.  �
�How much longer
? How much longe
"r? Oh, these ins"
ufferable street
"s,
shops, baker"
"s’ signboards,"
" street lamps, a"
nd sleighs!” t
"hought
Rostóv,"
 when their leav
e permits had be
en passed at the
 town gate and 
they had entered
 Moscow.  “D
enísov! We’re
 here! He’s as
"leep,” he adde"
"d, leaning forwa"
rd with his who
le body as if in
 that position h
e hoped to haste
n the speed of 
the sleigh.  D
enísov gave no 
answer.  “Th
ere’s the corn
er at the crossr
"oads, where the "
"cabman, Zakhár,"
"
has his stand,"
 and there’s Z
akhár himself a
nd still the sam
e horse! And he
re’s the littl
e shop where we 
used to buy ging
erbread! Can’t
 you hurry up? 
Now then!”  
“Which house i
s it?” asked t
he driver.  �
"�Why, that one, "
right at the end
", the big one. D"
on’t you see? 
 That’s our ho
"use,” said Ros"
tóv. “Of cour
"se, it’s our h"
"ouse!
Denísov,"
 Denísov! We’
re almost there!
”  Denísov 
"raised his head,"
" coughed, and ma"
de no answer.  
"
“Dmítri,” "
said Rostóv to 
his valet on the
" box, “those l"
ights are in ou
"r house, aren’"
t they?”  �
"�Yes, sir, and t"
here’s a light
 in your father�
��s study.”  
 “Then they’
ve not gone to b
ed yet? What do 
you think? Mind 
"now,
don’t fo"
rget to put out 
"my new coat,” "
"added Rostóv, f"
ingering his ne
w mustache. “N
"ow then, get on,"
” he shouted t
o the driver. �
"�Do
wake up, V�"
�ska!” he went
" on, turning to "
"Denísov, whose "
head was again 
nodding. “Come
", get on! You sh"
all have three r
ubles for vodka
—get on!” Ro
"stóv shouted, w"
hen the sleigh w
as only three h
ouses from his d
oor. It seemed t
o him the horses
 were not moving
 at all. At las
t the sleigh bor
"e to the right, "
drew up at an en
"trance, and
Ros"
tóv saw overhea
d the old famili
ar cornice with 
a bit of plaster
"
broken off, th"
"e porch, and the"
 post by the sid
e of the pavemen
t. He sprang ou
t before the sle
"igh stopped, and"
 ran into the ha
ll. The house s
tood cold and si
"lent, as if quit"
e regardless of 
who had come to 
it. There was n
o one in the hal
l. “Oh God! Is
 everyone all ri
ght?” he thou
"ght, stopping fo"
r a moment with 
"a sinking heart,"
 and then immed
iately starting 
to run along the
 hall and up the
 warped steps of
 the familiar s
taircase. The we
ll-known old doo
"r handle, which "
always angered 
the countess whe
n it was not pro
"perly cleaned, t"
urned as loosely
 as ever. A sol
itary tallow can
dle burned in th
e anteroom.  O
ld Michael was a
sleep on the che

"e footman, who w"
as so strong th
at he could lift
 the back of the
 carriage from b
"ehind, sat

up at the openin

expression of sl
eepy indifferenc

lighted amazemen

oung count!” h
"e cried, recogni"
zing his young 
master. “Can i
t be? My treasur

"fy, trembling wi"
"th
excitement, "
rushed toward th
e drawing room d
"oor, probably in"
 order to annou
"nce him, but, ch"
"anging his mind,"
 came back and s
tooped to kiss t

s shoulder.  �
��All well?” a
"sked Rostóv, dr"
awing away his a

“Yes, G"

Rostóv, who h"

", not wishing an"
yone to foresta
"ll him, threw of"
f his fur coat a
nd ran on tiptoe
 through the la
rge dark ballroo
m. All was the s
ame: there were 
the same old car
d tables and th
e same chandelie
r with a cover o
ver it; but some
one had already
 seen the young 
"master, and, bef"
ore he had reach
ed the drawing 
"room, something "
flew out from a 
side door like a
 tornado and beg
an hugging and 
kissing him. Ano
ther and yet ano
ther creature of
 the same kind 
sprang from a se
cond door and a 
third; more hugg

more outcrie"
"s, and tears of "
joy. He could no
t distinguish wh
"ich was
Papa, w"
"hich Natásha, a"
nd which Pétya.
 Everyone shoute

"
kissed him at th
e same time. Onl

 “And I did no

 and pranced up

piercingly.  A
ll around were l

ening with tears
" of joy, and all"
 around were li
ps seeking a kis
s.  Sónya too
", all rosy red, "
clung to his arm
" and, radiant wi"

looke"
d eagerly toward
" his eyes, waiti"

for which she l
onged. Sónya no

"im, not taking

d holding her br

l expectant and 
looking for some

 steps were hear

"it was she, dres"

" let him go, and"
 he ran to her. 
"When they
met, "
she fell on his 
"breast, sobbing."
 She could not l

t only pressed 
it to the cold b
raiding of his h

who"
 had come into t

ed his eyes at 
the sight.  �
�Vasíli Deníso

�You are most we
"lcome! I know, I"

"he count, kissin"

 Denísov. “Ni

".. Natásha, Vé"

  The same happ

 shaggy figure o
f Denísov.  �
��Darling Denís

"Natásha, beside"
 herself with ra

  Denísov was 
shown to the roo
m prepared for h
"im, and the Rost"
óvs all gather
ed round Nichola
s in the sitting
 room.  The ol
"d countess, not "
letting go of hi

"him: the rest, c"
rowding round hi

"
Rostóv was very
 happy in the lo
ve they showed h
im; but the firs
t moment of mee
ting had been so
 beatific that h
is present joy s
eemed insuffici
"ent, and he kept"
 expecting somet

and yet more.  
"
Next morning, a"
fter the fatigue
s of their journ
"ey, the traveler"

n o’clock.  
In the room next
 to their bedroo
m there was a co
nfusion of saber

"bretaches, open "
"portmanteaus, an"
d dirty boots. T
wo freshly clea

here was a mascu
line odor and a 
smell of tobacco

“Hallo, G"
wíska—my pipe
!” came Vasíl
i Denísov’s h
usky voice. “
"Wostóv, get up!"
"”

Rostóv, "
rubbing his eyes

"
“Why, is it l"

te! It’s nearl

” answered Nat

 A rustle of st
arched petticoat

ring and laughte

the adjoining ro
om. The door was
 opened a crack
 and there was a
 glimpse of some

 “Nicholas! Ge

a’s voice was 
again heard at t
he door.  “D
irectly!”  M
"eanwhile, Pétya"
", having found a"
nd seized the sa
bers in the oute
"r room,
with th"
e delight boys f
eel at the sight
 of a military e
"lder brother, an"
d forgetting th
at it was unbeco
ming for the gir
ls to see men un
"dressed,
opened"
 the bedroom doo
r.  “Is this
 your saber?” 
he shouted.  T
he girls sprang 
aside. Denísov 
hid his hairy le
gs under the bla
"nket,
looking w"
ith a scared fac
e at his comrade
 for help. The d
"oor, having let"
"
Pétya in, clos"
ed again. A soun
d of laughter ca
me from behind i
t.  “Nichola
s! Come out in y
our dressing gow
n!” said Natá
sha’s voice. 
 “Is this you
r saber?” aske
d Pétya. “Or 
is it yours?” 
"he said,
addres"
sing the black-m
ustached Deníso
v with servile d
eference.  Ros
tóv hurriedly p
ut something on 
"his feet, drew o"
n his dressing g
"own,
and went o"
ut. Natásha had
 put on one spur
red boot and was
 just getting h
er foot into the
" other. Sónya, "
"when he came in,"
 was twirling ro
und and was abo
ut to expand her
 dresses into a 
balloon and sit 
down. They were 
"
dressed alike, "
in new pale-blue
" frocks, and wer"
"e both fresh, ro"
"sy, and
bright."
 Sónya ran away
", but Natásha, "
taking her broth
"er’s arm, led"
 him into the si
"tting room, wher"
e they began tal
king. They hardl
y gave one anot
her time to ask 
questions and gi
ve replies conce
rning a thousand
 little matters
 which could not
 interest anyone
 but themselves.
 Natásha laugh
ed at every word
 he said or that
 she said hersel
"f, not because w"
hat they were s
aying was amusin
"g, but because s"
he felt happy an
d was unable to
 control her joy
 which expressed
 itself by laugh
"ter.

“Oh, h"
"ow nice, how spl"
endid!” she sa
id to everything
.  Rostóv fel
"t that, under th"
e influence of t
he warm rays of 
"love, that
chil"
dlike smile whic
h had not once a
ppeared on his f
ace since he lef
t home now for 
the first time a
fter eighteen mo
nths again brigh
tened his soul 
and his face.  
"
“No, but list"
"en,” she said,"
 “now you are 
"quite a man, are"
n’t you? I’
m awfully glad y
ou’re my broth
er.” She touch
ed his mustache
. “I want to k
now what you men
 are like. Are y
ou the same as 
we? No?”  �
�Why did Sónya 
run away?” ask
ed Rostóv.  �
"��Ah, yes! That�"
��s a whole long
 story! How are 
you going to spe
ak to her—tho
u or you?”  
“As may happen
",” said Rostó"
"v.

“No, cal"
"l her you, pleas"
e! I’ll tell y
ou all about it 
some other time
". No, I’ll tel"
l you now. You k
now Sónya’s m
y dearest friend
. Such a friend
 that I burned m
y arm for her sa
ke. Look here!�
�  She pulled 
up her muslin sl
eeve and showed 
him a red scar o
"n her long,
sle"
"nder, delicate a"
"rm, high above t"
he elbow on that
 part that is co
vered even by a
 ball dress.  
“I burned this
 to prove my lov
e for her. I jus
t heated a ruler
 in the fire an
d pressed it the
re!”  Sittin
g on the sofa wi
th the little cu
shions on its ar
"ms, in what used"
 to be his old 
"schoolroom, and "
looking into Nat
ásha’s wildly
" bright
eyes, R"
ostóv re-entere
d that world of 
home and childho
od which had no 
 meaning for any
"one else, but ga"
ve him some of t
he best joys of 
his life; and t
he burning of an
 arm with a rule
r as a proof of 
love did not see
m to him sensel
"ess, he understo"
od and was not s
urprised at it. 
"

“Well, and "
is that all?” 
he asked.  “
We are such frie
"nds, such friend"
s! All that rule
r business was j
"ust
nonsense, b"
ut we are friend
"s forever. She, "
if she loves any
"one, does it
fo"
"r life, but I do"
n’t understand
" that, I forget "
quickly.”  �
"��Well, what the"
n?”  “Well
", she loves me a"
nd you like that
.”  Natásha
 suddenly flushe
"d.

“Why, yo"
u remember befor
e you went away?
"... Well, she sa"
ys you are to f
orget all that..
.. She says: ‘
I shall love him
" always, but let"
 him be free.�
� Isn’t that l
ovely and noble!
" Yes, very noble"
? Isn’t it?”
 asked Natásha
", so seriously a"
nd excitedly tha
t it was evident
 that what she 
was now saying s
he had talked of
" before, with te"
ars.  Rostóv 
became thoughtfu
l.  “I never
 go back on my w
"ord,” he said."
" “Besides, Só"
nya is so charm
ing that only a 
fool would renou
nce such happine
"ss.”

“No,"
 no!” cried Na
"tásha, “she a"
nd I have alread
y talked it over
. We knew you�
�d say so. But i
"t won’t do, be"
"cause you see, i"
f you say that�
��if you conside
r yourself bound
 by your promise
—it will seem 
as if she had n
ot meant it seri
ously. It makes 
it as if you wer
e marrying her 
because you must
", and that would"
n’t do at all.
”  Rostóv s
aw that it had b
een well conside
red by them. Só
nya had already 
 struck him by h
er beauty on the
 preceding day. 
"Today, when he h"
ad caught a gli
"mpse of her, she"
 seemed still mo
re lovely. She w
as a charming gi
"rl
of sixteen, "
evidently passio
nately in love w
ith him (he did 
not doubt that 
for an instant).
 Why should he n
"ot love her now,"
 and even marry 
"
her, Rostóv th"
"ought, but just "
now there were s
o many other ple
asures and inte
rests before him
"! “Yes, they h"
ave taken a wise
" decision,” he"
"
thought, “I "
must remain free
.”  “Well 
"then, that’s e"
"xcellent,” sai"
d he. “We’ll
 talk it over l
"ater on. Oh, how"
 glad I am to ha
ve you!”  �
"�Well, and are y"
ou still true to
 Borís?” he c
ontinued.  “
"Oh, what nonsens"
e!” cried Nat�
"�sha, laughing. "
“I don’t thi
nk about him or
" anyone else, an"
d I don’t want
 anything of the
 kind.”  “
Dear me! Then wh
at are you up to
 now?”  “N
ow?” repeated 
"Natásha, and a "
happy smile lit 
up her face. “
Have you seen D
uport?”  “
No.”  “Not
 seen Duport—t
he famous dancer
"? Well then, you"
 won’t unders
tand. That’s w
hat I’m up to.
”  Curving h
"er arms, Natásh"
a held out her s
kirts as dancers
" do, ran back
a"
" few steps, turn"
"ed, cut a caper,"
 brought her lit
tle feet sharply
"
together, and "
made some steps 
on the very tips
 of her toes.  
"
“See, I’m s"
tanding! See!”
" she said, but c"
ould not maintai
n herself on he
r toes any longe
r. “So that’
s what I’m up 
to! I’ll never
"
marry anyone, "
but will be a da
ncer. Only don�
�t tell anyone.�
��  Rostóv la
ughed so loud an
d merrily that D
"enísov, in his "
"bedroom, felt
e"
nvious and Natá
sha could not he
lp joining in. 
"
“No, but don"
’t you think i
t’s nice?” s
he kept repeatin
g.  “Nice! A
nd so you no lon
ger wish to marr
y Borís?”  
Natásha flared 
up. “I don’t
 want to marry a
nyone. And I’l
l tell him so w
hen I see him!�
�  “Dear me!
” said Rostóv
.  “But that
’s all rubbish
",” Natásha ch"
attered on. “A
nd is Denísov 
nice?” she ask
"ed.

“Yes, i"
ndeed!”  “
"Oh, well then, g"
ood-by: go and d
ress. Is he very
" terrible,
Den�"
�sov?”  “W
hy terrible?” 
asked Nicholas. 
"“No, Váska is"
 a splendid fel
low.”  “Yo
u call him Vásk
a? That’s funn
y! And is he ver
y nice?”  �
�Very.”  “
"Well then, be qu"
ick. We’ll all
 have breakfast 
together.”  
And Natásha ros
e and went out o
f the room on ti
"ptoe, like a bal"
"let
dancer, but"
 smiling as only
 happy girls of 
fifteen can smil
e. When Rostóv
 met Sónya in t
"he drawing room,"
 he reddened. He
 did not know h
ow to behave wit
h her. The eveni
"ng before, in th"
e first happy mo
ment of meeting
", they had kisse"
"d each other, bu"
t today they fel
t it could not 
be done; he felt
" that everybody,"
 including his m
other and sister
"s, was
looking "
inquiringly at h
im and watching 
to see how he wo
uld behave with
 her. He kissed 
her hand and add
ressed her not a
s thou but as y
ou—Sónya. But
 their eyes met 
"and said thou, a"
nd exchanged ten
der kisses. Her
 looks asked him
 to forgive her 
for having dared
", by
Natásha�"
"�s intermediacy,"
 to remind him o
"f his promise, a"
nd then thanked
 him for his lov
e. His looks tha
nked her for off
ering him his f
reedom and told 
her that one way
 or another he w
ould never cease
" to
love her, f"
or that would be
 impossible.  
“How strange i
"t is,” said V�"
"�ra, selecting a"
 moment when all
" were
silent, �"
��that Sónya an
d Nicholas now s
ay you to one an
other and meet 
like strangers.�
��  Véra’s 
remark was corre
"ct, as her remar"
"ks always were, "
"but, like
most "
of her observati
"ons, it made eve"
ryone feel uncom
"fortable, not
o"
"nly Sónya, Nich"
"olas, and Natás"
"ha, but even the"
" old countess,
"
who—dreading t
his love affair 
which might hind
er Nicholas from
 making a brill
iant match—blu
shed like a girl
".

Denísov, t"
o Rostóv’s su
"rprise, appeared"
 in the drawing 
room with pomad
"ed hair, perfume"
"d, and in a new "
"uniform, looking"
 just as smart a
s he made himse
lf when going in
"to battle, and h"
e was more amiab
le to the ladie
s and gentlemen 
than Rostóv had
 ever expected t
o see him.   
   CHAPTER II
  On his retur
n to Moscow from
" the army, Nicho"
las Rostóv was 
welcomed by his
 home circle as 
the best of sons
", a hero, and th"
eir darling Nik
ólenka; by his 
relations as a c
"harming, attract"
"ive, and polite "
young man; by h
is acquaintances
 as a handsome l
ieutenant of hus
"sars, a good
da"
"ncer, and one of"
 the best matche
s in the city. 
 The Rostóvs k
new everybody in
 Moscow. The old
 count had money
 enough that ye
"ar, as all his e"
states had been 
"remortgaged, and"
" so Nicholas,
a"
cquiring a trott
"er of his own, v"
ery stylish ridi
ng breeches of t
"he
latest cut, "
such as no one e
lse yet had in M
"oscow, and boots"
 of the latest 
"fashion, with ex"
tremely pointed 
toes and small s
"ilver spurs,
pa"
ssed his time ve
ry gaily. After 
a short period o
f adapting himse
lf to the old c
onditions of lif
"e, Nicholas foun"
d it very pleasa
nt to be at hom
e again. He felt
 that he had gro
wn up and mature
d very much. His
 despair at fai
ling in a Script
"ure examination,"
 his borrowing m
oney from Gavr�
�l to pay a slei
"gh driver, his k"
issing Sónya on
 the sly—he no
w recalled all 
this as childish
ness he had left
 immeasurably be
hind. Now he wa
s a lieutenant o
"f hussars, in a "
jacket laced wit
"h silver, and
w"
earing the Cross
" of St. George, "
awarded to soldi
ers for bravery 
"in
action, and "
in the company o
"f well-known, el"
"derly, and respe"
cted racing men
 was training a 
trotter of his o
wn for a race. H
e knew a lady on
 one of the bou
levards whom he 
visited of an ev
ening. He led th
e mazurka at th
e Arkhárovs’ 
"ball, talked abo"
ut the war with 
Field Marshal K
"ámenski, visite"
d the English Cl
"ub, and was on i"
ntimate terms wi
th a colonel of
 forty to whom D
enísov had intr
oduced him.  H
is passion for t
he Emperor had c
ooled somewhat i
n Moscow. But st
"ill, as
he did "
not see him and 
had no opportuni
ty of seeing him
", he often spoke"
 about him and 
about his love f
"or him, letting "
it be understood
 that he had no
t told all and t
hat there was so
mething in his f
eelings for the 
 Emperor not eve
ryone could unde
"rstand, and with"
 his whole soul 
he shared the a
doration then co
mmon in Moscow f
"or the Emperor, "
who was spoken o
f as the “ang
el incarnate.”
  During Rost�
�v’s short sta
"y in Moscow, bef"
ore rejoining th
"e army, he
did "
not draw closer 
"to Sónya, but r"
ather drifted aw
ay from her. She
 was very prett
"y and sweet, and"
 evidently deepl
y in love with h
"im, but he was
"
at the period of
 youth when ther
e seems so much 
to do that there
 is no time for
 that sort of th
ing and a young 
man fears to bin
d himself and p
rizes his freedo
m which he needs
 for so many oth
er things. When 
he thought of S
"ónya, during th"
is stay in Mosco
"w, he said to hi"
"mself,
“Ah, t"
"here will be, an"
"d there are, man"
y more such girl
s somewhere whom
 I do not yet k
now. There will 
be time enough t
o think about lo
ve when I want 
"to, but now I ha"
ve no time.” B
"esides, it seeme"
d to him that th
e society of wo
men was rather d
erogatory to his
 manhood. He wen
t to balls and 
into ladies’ s
ociety with an a
ffectation of do
ing so against h
is will. The ra
"ces, the English"
" Club, sprees wi"
"th Denísov, and"
 visits to a ce
rtain house—th
at was another m
atter and quite 
the thing for a 
 dashing young h
ussar!  At the
 beginning of Ma
"rch, old Count I"
lyá Rostóv was
 very busy arra
nging a dinner i
n honor of Princ
e Bagratión at 
the English Club
.  The count w
alked up and dow
n the hall in hi
"s dressing gown,"
 giving orders 
to the club stew
ard and to the f
"amous Feoktíst,"
 the club’s h
"ead cook, about "
"asparagus, fresh"
" cucumbers, stra"
"wberries, veal, "
and fish for th
is dinner. The c
ount had been a 
member and on th
e committee of 
the club from th
e day it was fou
nded. To him the
 club entrusted 
the arrangement
 of the festival
 in honor of Bag
"ratión, for few"
 men knew so we
ll how to arrang
e a feast on an 
"open-handed, hos"
"pitable scale,
"
and still fewer 
men would be so 
well able and wi
lling to make up
 out of their o
wn resources wha
t might be neede
d for the succes
s of the fete. 
The club cook an
d the steward li
stened to the co
unt’s orders w
ith pleased fac
"es, for they kne"
w that under no 
other management
 could they so 
easily extract a
 good profit for
 themselves from
 a dinner costin
g several thous
and rubles.  �
"��Well then, min"
d and have cocks
’ comb in the 
"turtle soup, you"
 know!”  �
�Shall we have t
hree cold dishes
 then?” asked 
the cook.  The
 count considere
d.  “We can�
��t have less—
"yes, three... th"
"e mayonnaise, th"
"at’s one,”
"
"said he, bending"
 down a finger. 
  “Then am I 
to order those l
arge sterlets?�
� asked the stew
"ard.

“Yes, "
it can’t be he
lped if they won
’t take less. 
"Ah, dear me! I
"
was forgetting. 
We must have ano
ther entrée. Ah
", goodness graci"
ous!” he clut
ched at his head
. “Who is goin
g to get me the 
flowers? Dmítri
"!
Eh, Dmítri! "
Gallop off to ou
"r Moscow estate,"
” he said to t
he factotum who
 appeared at his
 call. “Hurry 
off and tell Mak
"sím, the garden"
"er,
to set the "
serfs to work. S
ay that everythi
ng out of the ho
thouses must be
 brought here we
ll wrapped up in
 felt. I must ha
ve two hundred p
ots here on Fri
day.”  Havin
g given several 
"more orders, he "
was about to go 
to his “little
 countess” to
" have a rest, bu"
t remembering so
mething else of 
"
importance, he "
"returned again, "
called back the 
cook and the clu
"b
steward, and "
again began givi
ng orders. A lig
ht footstep and 
the clinking of
 spurs were hear
"d at the door, a"
nd the young cou
"nt, handsome,
r"
"osy, with a dark"
 little mustache
", evidently rest"
ed and made slee
ker by his easy
" life in Moscow,"
 entered the roo
"m.

“Ah, my "
"boy, my head’s"
 in a whirl!” 
said the old man
" with a smile,
"
as if he felt a 
little confused 
before his son. 
"“Now, if you w"
ould only help 
a bit! I must ha
ve singers too. 
I shall have my 
"own orchestra,
"
but shouldn’t 
we get the gypsy
 singers as well
? You military m
en like that so
rt of thing.” 
"

“Really, Pa"
"pa, I believe Pr"
ince Bagratión 
worried himself 
less before the
 battle of Schö
n Grabern than y
"ou do now,” sa"
id his son with 
a smile.  The
 old count prete
nded to be angry
".

“Yes, you"
" talk, but try i"
t yourself!” 
 And the count 
turned to the co
"ok, who, with a "
shrewd and respe
ctful expressio
"n, looked observ"
antly and sympat
hetically at the
 father and son
.  “What hav
e the young peop
le come to nowad
"ays, eh, Feoktí"
st?” said he.
 “Laughing at 
us old fellows!�
��  “That’
"s so, your excel"
"lency, all they "
have to do is to
 eat a good din
"ner, but providi"
ng it and servin
"g it all up, tha"
t’s not their 
 business!”  
"
“That’s it,"
 that’s it!”
 exclaimed the c
"ount, and gaily "
seizing his son
" by both hands, "
"he cried, “Now"
" I’ve got you,"
 so take the sl
eigh and pair at
" once, and go to"
" Bezúkhov’s, "
and tell him ‘
Count Ilyá has
 sent you to ask
 for strawberrie
s and fresh pine
apples.’ We c
an’t get them 
from anyone else
. He’s not the
"re himself, so y"
ou’ll have to
 go in and ask t
he princesses; a
nd from there go
 on to the Rasg
ulyáy—the coa
chman Ipátka kn
ows—and look u
p the gypsy Ily
"úshka, the one "
who danced at Co
"unt Orlóv’s, "
"you remember, in"
 a white Cossac
"k coat, and brin"
g him along to m
e.”  “And 
am I to bring th
e gypsy girls al
ong with him?”
" asked Nicholas,"
 laughing. “D
"ear, dear!...”"
  At that mome
"nt, with noisele"
ss footsteps and
 with the busine
"sslike,
preoccu"
"pied, yet meekly"
 Christian look 
which never left
" her face, Anna"
 Mikháylovna en
tered the hall. 
Though she came 
upon the count i
n his dressing 
"gown every day, "
he invariably be
came confused an
d begged her to 
 excuse his cost
ume.  “No ma
"tter at all, my "
"dear count,” s"
"he said, meekly "
closing her eye
s. “But I’ll
 go to Bezúkhov
’s myself. Pie
"rre has arrived,"
 and now we sha
ll get anything 
we want from his
 hothouses. I ha
ve to see him i
n any case. He h
as forwarded me 
a letter from Bo
"rís. Thank God,"
 Borís is now 
on the staff.”
  The count wa
s delighted at A
nna Mikháylovna
’s taking upon
 herself one of
 his commissions
 and ordered the
 small closed ca
rriage for her. 
  “Tell Bezú
khov to come. I�
��ll put his nam
e down. Is his w
ife with him?�
� he asked.  A
nna Mikháylovna
 turned up her e
"yes, and profoun"
d sadness was de
picted on her f
"ace.

“Ah, m"
"y dear friend, h"
e is very unfort
"unate,” she sa"
id. “If what 
"we hear is true,"
 it is dreadful.
 How little we d
reamed of such a
 thing when we 
were rejoicing a
t his happiness!
 And such a loft
y angelic soul 
as young Bezúkh
"ov! Yes, I pity "
him from my hear
"t, and shall try"
 to give him wh
at consolation I
 can.”  “W
h-what is the ma
tter?” asked b
oth the young an
d old Rostóv. 
 Anna Mikháylo
vna sighed deepl
y.  “Dólokh
"ov, Mary Ivánov"
"na’s son,” s"
he said in a mys
terious whisper
", “has comprom"
ised her complet

ierre took him 
"up, invited him "
to his house in 
"Petersburg, and "
now... she has c
ome here and th

er her!” said 
Anna Mikháylovn
"a, wishing to sh"
ow her sympathy
" for Pierre, but"
 by involuntary 
intonations and 
a half smile be
traying her symp
athy for the “
"daredevil,” as"
 she called Dól

say Pierre is qu

"

“Dear, dea"
r! But still tel
l him to come to
 the club—it w
ill all blow ov

 tremendous banq
uet.”  Next 
"day, the third o"
"f March, soon af"
ter one o’cloc
"k, two hundred a"

hat on receiving
 news of the def
eat some would s
imply not believ
"e it,
while oth"
ers sought some 
extraordinary ex
planation of so 
strange an even
t. In the Englis
"h Club, where al"
l who were disti
"nguished, import"
"ant,
and well i"
nformed foregath
ered when the ne
ws began to arri
"ve in
December,"
 nothing was sai
d about the war 
and the last bat
"tle, as
though "
all were in a co
nspiracy of sile
nce. The men who
 set the tone i
n conversation�
�Count Rostopch�
"�n, Prince Yúri"
" Dolgorúkov, Va"
"lúev,
Count Ma"
"rkóv, and Princ"
e Vyázemski—d
id not show them
selves at the c
"lub, but met in "
private houses i
n intimate circl
"es, and the
Mos"
covites who took
 their opinions 
from others—Il
yá Rostóv amon
g them—remain
ed for a while w
ithout any defin
ite opinion on t
he subject of t
he war and witho
ut leaders. The 
Moscovites felt 
that something w
as wrong and th
at to discuss th
e bad news was d
"ifficult, and so"
 it was best to
 be silent. But 
"after a while, j"
ust as a jury co
mes out of its r
"oom,
the bigwig"
s who guided the
 club’s opinio
"n reappeared, an"
d everybody beg
an speaking clea
rly and definite
ly. Reasons were
 found for the 
"incredible, unhe"
"ard-of, and impo"
ssible event of 
a Russian defeat
",
everything be"
"came clear, and "
in all corners o
f Moscow the sam
e things began 
to be said. Thes
e reasons were t
he treachery of 
"the Austrians, a"
 defective comm
"issariat, the tr"
eachery of the P
ole Przebyszéws
ki and of the F
renchman Langero
"n, Kutúzov’s "
"incapacity, and "
(it was whispere
d) the youth an
d inexperience o
"f the sovereign,"
 who had trusted
 worthless and 
insignificant pe
ople. But the ar
"my, the Russian "
"army, everyone
"
"declared, was ex"
traordinary and 
had achieved mir
acles of valor. 
"The
soldiers, o"
"fficers, and gen"
erals were heroe
s. But the hero 
of heroes was P
rince Bagratión
", distinguished "
by his Schön Gr
abern affair and
 by the retreat
 from Austerlitz
", where he alone"
 had withdrawn h
is column unbro
ken and had all 
day beaten back 
an enemy force t
wice as numerous
 as his own. Wh
at also conduced
 to Bagratión�
�s being selecte
d as Moscow’s
 hero was the fa
ct that he had n
o connections in
 the city and w
as a stranger th
ere. In his pers
"on, honor was sh"
own to a simple 
 fighting Russia
n soldier withou
t connections an
"d intrigues, and"
 to one who was
 associated by m
emories of the I
talian campaign 
with the name of
 Suvórov. More
"over, paying suc"
h honor to Bagra
tión was the be
st way of expre
ssing disapprova
l and dislike of
 Kutúzov.  �
�Had there been 
"no Bagratión, i"
t would have bee
n necessary to 
"invent him,” s"
aid the wit Shin
"shín, parodying"
 the words of Vo
ltaire. Kutúzo
v no one spoke o
"f, except some w"
ho abused him in
" whispers,
call"
ing him a court 
weathercock and 
an old satyr.  
 All Moscow repe
ated Prince Dolg
orúkov’s sayi
ng: “If you go
 on modeling an
d modeling you m
ust get smeared 
"with clay,” su"
ggesting consol
ation for our de

ry of former vic
tories; and the 
 words of Rostop
"chín, that Fren"
ch soldiers have
 to be incited t
o battle by hig
"hfalutin words, "
and Germans by l
ogical arguments
 to show them t
hat it is more d
angerous to run 
away than to adv
"ance, but that R"
ussian soldiers
 only need to be
 restrained and 
held back! On al
"l sides, new and"
 fresh anecdote
s were heard of 
individual examp
les of heroism s
hown by our off
icers and men at
 Austerlitz. One
 had saved a sta
"ndard, another
"
had killed five 
"Frenchmen, a thi"
rd had loaded fi
ve cannon single
handed. Berg wa
"s mentioned, by "
those who did no
"t know him, as h"
"aving, when
wou"
nded in the righ
"t hand, taken hi"
s sword in the l
"eft, and gone
f"
orward. Of Bolk�
"�nski, nothing w"
"as said, and onl"
y those who knew
 him intimately
 regretted that 
he had died so y
"oung, leaving a "
pregnant wife w
ith his eccentri
c father.    
   CHAPTER III
  On that thir
"d of March, all "
the rooms in the
 English Club we
re filled with 
a hum of convers
"ation, like the "
hum of bees swar
ming in springti
me. The members
 and guests of t
he club wandered
 hither and thit
"her, sat,
stood"
", met, and separ"
"ated, some in un"
iform and some i
"n evening dress,"
 and a few here
 and there with 
powdered hair an
d in Russian kaf
táns. Powdered
" footmen, in liv"
ery with buckled
 shoes and smart
" stockings,
sto"
od at every door
 anxiously notin
g visitors’ ev
ery movement in 
order to offer 
their services. 
Most of those pr
esent were elder
"ly, respected
m"
"en with broad, s"
elf-confident fa
"ces, fat fingers"
", and resolute g"
estures and voi
ces. This class 
of guests and me
mbers sat in cer
tain habitual p
laces and met in
 certain habitua
l groups. A mino
rity of those pr
esent were casu
al guests—chie
"fly young men, a"
mong whom were D
"enísov,
Rostó"
"v, and Dólokhov"
—who was now a
gain an officer 
in the Semënov 
 regiment. The f
aces of these yo
"ung people, espe"
cially those who
 were military 
"men, bore that e"
xpression of con
descending respe
ct for their el
ders which seems
 to say to the o
"lder generation,"
 “We are prepa
red to respect 
"and honor you, b"
ut all the same 
remember that th
e future belongs
 to us.”  N
esvítski was th
ere as an old me
mber of the club
". Pierre, who at"
 his wife’s c
ommand had let h
is hair grow and
 abandoned his s
"pectacles,
went"
 about the rooms
 fashionably dre
ssed but looking
 sad and dull. H
"ere,
as elsewhe"
"re, he was surro"
unded by an atmo
sphere of subser
vience to his w
"ealth, and being"
 in the habit of
 lording it over
" these people, h"
e treated them 
with absent-mind
ed contempt.  
By his age he sh
ould have belong
ed to the younge
"r men, but by hi"
s wealth and co
nnections he bel
onged to the gro
ups of old and h
"onored guests, a"
nd so he went f
rom one group to
 another. Some o
f the most impor
tant old men we
re the center of
 groups which ev
en strangers app
roached respectf
ully to hear th
e voices of well
-known men. The 
largest circles 
formed round Co
"unt Rostopchín,"
" Valúev, and Na"
rýshkin. Rostop
chín was descri
bing how the Ru
ssians had been 
overwhelmed by f
lying Austrians 
and had had to 
force their way 
through them wit
h bayonets.  V
alúev was confi
dentially tellin
g that Uvárov h
ad been sent fro
m Petersburg to
 ascertain what 
Moscow was think
ing about Auster
litz.  In the 
"third circle, Na"
rýshkin was spe
aking of the mee
ting of the Aus
trian Council of
 War at which Su
vórov crowed li
ke a cock in rep
ly to the nonse
nse talked by th
e Austrian gener
"als. Shinshín, "
standing close 
"by, tried to mak"
"e a joke, saying"
 that Kutúzov h
ad evidently fai
led to learn fr
om Suvórov even
 so simple a thi
ng as the art of
 crowing like a 
"
cock, but the e"
lder members gla
nced severely at
" the wit, making"
 him feel that 
in that place an
"d on that day, i"
t was improper t
o speak so of K
utúzov.  Coun
"t Ilyá Rostóv,"
 hurried and pre
"occupied, went a"
bout in his soft
 boots between 
the dining and d
"rawing rooms, ha"
stily greeting t
he important an
"d unimportant, a"
ll of whom he kn
"ew, as if they w"
"ere all
equals,"
 while his eyes 
occasionally sou
ght out his fine
 well-set-up yo
"ung son, resting"
 on him and wink
ing joyfully at 
him. Young Rost�
�v stood at a w
indow with Dólo
"khov, whose acqu"
aintance he had 
lately made and
 highly valued. 
The old count ca
me up to them an
d pressed Dólo
khov’s hand. 
 “Please come
 and visit us...
 you know my bra
ve boy... been t
ogether out the
re... both playi
ng the hero... A
"h, Vasíli Igná"
tovich... How d
"’ye do, old fe"
llow?” he said
", turning to an "
old man who was 
"
passing, but be"
fore he had fini
shed his greetin
g there was a ge
"neral
stir, and"
 a footman who h
ad run in announ
"ced, with a frig"
htened face: �
�He’s arrived!
”  Bells ran
"g, the stewards "
"rushed forward, "
and—like rye s
haken together 
in a shovel—th
e guests who had
 been scattered 
about in differe
nt rooms came t
ogether and crow
ded in the large
 drawing room by
 the door of the
 ballroom.  B
agratión appear
ed in the doorwa
y of the anteroo
m without hat or
" sword,
which, "
in accord with t
"he club custom, "
he had given up 
to the hall por
ter. He had no l
ambskin cap on h
"is head, nor had"
 he a loaded whi
p over his shou
"lder, as when Ro"
stóv had seen h
im on the eve of
 the battle of 
"Austerlitz, but "
wore a tight new
 uniform with Ru
ssian and foreig
"n
Orders, and t"
he Star of St. G
eorge on his lef
t breast. Eviden
tly just before
 coming to the d
inner he had had
 his hair and wh
"iskers trimmed,"
 which changed h
is appearance fo
r the worse. The
re was something
 naïvely festi
"ve in his air, w"
"hich, in conjunc"
tion with his fi
rm and virile f
"eatures, gave hi"
m a rather comic
al expression. B
ekleshëv and Th
"eodore
Uvárov,"
 who had arrived
" with him, pause"
d at the doorway
" to allow him,
"
as the guest of 
"honor, to enter "
first. Bagratió
n was embarrasse
"d, not
wishing "
to avail himself
 of their courte
"sy, and this cau"
sed some delay 
"at the doors, bu"
t after all he d
id at last enter
 first. He walke
d shyly and awk
wardly over the 
parquet floor of
 the reception r
"oom, not knowing"
 what to do wit
h his hands; he 
was more accusto
med to walk over
 a plowed field
" under fire, as "
he had done at t
he head of the K
ursk regiment at
 Schön Grabern
—and he would 
have found that 
easier. The comm
itteemen met hi
m at the first d
"oor and, express"
ing their deligh
t at seeing such
 a highly honor
"ed guest, took p"
ossession of him
" as it were, wit"
hout waiting fo
"r his reply, sur"
"rounded him, and"
 led him to the 
drawing room. It
 was at first i
mpossible to ent
er the drawing r
oom door for the
 crowd of membe
rs and guests jo
stling one anoth
er and trying to
 get a good look
 at Bagratión 
over each other�
"��s shoulders, a"
s if he were som
e rare animal. 
Count Ilyá Rost
"óv, laughing an"
d repeating the 
"words, “Make
"
"way, dear boy! M"
"ake way, make wa"
y!” pushed thr
ough the crowd m
ore energetical
"ly than anyone, "
led the guests i
nto the drawing 
"room, and
seate"
d them on the ce
nter sofa. The b
"igwigs, the most"
 respected membe
"rs
of the club,"
 beset the new a
rrivals. Count I
"lyá, again thru"
sting his way t
hrough the crowd
", went out of th"
e drawing room a
nd reappeared a 
 minute later wi
th another commi
"tteeman, carryin"
g a large silver
 salver which h
e presented to P
rince Bagratión
. On the salver 
lay some verses 
 composed and pr
inted in the her
o’s honor. Bag
"ratión, on seei"
"ng the
salver, "
glanced around i
"n dismay, as tho"
ugh seeking help
. But all eyes 
demanded that he
 should submit. 
Feeling himself 
"in their power, "
he resolutely t
ook the salver w
ith both hands a
nd looked sternl
y and reproachf
ully at the coun
t who had presen
ted it to him. S
omeone obliging
ly took the dish
 from Bagratión
" (or he would, i"
"t seemed, have
"
held it till eve
ning and have go
ne in to dinner 
with it) and dre
w his attention
 to the verses. 
"

“Well, I wi"
"ll read them, th"
en!” Bagratió
"n seemed to say,"
" and,
fixing hi"
s weary eyes on 
"the paper, began"
 to read them wi
th a fixed and 
serious expressi
on. But the auth
or himself took 
the verses and b
egan reading th
em aloud. Bagrat
ión bowed his h
ead and listened
:     Bring gl
ory then to Alex
ander’s reign 
    And on the t
hrone our Titus 
shield.    A dr
eaded foe be tho
"u, kindhearted a"
"s a man,
   A R"
"hipheus at home,"
 a Caesar in the
 field!    E’
en fortunate Nap
oleon    Knows 
"by experience, n"
"ow, Bagratión,"
    And dare not
 Herculean Russi
ans trouble... 
 But before he 
had finished rea
"ding, a stentori"
an major-domo an
nounced that di
nner was ready! 
"The door opened,"
 and from the di
ning room came 
the resounding s
trains of the po
lonaise:     C
onquest’s joyf
ul thunder waken
",
   Triumph, v"
"aliant Russians,"
 now!...  and 
"Count Rostóv, g"
lancing angrily 
at the author wh
o went on readin
"g
his verses, b"
owed to Bagrati�
�n. Everyone ros
"e, feeling that "
dinner was more
 important than 
"verses, and Bagr"
"atión, again pr"
eceding all the 
"
rest, went in t"
o dinner. He was
 seated in the p
lace of honor be
tween two Alexa
nders—Beklesh�
�v and Narýshki
n—which was a 
significant all
usion to the nam
e of the soverei
gn. Three hundre
d persons took t
heir seats in t
"he dining room, "
according to the
ir rank and impo
rtance: the mor
e important near
er to the honore
"d guest, as natu"
rally as water f
lows deepest wh
ere the land lie
s lowest.  Jus
"t before dinner,"
 Count Ilyá Ros
tóv presented h
is son to Bagrat
"ión,
who recog"
nized him and sa
id a few words t
"o him, disjointe"
"d and awkward,
"
as were all the 
words he spoke t
"hat day, and Cou"
nt Ilyá looked 
joyfully and pr
oudly around whi
le Bagratión sp
oke to his son. 
  Nicholas Rost
"óv, with Denís"
ov and his new a
"cquaintance, Dó"
"lokhov, sat
alm"
ost at the middl
e of the table. 
Facing them sat 
"Pierre, beside P"
rince Nesvítsk
i. Count Ilyá R
ostóv with the 
other members of
 the committee 
sat facing Bagra
"tión and, as th"
e very personifi
cation of Moscow
"
hospitality, d"
id the honors to
 the prince.  
His efforts had 
not been in vain
". The dinner, bo"
th the Lenten an
d the other far
"e, was splendid,"
 yet he could no
t feel quite at 
ease till the e
nd of the meal. 
He winked at the
" butler, whisper"
ed directions to
" the
footmen, a"
nd awaited each 
expected dish wi
th some anxiety.
 Everything was
 excellent. With
 the second cour
"se, a gigantic s"
terlet (at sight
 of which Ilyá
 Rostóv blushed
 with self-consc
"ious pleasure), "
the footmen beg
an popping corks
 and filling the
 champagne glass
es. After the fi
"sh,
which made "
a certain sensat
"ion, the count e"
xchanged glances
 with the other
 committeemen. �
��There will be 
"many toasts, it�"
��s time to beg
"in,” he whispe"
"red, and taking "
"up his glass, he"
 rose. All were 
"
silent, waiting"
 for what he wou
ld say.  “To
 the health of o
"ur Sovereign, th"
e Emperor!” he
" cried, and at t"
he same moment 
his kindly eyes 
grew moist with 
tears of joy and
 enthusiasm. Th
e band immediate
ly struck up “
Conquest’s joy
ful thunder wak
en...” All ros
e and cried “H
urrah!” Bagrat
ión also rose a
nd shouted “H
urrah!” in exa
ctly the same vo
ice in which he 
had shouted it 
on the field at 
Schön Grabern. 
Young Rostóv’
s ecstatic voice
 could be heard
 above the three
 hundred others.
 He nearly wept.
 “To the heal
th of our Sovere
"ign, the Emperor"
"!” he roared, "
“Hurrah!” an
d emptying his 
glass at one gul
p he dashed it t
o the floor. Man
y followed his 
"example, and the"
 loud shouting c
ontinued for a l
ong time. When t
he voices subsi
"ded, the footmen"
 cleared away th
e broken glass a
nd everybody sa
"t down again, sm"
iling at the noi
se they had made
 and exchanging 
 remarks. The ol
d count rose onc
"e more, glanced "
at a note lying 
beside his plat
"e, and proposed "
"a toast, “To t"
he health of the
 hero of our la
"st campaign, Pri"
nce Peter Iváno
vich Bagratión!
” and again hi
s blue eyes gre
w moist. “Hurr
ah!” cried the
 three hundred v
"oices again,
bu"
t instead of the
 band a choir be
gan singing a ca
ntata composed b
y Paul Ivánovi
ch Kutúzov:  
   Russians! O�
�er all barriers
 on!    Courage
 conquest guaran
tees;    Have w
e not Bagratión
?    He brings 
foemen to their 
"knees,... etc.
"
 As soon as the
 singing was ove
"r, another and a"
nother toast was
 proposed and C
ount Ilyá Rost�
�v became more a
"nd more moved, m"
ore glass was s
"mashed, and the "
shouting grew lo
uder. They drank
" to Bekleshëv,"
"
Narýshkin, Uv�"
"�rov, Dolgorúko"
"v, Apráksin, Va"
"lúev, to the co"
"mmittee,
to all"
 the club member
s and to all the
" club guests, an"
d finally to Co
unt Ilyá Rostó
"v separately, as"
 the organizer o
f the banquet. A
"t that
toast, t"
he count took ou
t his handkerchi
"ef and, covering"
" his face, wept"
 outright.   
   CHAPTER IV
  Pierre sat o
pposite Dólokho
v and Nicholas R
ostóv. As usual
", he ate and
dr"
"ank much, and ea"
gerly. But those
 who knew him in
timately noticed
 that some grea
t change had com
e over him that 
day. He was sile
nt all through 
dinner and looke
"d about, blinkin"
"g and scowling, "
"or, with fixed e"
yes and a look 
of complete abse
"nt-mindedness, k"
ept rubbing the 
bridge of his n
ose. His face wa
s depressed and 
gloomy. He seeme
d to see and hea
r nothing of wh
at was going on 
around him and t
o be absorbed by
 some depressin
g and unsolved p
roblem.  The u
nsolved problem 
that tormented h
im was caused by
 hints given by 
"the
princess, h"
"is cousin, at Mo"
"scow, concerning"
 Dólokhov’s i
ntimacy with hi
"s wife, and by a"
n anonymous lett
er he had receiv
"ed that morning,"
 which in the m
ean jocular way 
common to anonym
ous letters said
 that he saw ba
dly through his 
"spectacles, but "
that his wife’
s connection wit
h Dólokhov was
 a secret to no 
one but himself.
 Pierre absolute
ly disbelieved 
both the princes
s’ hints and t
"he letter, but h"
e feared now to
 look at Dólokh
"ov, who was sitt"
ing opposite him
. Every time he
 chanced to meet
 Dólokhov’s h
andsome insolent
" eyes, Pierre fe"
lt something te
rrible and monst
rous rising in h
is soul and turn
ed quickly away
. Involuntarily 
recalling his wi
fe’s past and 
her relations wi
"th
Dólokhov, P"
ierre saw clearl
y that what was 
said in the lett
er might be tru
"e, or might at l"
east seem to be 
true had it not 
referred to his 
wife. He involu
ntarily remember
ed how Dólokhov
", who had fully "
recovered his f
ormer position a
fter the campaig
"n, had returned "
to Petersburg an
d come to him. 
Availing himself
 of his friendly
 relations with 
Pierre as a boon
"
companion, Dó"
lokhov had come 
straight to his 
"house, and Pierr"
e had put him u
p and lent him m
oney. Pierre rec
alled how Hélè
ne had smilingly
 expressed disa
pproval of Dólo
khov’s living 
"at their house, "
and how cynical
ly Dólokhov had
 praised his wif
e’s beauty to 
him and from tha
t time till the
y came to Moscow
 had not left th
em for a day.  
"
“Yes, he is v"
"ery handsome,”"
" thought Pierre,"
 “and I know h
im. It would be
 particularly pl
easant to him to
 dishonor my nam
e and ridicule 
"me, just because"
 I have exerted 
myself on his be
"half, befriended"
" him,
and helpe"
d him. I know an
d understand wha
t a spice that w
ould add to the 
 pleasure of dec
"eiving me, if it"
 really were tru
"e. Yes, if it we"
"re true,
but I "
do not believe i
t. I have no rig
"ht to, and can�"
"�t, believe it.�"
�� He remembere
d the expression
 Dólokhov’s f
ace assumed in h
is moments of c
"ruelty, as when "
tying the police
man to the bear 
and dropping the
m into the wate
"r, or when he ch"
allenged a man t
o a duel without
" any
reason, or"
 shot a post-boy
’s horse with 
a pistol. That e
xpression was o
ften on Dólokho
v’s face when 
looking at him. 
"“Yes, he is a"
"
bully,” thoug"
"ht Pierre, “to"
 kill a man mean
s nothing to him
. It must seem 
to him that ever
yone is afraid o
"f him, and that "
must please him.
 He must think 
"that I, too, am "
afraid of him—
and in fact I am
" afraid of
him,"
"” he thought, "
and again he fel
t something terr
ible and monstro
us rising in hi
s soul. Dólokho
"v, Denísov, and"
 Rostóv were no
w sitting oppos
ite Pierre and s
eemed very gay. 
Rostóv was talk
ing merrily to h
"is
two friends,"
 one of whom was
 a dashing hussa
r and the other 
a notorious due
"list and rake, a"
nd every now and
 then he glanced
 ironically at 
"Pierre, whose pr"
"eoccupied, absen"
"t-minded, and ma"
ssive figure was
 a very noticea
ble one at the d
inner. Rostóv l
ooked inimically
" at Pierre,
fir"
st because Pierr
e appeared to hi
s hussar eyes as
 a rich civilian
", the
husband o"
"f a beauty, and "
in a word—an o
ld woman; and se
condly because 
Pierre in his pr
eoccupation and 
absent-mindednes
s had not recogn
ized Rostóv an
d had not respon
ded to his greet
ing. When the Em
peror’s healt
"h was drunk, Pie"
"rre, lost in tho"
"ught, did not ri"
se or lift his 
glass.  “Wha
t are you about?
” shouted Rost
"óv, looking at "
him in an ecstas
y of exasperati
on. “Don’t y
ou hear it’s H
is Majesty the E
mperor’s heal
th?”  Pierre
" sighed, rose su"
"bmissively, empt"
"ied his glass, a"
"nd, waiting till"
 all were seate
"d again, turned "
with his kindly 
smile to Rostóv
".

“Why, I d"
idn’t recogniz
e you!” he sai
d. But Rostóv w
as otherwise en
gaged; he was sh
outing “Hurrah
!”  “Why d
on’t you renew
 the acquaintanc
e?” said Dólo
khov to Rostóv.
  “Confound 
"him, he’s a fo"
ol!” said Rost
óv.  “One s
hould make up to
 the husbands of
" pretty women,�"
� said Denísov.
  Pierre did n
ot catch what th
"ey were saying, "
but knew they we
re talking abou
t him. He redden
ed and turned aw
"ay.

“Well, "
now to the healt
h of handsome wo
men!” said Dó
"lokhov, and
wit"
h a serious expr
"ession, but with"
 a smile lurking
 at the corners 
"of
his mouth, h"
e turned with hi
s glass to Pierr
e.  “Here’
s to the health 
"of lovely women,"
 Peterkin—and 
their lovers!�
� he added.  P
"ierre, with down"
"cast eyes, drank"
 out of his glas
s without lookin
g at Dólokhov 
or answering him
". The footman, w"
ho was distribut
ing leaflets wi
th Kutúzov’s 
"cantata, laid on"
e before Pierre 
as one of the p
rincipal guests.
 He was just goi
ng to take it wh
"en Dólokhov, le"
"aning
across, s"
natched it from 
his hand and beg
an reading it. P
ierre looked at
 Dólokhov and h
"is eyes dropped,"
 the something t
errible and mons
trous that had 
tormented him al
l dinnertime ros
e and took posse
ssion of him. H
e leaned his who
le massive body 
across the table
.  “How dare
 you take it?”
 he shouted.  
Hearing that cry
 and seeing to w
hom it was addre
"ssed, Nesvítski"
 and the neighb
or on his right 
quickly turned i
n alarm to Bezú
khov.  “Don�
��t! Don’t! Wh
at are you about
?” whispered t
heir frightened 
 voices.  Dól
okhov looked at 
Pierre with clea
"r, mirthful, cru"
"el eyes, and tha"
t smile of his 
which seemed to 
"say, “Ah! This"
 is what I like!
”  “You sh
an’t have it!�
�� he said disti
"nctly.

Pale, "
with quivering l
"ips, Pierre snat"
ched the copy. 
 “You...! you
... scoundrel! I
 challenge you!�
�� he ejaculated
", and,
pushing "
"back his chair, "
he rose from the
 table.  At th
e very instant h
e did this and u
ttered those wor
"ds, Pierre felt"
 that the questi
on of his wife�
�s guilt which h
ad been tormenti
ng him the whol
e day was finall
y and indubitabl
y answered in th
e affirmative. 
He hated her and
 was forever sun
dered from her. 
Despite Denísov
’s request th
at he would take
 no part in the 
"matter, Rostóv "
agreed to be D�
�lokhov’s seco
"nd, and after di"
nner he discusse
d the arrangemen
ts for the duel
 with Nesvítski
", Bezúkhov’s "
second. Pierre w
"ent home, but
R"
ostóv with Dól
okhov and Denís
ov stayed on at 
the club till la
"te,
listening t"
o the gypsies an
d other singers.
  “Well then
", till tomorrow "
"at Sokólniki,�"
� said Dólokhov
", as he took
le"
ave of Rostóv i
n the club porch
.  “And do y
ou feel quite ca
lm?” Rostóv a
sked.  Dólokh
ov paused.  �
"�Well, you see, "
I’ll tell you 
the whole secret
 of dueling in t
wo words. If yo
u are going to f
"ight a duel, and"
 you make a will
 and write affe
ctionate letters
 to your parents
", and if you thi"
nk you may be k
"illed, you are a"
 fool and are lo
st for certain. 
But go with the 
firm intention 
of killing your 
man as quickly a
nd surely as pos
"sible, and
then"
 all will be rig
"ht, as our bear "
huntsman at Kost
romá used to te
ll me. ‘Every
one fears a bear
",’ he says, �"
�but when you se
e one your fear
"’s all gone, a"
nd your only tho
ught is not to l
et him get away!
’ And that’
s how it is with
" me. À demain, "
mon cher.” * 
     * Till tom
"orrow, my dear f"
ellow.  Next d
"ay, at eight in "
"the morning, Pie"
rre and Nesvíts
ki drove to the 
 Sokólniki fore
st and found Dó
"lokhov, Denísov"
", and Rostóv al"
ready there. Pi
erre had the air
 of a man preocc
upied with consi
derations which 
 had no connecti
on with the matt
er in hand. His 
haggard face was
 yellow. He had
 evidently not s
lept that night.
 He looked about
 distractedly an
d screwed up hi
s eyes as if daz
zled by the sun.
 He was entirely
 absorbed by tw
o considerations
: his wife’s g
"uilt, of which a"
fter his sleeple
ss night he had
 not the slighte
"st doubt, and th"
e guiltlessness 
"of
Dólokhov, w"
ho had no reason
 to preserve the
 honor of a man 
who was nothing
 to him.... “I
 should perhaps 
have done the sa
me thing in his 
"
place,” thoug"
ht Pierre. “It
’s even certai
n that I should 
have done the s
"ame, then why th"
"is duel, this mu"
rder? Either I s
"hall kill him, o"
r he will hit m
"e in the head, o"
"r elbow, or knee"
. Can’t I go a
"way from
here, "
"run away, bury m"
yself somewhere?
” passed throu
gh his mind. But
 just at moment
s when such thou
ghts occurred to
" him, he would a"
sk in a particu
larly calm and a
bsent-minded way
", which inspired"
 the respect of 
"
the onlookers, "
“Will it be lo
ng? Are things r
eady?”  When
" all was ready, "
the sabers stuck
 in the snow to 
mark the barrier
"s,
and the pist"
"ols loaded, Nesv"
ítski went up t
o Pierre.  “
I should not be 
"doing my duty, C"
"ount,” he said"
" in timid tones,"
 “and should 
not justify your
 confidence and 
the honor you ha
ve done me in c
hoosing me for y
"our second, if a"
"t this grave, th"
"is very
grave, "
moment I did not
 tell you the wh
ole truth. I thi
nk there is no 
sufficient groun
d for this affai
"r, or for blood "
to be shed over 
it.... You were
" not right, not "
quite in the rig
"ht, you were imp"
etuous...”  
"“Oh yes, it is"
 horribly stupid
",” said Pierre"
.  “Then all
ow me to express
" your regrets, a"
nd I am sure you
r opponent will
" accept them,”"
 said Nesvítski
 (who like the o
thers concerned 
"in
the affair, "
and like everyon
e in similar cas
"es, did not yet "
believe that th
e affair had com
e to an actual d
uel). “You kno
"w, Count, it is "
much more honor
able to admit on
e’s mistake th
an to let matter
s become irrepa
rable. There was
 no insult on ei
ther side. Allow
 me to convey..
..”  “No! 
What is there to
 talk about?” 
said Pierre. “
It’s all the 
same.... Is ever
ything ready?”
 he added. “On
ly tell me where
 to go and wher
"e to shoot,” h"
e said with an u
nnaturally gentl
e smile.  He t
ook the pistol i
n his hand and b
egan asking abou
t the working of
" the
trigger, a"
s he had not bef
ore held a pisto
l in his hand—
a fact that he 
did not wish to 
confess.  “O
"h yes, like that"
", I know, I only"
" forgot,” said"
 he.  “No ap
"ologies, none wh"
"atever,” said "
Dólokhov to Den
ísov (who on h
is side had been
 attempting a re
"conciliation), a"
nd he also went 
up to the appoi
nted place.  T
he spot chosen f
or the duel was 
some eighty pace
"s from the road,"
 where the slei
ghs had been lef
"t, in a small cl"
earing in the pi
ne forest cover
ed with melting 
"snow, the frost "
having begun to 
break up during 
the last few da
ys. The antagoni
sts stood forty 
paces apart at t
he farther edge
 of the clearing
". The seconds, m"
easuring the pac
"es, left tracks "
in the deep wet
 snow between th
e place where th
ey had been stan
ding and Nesví
tski’s and Dó
lokhov’s saber
"s, which were st"
uck into the gr
ound ten paces a
part to mark the
 barrier. It was
 thawing and mis
ty; at forty pa
ces’ distance 
nothing could be
 seen. For three
 minutes all had
"
been ready, bu"
t they still del
ayed and all wer
e silent.    
   CHAPTER V 
"
“Well, begin"
!” said Dólok
hov.  “All r
"ight,” said Pi"
"erre, still smil"
ing in the same 
way. A feeling 
of dread was in 
the air. It was 
evident that the
 affair so light
ly begun could 
no longer be ave
rted but was tak
ing its course i
ndependently of 
 men’s will. 
 Denísov first
 went to the bar
rier and announc
ed: “As the a
dve’sawies hav
e wefused a weco
"nciliation, plea"
se pwoceed. Take
" your
pistols, "
and at the word 
thwee begin to a
dvance.  “O-
ne! T-wo! Thwee!
” he shouted a
ngrily and stepp
ed aside.  The
 combatants adva
nced along the t
"rodden tracks, n"
earer and nearer
 to one another
", beginning to s"
ee one another t
hrough the mist.
 They had the r
ight to fire whe
n they liked as 
they approached 
the barrier. Dó
lokhov walked s
lowly without ra
ising his pistol
", looking intent"
ly with his bri
"ght, sparkling b"
lue eyes into hi
s antagonist’s
 face. His mouth
 wore its usual
 semblance of a 
smile.  “So 
I can fire when 
I like!” said 
"Pierre, and at t"
he word “thre
"e,” he went qu"
"ickly forward, m"
issing the trodd
en path and ste
pping into the d
eep snow. He hel
d the pistol in 
his right hand a
t arm’s lengt
"h, apparently af"
raid of shooting
 himself with it
. His left hand
 he held careful
"ly back, because"
 he wished to su
pport his right 
 hand with it an
d knew he must n
ot do so. Having
 advanced six pa
ces and strayed
 off the track i
"nto the snow, Pi"
erre looked down
" at his feet,
t"
hen quickly glan
ced at Dólokhov
" and, bending hi"
s finger as he h
"ad been
shown, "
fired. Not at al
l expecting so l
"oud a report, Pi"
erre shuddered 
at the sound and
" then, smiling a"
t his own sensat
"ions, stood stil"
"l. The
smoke, r"
endered denser b
"y the mist, prev"
ented him from s
eeing anything 
"for an instant, "
but there was no
 second report a
s he had expecte
d. He only hear
d Dólokhov’s 
"hurried steps, a"
nd his figure ca
me in view thro
ugh the smoke. H
e was pressing o
ne hand to his l
"eft side, while"
 the other clutc
hed his drooping
 pistol. His fac
e was pale. Rost
óv ran toward 
him and said som
ething.  “No
-o-o!” muttere
d Dólokhov thro
"ugh his teeth, �"
"��no, it’s not"
 over.” And a
fter stumbling a
 few staggering 
steps right up t
"o the
saber, he"
 sank on the sno
w beside it. His
 left hand was b
loody; he wiped 
 it on his coat 
and supported hi
mself with it. H
is frowning face
 was pallid and
 quivered.  �
�Plea...” bega
"n Dólokhov, but"
 could not at fi
rst pronounce th
e word.  “P
"lease,” he utt"
ered with an eff
"ort.

Pierre, "
hardly restraini
"ng his sobs, beg"
an running towar
d Dólokhov and 
 was about to cr
oss the space be
tween the barrie
"rs, when Dólokh"
ov cried:  “
To your barrier!
"” and Pierre, "
grasping what wa
"s meant, stopped"
 by his saber. 
Only ten paces d
ivided them. Dó
lokhov lowered h
is head to the 
"snow, greedily b"
"it at it, again "
"raised his head,"
 adjusted himsel
"f,
drew in his "
"legs and sat up,"
 seeking a firm 
center of gravit
y. He sucked an
d swallowed the 
"cold snow, his l"
ips quivered but
" his eyes, still"
"
smiling, glitt"
ered with effort
 and exasperatio
n as he mustered
 his remaining 
strength. He rai
sed his pistol a
nd aimed.  “
Sideways! Cover 
yourself with yo
ur pistol!” ej
aculated Nesvít
ski.  “Cover
 yourself!” ev
en Denísov crie
d to his adversa
"ry.

Pierre, w"
ith a gentle smi
le of pity and r
"emorse, his arms"
 and legs helpl
essly spread out
", stood with his"
 broad chest dir
ectly facing D�
�lokhov and look
ed sorrowfully a
"t him. Denísov,"
" Rostóv, and
N"
esvítski closed
 their eyes. At 
the same instant
 they heard a re
port and Dólok
hov’s angry cr
y.  “Missed!
” shouted Dól
"okhov, and he la"
"y helplessly, fa"
ce downwards on
 the snow.  Pi
erre clutched hi
"s temples, and t"
urning round wen
t into the fores
"t,
trampling th"
rough the deep s
"now, and mutteri"
ng incoherent wo
rds:  “Folly
... folly! Death
... lies...” h
"e repeated, puck"
ering his face. 
  Nesvítski st
opped him and to
ok him home.  
Rostóv and Den�
�sov drove away 
with the wounded
 Dólokhov.  T
he latter lay si
lent in the slei
gh with closed e
yes and did not 
answer a word t
o the questions 
addressed to him
. But on enterin
g Moscow he sud
denly came to an
"d, lifting his h"
ead with an effo
"rt, took Rostóv"
", who
was sitti"
"ng beside him, b"
y the hand. Rost
óv was struck b
y the totally a
ltered and unexp
ectedly rapturou
s and tender exp
ression on Dól
okhov’s face. 
  “Well? How 
do you feel?” 
he asked.  “
Bad! But it’s 
"not that, my fri"
end—” said D
ólokhov with a 
 gasping voice. 
“Where are we?
" In Moscow, I kn"
ow. I don’t ma
"tter,
but I hav"
"e killed her, ki"
lled... She won�
��t get over it!
 She won’t su
rvive....”  
“Who?” asked
 Rostóv.  “
My mother! My mo
"ther, my angel, "
my adored angel 
"mother,” and
"
Dólokhov presse
d Rostóv’s ha
nd and burst int
o tears.  When
 he had become a
" little quieter,"
 he explained to
 Rostóv that he
 was living wit
"h his mother, wh"
"o, if she saw hi"
"m dying, would n"
ot survive it. 
He implored Rost
óv to go on and
 prepare her.  
 Rostóv went on
 ahead to do wha
"t was asked, and"
 to his great su
rprise learned 
that Dólokhov t
"he brawler, Dól"
"okhov the bully,"
 lived in Moscow
 with an old mo
ther and a hunch
"back sister, and"
 was the most af
fectionate of s
ons and brothers
.      CHA
PTER VI  Pierr
e had of late ra
rely seen his wi
fe alone. Both i
n Petersburg and
 in Moscow thei
r house was alwa
ys full of visit
ors. The night a
fter the duel h
e did not go to 
"his bedroom but,"
 as he often did
", remained in hi"
s father’s ro
"om, that huge ro"
om in which Coun
t Bezúkhov had 
died.  He lay 
down on the sofa
 meaning to fall
 asleep and forg
et all that had
 happened to him
", but could not "
do so. Such a st
"orm of feelings,"
"
thoughts, and "
memories suddenl
y arose within h
im that he could
 not fall aslee
"p, nor even rema"
"in in one place,"
 but had to jump
 up and pace the
 room with rapi
d steps. Now he 
seemed to see he
r in the early d
ays of their ma
"rriage, with bar"
e shoulders and 
"a languid, passi"
onate look on h
"er face, and the"
n immediately he
 saw beside her 
Dólokhov’s ha
"ndsome,
insolen"
"t, hard, and moc"
king face as he 
had seen it at t
"he banquet, and"
 then that same 
"face pale, quive"
"ring, and suffer"
"ing, as it had b"
een when he ree
led and sank on 
the snow.  “
What has happene
d?” he asked h
imself. “I hav
e killed her lov
"er,
yes, killed"
 my wife’s lov
"er. Yes, that wa"
s it! And why? H
ow did I come t
o do it?”—�
�Because you mar
"ried her,” ans"
wered an inner v
oice.  “But 
in what was I to
 blame?” he as
ked. “In marry
ing her without 
 loving her; in 
deceiving yourse
lf and her.” A
nd he vividly re
called that mom
ent after supper
 at Prince Vasí
"li’s, when he "
spoke those wor
ds he had found 
so difficult to 
utter: “I love
 you.” “It a
ll comes from t
hat! Even then I
" felt it,” he "
thought. “I fe
lt then that it
" was not so, tha"
t I had no right
 to do it. And s
o it turns out.�
��  He remembe
red his honeymoo
n and blushed at
 the recollectio
n. Particularly
" vivid, humiliat"
"ing, and shamefu"
l was the recoll
ection of how o
ne day soon afte
r his marriage h
e came out of th
e bedroom into h
is study a litt
le before noon i
n his silk dress
ing gown and fou
nd his head ste
"ward there, who,"
 bowing respectf
"ully, looked int"
o his face and a
t his dressing 
gown and smiled 
"slightly, as if "
expressing respe
ctful understan
ding of his empl
oyer’s happine
ss.  “But ho
w often I have f
elt proud of her
", proud of her m"
ajestic beauty 
"and social tact,"
” thought he; 
“been proud of
" my house, in wh"
ich she receive
d all Petersburg
", proud of her u"
napproachability
 and beauty. So 
 this is what I 
was proud of! I 
then thought tha
t I did not unde
rstand her. How
 often when cons
idering her char
acter I have tol
d myself that I
 was to blame fo
r not understand
"ing her, for not"
 understanding t
hat constant co
mposure and comp
lacency and lack
 of all interest
"s or desires,
a"
nd the whole sec
ret lies in the 
terrible truth t
hat she is a dep
raved woman. No
w I have spoken 
that terrible wo
rd to myself all
 has become cle
ar.  “Anatol
e used to come t
o borrow money f
rom her and used
 to kiss her na
ked shoulders. S
he did not give 
"him the money, b"
ut let herself b
e kissed. Her f
ather in jest tr
ied to rouse her
" jealousy, and s"
he replied with
 a calm smile th
at she was not s
o stupid as to b
e jealous: ‘Le
t him do what h
"e pleases,’ sh"
e used to say of
 me. One day I a
sked her if she
 felt any sympto
ms of pregnancy.
 She laughed con
temptuously and 
said she was no
t a fool to want
 to have childre
"n, and that she "
was not going t
o have any child
ren by me.”  
 Then he recalle
d the coarseness
 and bluntness o
f her thoughts a
nd the vulgarit
y of the express
ions that were n
"atural to her, t"
hough she had b
een brought up i
n the most arist
ocratic circles.
  “I’m not
 such a fool....
 Just you try it
 on.... Allez-vo
"us

 * she used to s
ay. Often seeing
 the success she
 had with young
 and old men and
 women Pierre co
uld not understa
nd why he did no
t love her.  
    * “You cle
ar out of this.�
"��


“Yes, "
I never loved he
"r,” said he to"
 himself; “I k
new she was a d
"epraved woman,�"
"� he repeated, �"
��but dared not 
admit it to myse
lf. And now the
re’s Dólokhov
 sitting in the 
snow with a forc
ed smile and pe
"rhaps dying, whi"
le meeting my re
morse with some 
forced bravado!�
��  Pierre was
 one of those pe
"ople who, in spi"
te of an appeara
nce of what is 
called weak char
"acter, do not se"
ek a confidant i
n their troubles
. He digested h
is sufferings al
one.  “It is
" all, all her fa"
"ult,” he said "
to himself; “b
ut what of that?
 Why did I bind
 myself to her? 
Why did I say �
�Je vous aime’
" * to her,
whic"
"h was a lie, and"
 worse than a li

. what? A slur

"
nonsense,” he"
 thought. “The

      * I love

�  But at the

s cette galère?
” * occurred t
"o him, and he be"
gan to laugh at 
 himself.     
   * “But what
 the devil was h
e doing in that 
galley?”   
In the night he 
called his valet
 and told him to
 pack up to go t
o Petersburg. H
e could not imag
ine how he could
 speak to her no
w. He resolved 
to go away next 
day and leave a 
letter informing
 her of his int
ention to part f
rom her forever.
  Next morning
 when the valet 
came into the ro
om with his coff
"ee, Pierre
was "
lying asleep on 
the ottoman with
 an open book in
 his hand.  He
 woke up and loo
ked round for a 
while with a sta
rtled expression
",
unable to rea"
lize where he wa
s.  “The cou
ntess told me to
 inquire whether
 your excellency
" was at
home,�"
� said the valet
.  But before 
Pierre could dec
ide what answer 
"he would send, t"
he countess her
self in a white 
satin dressing g
own embroidered 
with silver and 
with simply dre
ssed hair (two i
mmense plaits tw
ice round her lo
vely head like 
a coronet) enter
"ed the room, cal"
"m and majestic, "
except that ther
e was a wrathfu
l wrinkle on her
 rather prominen
t marble brow. W
ith her impertu
rbable calm she 
did not begin to
 speak in front 
of the valet. S
he knew of the d
uel and had come
 to speak about 
it. She waited t
ill the valet h
ad set down the 
coffee things an
d left the room.
 Pierre looked 
at her timidly o
ver his spectacl
"es, and like a h"
are surrounded b
y hounds who la
ys back her ears
 and continues t
o crouch motionl
ess before her 
"enemies, he trie"
d to continue re
ading. But feeli
ng this to be se
nseless and imp
"ossible, he agai"
n glanced timidl
y at her. She di
d not sit down 
but looked at hi
m with a contemp
"tuous smile, wai"
ting for the val
et to go.  �
"�Well, what’s "
this now? What h
ave you been up 
"to now, I should"
 like to know?�
�� she asked ste
rnly.  “I? W
hat have I...?�
� stammered Pier
re.  “So it 
seems you’re a
" hero, eh? Come "
"now, what was th"
is duel about? 
What is it meant
 to prove? What?
 I ask you.” 
 Pierre turned 
over heavily on 
the ottoman and 
opened his mouth
", but
could not"
 reply.  “If
 you won’t ans
"wer, I’ll tell"
 you...” Hél�
�ne went on. “
You believe eve
rything you’re
 told. You were 
told...” Hél�
"�ne laughed,
�"
�that Dólokhov 
"was my lover,”"
 she said in Fre
nch with her coa
rse plainness o
"f speech, utteri"
ng the word aman
t as casually as
 any other word
", “and you bel"
"ieved it! Well, "
what have you pr
oved? What does 
this duel prove
? That you’re 
"a fool, que vous"
" êtes un sot, b"
ut everybody kn
ew that. What wi
ll be the result
? That I shall b
e the laughingst
ock of all Mosc
"ow, that everyon"
e will say that 
"you, drunk and n"
ot knowing what 
"
you were about,"
 challenged a ma
n you are jealou
s of without cau
se.” Hélène
 raised her voic
e and became mor
e and more excit
"ed, “A man
wh"
o’s a better m
an than you in e
very way...” 
 “Hm... Hm...
!” growled Pie
"rre, frowning wi"
thout looking at
" her, and
not m"
oving a muscle. 
  “And how co
uld you believe 
he was my lover?
 Why? Because I 
like his compan
y? If you were c
leverer and more
" agreeable, I sh"
ould prefer you
rs.”  “Don
’t speak to me
"... I beg you,�"
� muttered Pierr
e hoarsely.  �
��Why shouldn’
t I speak? I can
 speak as I like
", and I tell you"
 plainly that t
here are not man
y wives with hus
bands such as yo
u who would not
 have taken love
"rs (des amants),"
 but I have not 
"done so,”
sai"
d she.  Pierre
 wished to say s
"omething, looked"
 at her with eye
s whose strange 
 expression she 
did not understa
"nd, and lay down"
 again. He was s
uffering physic
ally at that mom
"ent, there was a"
 weight on his c
hest and he coul
d not breathe. 
He knew that he 
must do somethin
g to put an end 
to this sufferi
"ng, but what he "
wanted to do was
 too terrible. 
 “We had bett
"er separate,” "
he muttered in a
 broken voice. 
 “Separate? V
"ery well, but on"
ly if you give m
"e a fortune,” "
said Hélène. 
“Separate! Tha
t’s a thing to
 frighten me wit
h!”  Pierre 
leaped up from t
he sofa and rush
ed staggering to
ward her.  “
I’ll kill you!
"” he shouted, "
and seizing the 
marble top of a 
table with a st
rength he had ne
"ver before felt,"
 he made a step 
toward her bran
dishing the slab
.  Hélène’
s face became te
"rrible, she shri"
eked and sprang 
aside. His fath
er’s nature sh
owed itself in P
ierre. He felt t
he fascination a
nd delight of f
renzy. He flung 
"down the slab, b"
"roke it, and swo"
oping down on h
er with outstret
ched hands shout
"ed, “Get out!�"
�� in such a te
rrible voice tha
t the whole hous
e heard it with 
horror. God know
s what he would
 have done at th
at moment had H�
�lène not fled 
from the room. 
  A week later
 Pierre gave his
 wife full power
 to control all 
his estates in 
"Great Russia, wh"
ich formed the l
arger part of hi
"s property, and "
left for Peters
burg alone.   
    CHAPTER V
II  Two months
 had elapsed sin
ce the news of t
he battle of Aus
terlitz and the
 loss of Prince 
Andrew had reach
"ed Bald Hills, a"
nd in spite of t
he letters sent
 through the emb
assy and all the
" searches made, "
his body had no
t been found nor
 was he on the l
ist of prisoners
. What was worst
 of all for his
 relations was t
he fact that the
re was still a p
ossibility of h
is having been p
icked up on the 
battlefield by t
he people of the
 place and that
 he might now be
" lying, recoveri"
"ng or dying, alo"
ne among strang
ers and unable t
o send news of h
imself. The gaze
ttes from which 
 the old prince 
first heard of t
he defeat at Aus
"terlitz stated, "
as usual very b
riefly and vague
"ly, that after b"
rilliant engagem
ents the Russian
s had had to re
treat and had ma
de their withdra
wal in perfect o
rder. The old p
rince understood
 from this offic
ial report that 
our army had bee
n defeated. A w
eek after the ga
zette report of 
the battle of Au
sterlitz came a
 letter from Kut
úzov informing 
the prince of th
e fate that had 
 befallen his so
n.  “Your so
"n,” wrote Kut�"
"�zov, “fell be"
"fore my eyes, a "
standard in his
 hand and at the
 head of a regim
ent—he fell as
" a hero, worthy "
of his father a
nd his fatherlan
d. To the great 
regret of myself
 and of the who
le army it is st
ill uncertain wh
ether he is aliv
e or not. I comf
ort myself and 
you with the hop
e that your son 
"is alive, for ot"
herwise he woul
d have been ment
ioned among the 
officers found o
n the field of 
"battle, a list o"
f whom has been 
sent me under fl
ag of truce.” 
  After receivi
ng this news lat
e in the evening
", when he was al"
one in his stud
"y, the old princ"
e went for his w
alk as usual nex
"t morning, but h"
e was silent wi
"th his steward, "
"the gardener, an"
"d the architect,"
 and though he 
looked very grim
 he said nothing
 to anyone.  W
hen Princess Mar
y went to him at
 the usual hour 
he was working a
t his lathe and
", as usual, did "
not look round a
"t her.

“Ah,"
 Princess Mary!�
�� he said sudde
nly in an unnatu
"ral voice,
thro"
wing down his ch
isel. (The wheel
 continued to re
volve by its own
"
impetus, and P"
rincess Mary lon
g remembered the
 dying creak of 
"that
wheel, whi"
ch merged in her
 memory with wha
t followed.)  
She approached h
"im, saw his face"
", and something "
gave way within 
her. Her eyes g
rew dim. By the 
expression of he
r father’s fac
"e, not sad, not"
"
crushed, but an"
gry and working 
"unnaturally, she"
 saw that hangin
g over her and 
about to crush h
er was some terr
"ible misfortune,"
 the worst in l
"ife, one she had"
 not yet experie
"nced, irreparabl"
e and incompreh
ensible—the de
ath of one she l
oved.  “Fath
er! Andrew!”�
�said the ungrac
"eful, awkward pr"
incess with such
 an indescribab
le charm of sorr
ow and self-forg
etfulness that h
er father could
 not bear her lo
ok but turned aw
ay with a sob. 
 “Bad news! H
e’s not among 
the prisoners no
r among the kill
ed! Kutúzov wr
ites...” and h
e screamed as pi
ercingly as if h
e wished to dri
ve the princess 
away by that scr
eam... “Killed
!”  The prin
cess did not fal
l down or faint.
 She was already
" pale, but on
h"
earing these wor
ds her face chan
ged and somethin
g brightened in 
"her
beautiful, "
radiant eyes. It
 was as if joy�
�a supreme joy a
part from the j
oys and sorrows 
of this world—
overflowed the g
reat grief withi
n her. She forg
ot all fear of h
"er father, went "
"up to him, took "
"his hand, and
d"
rawing him down 
put her arm roun
"d his thin, scra"
ggy neck.  “
"Father,” she s"
"aid, “do not t"
urn away from me
", let us weep
t"
ogether.”  �
��Scoundrels! Bl
ackguards!” sh
rieked the old m
"an, turning his "
face away from 
her. “Destroyi
"ng the army, des"
troying the men!
" And why? Go,
g"
o and tell Lise.
”  The princ
ess sank helples
sly into an armc
hair beside her 
father and wept
. She saw her br
other now as he 
had been at the 
moment when he t
ook leave of he
"r and of Lise, h"
is look tender y
et proud. She sa
w him tender an
d amused as he w
as when he put o
n the little ico
n. “Did he bel
ieve? Had he re
pented of his un
belief? Was he n
ow there? There 
in the realms o
f eternal peace 
and blessedness?
” she thought.
"

“Father, t"
ell me how it ha
"ppened,” she a"
sked through her
 tears.  “Go
! Go! Killed in 
"battle, where th"
e best of Russia
n men and Russi
a’s glory were
 led to destruct
"ion. Go, Princes"
s Mary. Go and t
ell Lise. I wil
l follow.”  
When Princess Ma
ry returned from
" her father, the"
 little princess
 sat working an
d looked up with
 that curious ex
pression of inne
"r, happy calm
p"
eculiar to pregn
ant women. It wa
s evident that h
er eyes did not 
see Princess Ma
ry but were look
ing within... in
to herself... at
 something joyf
ul and mysteriou
s taking place w
ithin her.  �
"�Mary,” she sa"
"id, moving away "
from the embroid
ery frame and ly
"ing
back, “gi"
ve me your hand.
” She took her
 sister-in-law�
�s hand and hel
d it below her w
aist.  Her eye
s were smiling e
"xpectantly, her "
downy lip rose a
nd remained lif
ted in childlike
 happiness.  P
rincess Mary kne
lt down before h
er and hid her f
ace in the folds
 of her sister-
in-law’s dress
".

“There, t"
here! Do you fee
l it? I feel so 
strange. And do 
"you know,
Mary,"
 I am going to l
ove him very muc
"h,” said Lise,"
 looking with b
right and happy 
eyes at her sist
er-in-law.  Pr
incess Mary coul
d not lift her h
"ead, she was wee"
ping.  “What
" is the matter, "
Mary?”  “N
othing... only I
 feel sad... sad
" about Andrew,�"
"� she said, wipi"
ng away her tea
rs on her sister
-in-law’s knee
.  Several tim
es in the course
 of the morning 
Princess Mary be
gan trying to p
repare her siste
"r-in-law, and ev"
ery time began t
o cry. Unobserva
nt as was the l
"ittle princess, "
"these tears, the"
 cause of which 
she did not und
"erstand, agitate"
d her. She said 
nothing but look
ed about uneasil
y as if in sear
ch of something.
 Before dinner t
"he old prince, o"
f whom she was 
"always afraid, c"
ame into her roo
m with a peculia
rly restless and
 malign express
ion and went out
 again without s
aying a word. Sh
e looked at Pri
"ncess Mary, then"
 sat thinking fo
r a while with t
hat expression o
f attention to 
something within
 her that is onl
y seen in pregna
"nt women,
and s"
uddenly began to
 cry.  “Has 
anything come fr
om Andrew?” sh
e asked.  “N
"o, you know it�"
�s too soon for 
news. But my fat
her is anxious a
nd I feel afrai
d.”  “So t
here’s nothing
?”  “Nothi
"ng,” answered "
"Princess Mary, l"
ooking firmly wi
th her radiant 
eyes at her sist
er-in-law.  Sh
e had determined
 not to tell her
 and persuaded h
er father to hid
e the terrible 
news from her ti
ll after her con
"finement, which "
was expected wi
thin a few days.
 Princess Mary a
nd the old princ
e each bore and 
hid their grief
 in their own wa
y. The old princ
e would not cher
ish any hope: h
e made up his mi
nd that Prince A
ndrew had been k
"illed, and thoug"
h he sent an of
ficial to Austri
a to seek for tr
"aces of his son,"
 he ordered a m
onument from Mos
cow which he int
ended to erect i
n his own garden
" to his
memory,"
 and he told eve
rybody that his 
son had been kil
led. He tried no
t to change his
 former way of l
"ife, but his str"
ength failed him
. He walked les
"s, ate less, sle"
"pt less, and bec"
ame weaker every
 day. Princess M
ary hoped. She 
prayed for her b
rother as living
 and was always 
awaiting news o
f his return.  
     CHAPTER
 VIII  “Dear
"est,” said the"
 little princess
 after breakfast
 on the morning 
 of the nineteen
"th March, and he"
r downy little l
ip rose from old
" habit,

sorrow was manif

rrible news had 
"come, so

e smile of the l

to remind one st

 general sorrow.

“Dearest, "
I’m afraid thi
s morning’s fr

 Fóka the cook
 calls it—has 
disagreed with m

t is the matter 
"with you, my dar"
ling? You look p
"ale. Oh, you
ar"
e very pale!” 
said Princess Ma
"ry in alarm, run"
ning with her so
"ft,
ponderous s"
teps up to her s
ister-in-law.  
 “Your excelle
"ncy, should not "
Mary Bogdánovna
 be sent for?”
 said one of th
e maids who was 
present. (Mary B
ogdánovna was a
 midwife from th
e neighboring t
"own, who had bee"
n at Bald Hills 
for the last for
tnight.)  “O
"h yes,” assent"
ed Princess Mary
", “perhaps tha"
t’s it. I’ll

Courage, m"

kissed Lise and 
was about to lea

"“Oh, no, no!�"
� And besides th
e pallor and the
 physical suffer

"ace, an expressi"
on of childish f
ear of inevitab

"tself.

“No,"
 it’s only ind
igestion?... Say
 it’s only ind
"igestion, say so"
",
Mary! Say...�"
�� And the littl
e princess began
 to cry capricio
usly like a suf
fering child and
 to wring her li
ttle hands even 
with some affec
tation. Princess
 Mary ran out of
 the room to fet
ch Mary Bogdán
ovna.  “Mon 
Dieu! Mon Dieu! 
Oh!” she heard
 as she left the
 room.  The mi
dwife was alread
y on her way to 
"meet her, rubbin"
"g her small, plu"
mp white hands 
with an air of c
alm importance. 
  “Mary Bogd�
"�novna, I think "
it’s beginning
!” said Prince
ss Mary looking
 at the midwife 
with wide-open e
yes of alarm.  
"
“Well, the Lo"
"rd be thanked, P"
"rincess,” said"
 Mary Bogdánovn
"a, not
hastenin"
g her steps. “
You young ladies
 should not know
 anything about 
 it.”  “Bu
t how is it the 
doctor from Mosc
ow is not here y
et?” said the 
 princess. (In a
ccordance with L
ise’s and Prin
ce Andrew’s wi
shes they had s
ent in good time
 to Moscow for a
 doctor and were
 expecting him a
t any moment.) 
"

“No matter,"
" Princess, don�"
"�t be alarmed,�"
� said Mary Bogd
ánovna. “We�
��ll manage very
 well without a 
doctor.”  Fi
ve minutes later
 Princess Mary f
rom her room hea
rd something hea
vy being carrie
d by. She looked
 out. The men se
rvants were carr
ying the large 
leather sofa fro
m Prince Andrew�
��s study into t
he bedroom. On 
their faces was 
a quiet and sole
mn look.  Prin
cess Mary sat al
one in her room 
listening to the
 sounds in the 
"house, now and t"
hen opening her 
door when someon
e passed and wat
ching what was 
going on in the 
passage. Some wo
men passing with
 quiet steps in 
 and out of the 
bedroom glanced 
at the princess 
and turned away.
 She did not ve
nture to ask any
" questions, and "
shut the door ag
"ain, now sitting"
 down in her ea
"sy chair, now ta"
king her prayer 
"book, now kneeli"
ng before the i
con stand. To he
r surprise and d
istress she foun
d that her praye
rs did not calm
 her excitement.
 Suddenly her do
or opened softly
 and her old nu
"rse, Praskóvya "
"Sávishna, who h"
ardly ever came 
to that room as 
the old prince 
had forbidden it
", appeared on th"
e threshold with
 a shawl round 
her head.  “
I’ve come to s
it with you a bi
"t, Másha,” sa"
"id the nurse, �"
�and here I’v
e brought the pr
ince’s wedding
 candles to ligh
t before his sa

� she said with 
a sigh.  “Oh

o glad!”  �
�God is merciful
", birdie.”

"
The nurse lit th
e gilt candles b
efore the icons 
and sat down by 
the door with h
er knitting. Pri
ncess Mary took 
a book and began
 reading. Only 
when footsteps o
r voices were he
ard did they loo
k at one another
", the
princess "
anxious and inqu
"iring, the nurse"
 encouraging. Ev
eryone in the h
ouse was dominat
ed by the same f
eeling that Prin
cess Mary experi
enced as she sa
t in her room. B
ut owing to the 
superstition tha
t the fewer the
 people who know
 of it the less 
a woman in trava
"il suffers, ever"
yone tried to p
retend not to kn
ow; no one spoke
" of it, but apar"
t from the ordi
nary staid and r
espectful good m
anners habitual 
in the prince’
"s
household, a "
"common anxiety, "
a softening of t
"he heart, and a"
 consciousness t
hat something gr
eat and mysterio
us was being acc
omplished at th
at moment made i
tself felt.  T
here was no laug
hter in the maid
s’ large hall.
 In the men serv
ants’ hall al
"l sat waiting, s"
ilently and aler
t. In the outlyi
ng serfs’ qua
rters torches an
d candles were b
urning and no on
e slept. The old
"
prince, steppi"
"ng on his heels,"
 paced up and do
wn his study and
 sent Tíkhon t
o ask Mary Bogd�
�novna what news
.—“Say only 
that ‘the pri
nce told me to a
"sk,’ and come "
and tell me her 
answer.”  �
�Inform the prin
ce that labor ha
"s begun,” said"
 Mary Bogdánovn
"a,
giving the m"
essenger a signi
ficant look.  
Tíkhon went and
 told the prince
.  “Very goo
d!” said the p
rince closing th
e door behind hi
"m, and
Tíkhon "
did not hear the
 slightest sound
 from the study 
after that.  A
fter a while he 
re-entered it as
 if to snuff the
" candles, and, s"
eeing the princ
e was lying on t
"he sofa, looked "
"at him, noticed "
his perturbed f
"ace, shook his h"
"ead, and going u"
p to him silentl
y kissed him on 
the shoulder an
d left the room 
without snuffing
 the candles or 
saying why he h
ad entered. The 
most solemn myst
ery in the world
 continued its c
ourse. Evening 
"passed, night ca"
"me, and the feel"
ing of suspense 
and softening of
 heart in the p
resence of the u
nfathomable did 
not lessen but i
ncreased. No on
e slept.  It w
as one of those 
March nights whe
n winter seems t
o wish to resume
 its sway and s
catters its last
 snows and storm
s with desperate
 fury. A relay 
of horses had be
en sent up the h
ighroad to meet 
the German docto
r from Moscow w
ho was expected 
"every moment, an"
d men on horseba
ck with lanterns
 were sent to t
he crossroads to
 guide him over 
the country road
 with its hollo
ws and snow-cove
red pools of wat
er.  Princess 
Mary had long si
nce put aside he
r book: she sat 
"silent, her
lum"
inous eyes fixed
 on her nurse’
s wrinkled face 
(every line of w
hich she knew s
"o well), on the "
lock of gray hai
r that escaped f
rom under the k
"erchief, and the"
 loose skin that
 hung under her 
chin.  Nurse S
"ávishna, knitti"
"ng in hand, was "
telling in low t
"ones, scarcely
"
hearing or under
standing her own
" words, what she"
 had told hundre
ds of times bef
ore: how the lat
e princess had g
iven birth to Pr
incess Mary in 
Kishenëv with o
nly a Moldavian 
peasant woman to
 help instead of
 a midwife.  
“God is mercif

"never needed,”"
 she said.  Su
ddenly a gust of
 wind beat viole

 casement of the
"
window, from w"
hich the double 
frame had been r
emoved (by order
" of the
prince,"
 one window fram
e was removed in
 each room as so
on as the larks 
"
returned), and,"
 forcing open a 
loosely closed l
"atch, set the da"
mask curtain fl

out the candle w
"ith its chill, s"
nowy draft. Pri
ncess Mary shudd
"ered; her nurse,"
 putting down th
e stocking she w
"as
knitting, we"
nt to the window
 and leaning out
 tried to catch 
the open caseme
nt. The cold win
d flapped the en
ds of her kerchi
ef and her loose
 locks of gray 
hair.  “Prin
"cess, my dear, t"
here’s someone
 driving up the 
avenue!” she 
"said, holding th"
e casement and n
ot closing it. �
��With lanterns.
 Most likely th
e doctor.”  
"“Oh, my God! t"
hank God!” sai
d Princess Mary.
 “I must go an
"d meet
him, he "
does not know Ru
ssian.”  Pri
ncess Mary threw
 a shawl over he
r head and ran t
o meet the newco
mer. As she was
 crossing the an
teroom she saw t
hrough the windo
w a carriage wi
"th lanterns, sta"
nding at the ent
rance. She went 
out on the stair
s. On a baniste
r post stood a t
allow candle whi
ch guttered in t
he draft. On th
"e landing below,"
" Philip, the foo"
"tman, stood look"
ing scared and h
olding another 
candle. Still lo
"wer, beyond the "
turn of the stai
"rcase, one
coul"
d hear the foots
tep of someone i
n thick felt boo
"ts, and a voice "
that seemed fam
iliar to Princes
s Mary was sayin
g something.  
“Thank God!”
 said the voice.
 “And Father?�
��  “Gone to
" bed,” replied"
 the voice of De
myán the house 
"steward, who
wa"
s downstairs.  
 Then the voice 
said something m
"ore, Demyán rep"
"lied, and the st"
eps in the felt
 boots approache
d the unseen ben
d of the stairca
se more rapidly.
  “It’s An
drew!” thought
 Princess Mary. 
“No it can’t
" be, that
would"
 be too extraord
"inary,” and at"
 the very moment
 she thought thi
"s,
the face and"
 figure of Princ
"e Andrew, in a f"
ur cloak the dee
p collar of whi
ch covered with 
"snow, appeared o"
n the landing wh
ere the footman 
 stood with the 
"candle. Yes, it "
"was he, pale, th"
"in, with a chang"
ed and strangel
y softened but a
gitated expressi
on on his face. 
He came up the 
stairs and embra
ced his sister. 
  “You did no
t get my letter?
"” he asked, an"
d not waiting fo
r a reply—whi
ch he would not 
"have received, f"
or the princess 
was unable to s
peak—he turned
" back, rapidly m"
ounted the stair
s again with the
 doctor who had
 entered the hal
l after him (the
y had met at the
 last post stat
"ion), and again "
embraced his sis
ter.  “What 
"a strange fate, "
Másha darling!�
�� And having ta
ken off his clo
ak and felt boot
"s, he went to th"
e little princes
s’ apartment. 
      CHAPT
ER IX  The lit
tle princess lay
 supported by pi
"llows, with a wh"
ite cap on her 
head (the pains 
had just left he
r). Strands of h
er black hair la
y round her inf
lamed and perspi
"ring cheeks, her"
 charming rosy m
outh with its d
owny lip was ope
n and she was sm
iling joyfully. 
Prince Andrew en
tered and pause
d facing her at 
the foot of the 
sofa on which sh
e was lying. He
r glittering eye
"s, filled with c"
hildlike fear an
"d excitement, re"
sted on him wit
hout changing th
eir expression. 
“I love you al
l and have done
 no harm to anyo
ne; why must I s
uffer so? Help m
e!” her look 
seemed to say. S
he saw her husba
"nd, but did not "
realize the sign
ificance of his
 appearance befo
re her now. Prin
ce Andrew went r
ound the sofa an
d kissed her fo
rehead.  “My
 darling!” he 
said—a word he
 had never used 
to her before. 
“God is mercif
ul....”  She
 looked at him i
nquiringly and w
ith childlike re
proach.  “I 
expected help fr
om you and I get
" none, none from"
 you either!” 
 said her eyes. 
She was not surp
rised at his hav
ing come; she di
d not realize t
hat he had come.
 His coming had 
nothing to do wi
th her sufferin
gs or with their
 relief. The pan
gs began again a
nd Mary Bogdán
ovna advised Pri
nce Andrew to le
ave the room.  
 The doctor ente
red. Prince Andr
"ew went out and,"
 meeting Princes
"s Mary,
again j"
oined her. They 
began talking in
" whispers, but t"
heir talk broke 
 off at every mo
ment. They waite
d and listened. 
"

“Go, dear,�"
�� said Princess
 Mary.  Prince
 Andrew went aga
in to his wife a
nd sat waiting i
n the room next 
 to hers. A woma
n came from the 
bedroom with a f
rightened face a
nd became confu
sed when she saw
 Prince Andrew. 
He covered his f
ace with his han
ds and remained
 so for some min
"utes. Piteous, h"
"elpless, animal "
moans came thro
ugh the door. Pr
ince Andrew got 
"up, went to the "
"door, and tried "
to open it. Som
eone was holding
 it shut.  “
You can’t come
 in! You can’t
!” said a terr
ified voice from
 within.  He 
began pacing the
 room. The screa
"ming ceased, and"
 a few more seco
nds went by. Th
en suddenly a te
rrible shriek—
it could not be 
"hers, she
could"
 not scream like
 that—came fro
m the bedroom. P
rince Andrew ran
 to the door; t
he scream ceased
 and he heard th
e wail of an inf
ant.  “What 
have they taken 
a baby in there 
for?” thought 
Prince Andrew in
 the first seco
nd. “A baby? W
hat baby...? Why
 is there a baby
 there? Or is t
he baby born?”
  Then suddenl
y he realized th
e joyful signifi
cance of that wa
il; tears choke
"d him, and leani"
ng his elbows on
 the window sill
 he began to cry
",
sobbing like "
a child. The doo
r opened. The do
ctor with his sh
irt sleeves tuc
"ked up, without "
"a coat, pale and"
 with a tremblin
"g jaw, came out"
 of the room. Pr
ince Andrew turn
"ed to him, but t"
he doctor gave h
im a bewildered
 look and passed
 by without a wo
rd. A woman rush
ed out and seei
ng Prince Andrew
" stopped, hesita"
ting on the thre
shold. He went i
nto his wife’
s room. She was 
"lying dead, in t"
he same position
 he had seen he
r in five minute
"s before and, de"
spite the fixed 
eyes and the pal
lor of the chee
"ks, the same exp"
ression was on h
er charming chil
dlike face with 
 its upper lip c
overed with tiny
 black hair.  
“I love you al
"l, and have done"
 no harm to anyo
ne; and what hav
e you done to m
e?”—said her
" charming, pathe"
"tic, dead face."
  In a corner o
f the room somet
hing red and tin
y gave a grunt a
nd squealed in 
Mary Bogdánovna
’s trembling w
hite hands.   
 Two hours later
" Prince Andrew, "
"stepping softly,"
 went into his f
ather’s room.
 The old man alr
eady knew everyt
hing. He was sta
nding close to 
the door and as 
soon as it opene
d his rough old 
arms closed like
 a vise round h
"is son’s neck,"
 and without a w
ord he began to 
sob like a child
.   Three day
s later the litt
le princess was 
"buried, and Prin"
ce Andrew went 
up the steps to 
where the coffin
" stood, to give "
her the farewell
 kiss. And ther
e in the coffin 
was the same fac
"e, though with c"
losed eyes. “
"Ah, what have yo"
u done to me?”
 it still seemed
" to say, and Pri"
nce Andrew felt
 that something 
gave way in his 
soul and that he
 was guilty of 
a sin he could n
either remedy no
r forget. He cou
ld not weep. The
 old man too ca
me up and kissed
 the waxen littl
e hands that lay
 quietly crosse
d one on the oth
er on her breast
", and to him, to"
"o, her face seem"
ed to say: “A
"h, what have you"
" done to me, and"
 why?” And at 
the sight the o
ld man turned an
grily away.   
 Another five da
"ys passed, and t"
hen the young Pr
ince Nicholas An
dréevich was b
aptized. The wet
 nurse supported
 the coverlet wi
"th her chin, whi"
le the priest w
ith a goose feat
her anointed the
 boy’s little 
red and wrinkle
d soles and palm
s.  His grandf
"ather, who was h"
"is godfather, tr"
embling and afra
id of dropping 
"him, carried the"
 infant round th
e battered tin f
ont and handed h
im over to the 
"godmother, Princ"
ess Mary. Prince
 Andrew sat in a
"nother room,
fa"
int with fear le
st the baby shou
ld be drowned in
" the font, and a"
waited the term
ination of the c
eremony. He look
ed up joyfully a
t the baby when 
 the nurse broug
ht it to him and
 nodded approval
 when she told h
im that the wax
 with the baby�
�s hair had not 
sunk in the font
 but had floated
.      CHA
PTER X  Rostó
v’s share in D
ólokhov’s due
l with Bezúkhov
 was hushed up b
y the efforts o
"f the old count,"
 and instead of 
being degraded t
o the ranks as 
he expected he w
as appointed an 
adjutant to the 
governor general
 of Moscow. As 
a result he coul
d not go to the 
country with the
 rest of the fa
"mily, but was ke"
pt all summer in
 Moscow by his n
ew duties. Dólo
"khov
recovered,"
 and Rostóv bec
ame very friendl
y with him durin
g his convalesc
ence. Dólokhov 
lay ill at his m
other’s who lo
ved him passion
ately and tender
"ly, and old Mary"
" Ivánovna, who "
had grown fond o
f Rostóv for h
is friendship to
" her Fédya, oft"
en talked to him
 about her son.
"

“Yes, Coun"
"t,” she would "
"say, “he is to"
o noble and pure
-souled for our
" present, deprav"
ed world. No one
 now loves virtu
e; it seems like
 a reproach to 
everyone. Now te
"ll me, Count, wa"
"s it right, was "
"it
honorable, o"
f Bezúkhov? And
" Fédya, with hi"
"s noble spirit, "
loved him and e
ven now never sa
ys a word agains
t him. Those pra
nks in Petersbur
g when they pla
yed some tricks 
"on a policeman, "
didn’t they do
 it together? A
nd there! Bezúk
hov got off scot
"free, while Féd"
ya had to bear 
the whole burden
 on his shoulder
s. Fancy what he
 had to go throu
gh! It’s true
 he has been rei
"nstated, but how"
 could they fail
 to do that? I 
think there were
 not many such g
allant sons of t
he fatherland ou
t there as he. 
And now—this d
uel! Have these 
people no feelin
"g, or
honor? Kn"
owing him to be 
"an only son, to "
challenge him an
d shoot so stra
ight! It’s wel
l God had mercy 
on us. And what 
was it for? Who 
 doesn’t have 
intrigues nowada
"ys? Why, if he w"
"as so jealous, a"
s I see things 
he should have s
"hown it sooner, "
but he lets it g
o on for months.
 And then to ca
"ll him out, reck"
oning on Fédya 
not fighting bec
ause he owed hi
m money! What ba
seness! What mea
nness! I know yo
u understand F�
"�dya, my dear co"
"unt; that, belie"
"ve me, is why I "
am so fond of yo
u. Few people d
o understand him
. He is such a l
"ofty, heavenly s"
oul!”  Dólo
khov himself dur
ing his convales
cence spoke to R
ostóv in a way 
no one would ha
ve expected of h
im.  “I know
 people consider
 me a bad man!�
� he said. “Le
t them! I don�
�t care a straw 
about anyone but
 those I love; b
"ut those I love,"
 I love so that
 I would give my
" life for them, "
and the others I
’d throttle i
f they stood in 
my way. I have a
"n adored, a pric"
"eless mother,
a"
nd two or three 
friends—you am
ong them—and a
s for the rest I
 only care abou
t them in so far
 as they are har
mful or useful. 
And most of the
"m are harmful, e"
specially the wo
"men. Yes, dear b"
"oy,” he contin"
"ued,
“I have "
"met loving, nobl"
"e, high-minded m"
"en, but I have n"
ot yet met any 
women—countess
es or cooks—wh
o were not venal
. I have not yet
 met that divin
e purity and dev
otion I look for
 in women. If I 
found such a on
e I’d give my 
life for her! Bu
t those!...” a
nd he made a ges
ture of contemp
t. “And believ
"e me, if I still"
 value my life i
t is only becau
se I still hope 
to meet such a d
"ivine creature, "
who will regene
"rate, purify, an"
d elevate me. Bu
t you don’t un
derstand it.” 
"

“Oh, yes, I"
 quite understan
"d,” answered R"
"ostóv, who was "
under his new f
riend’s influe
nce.  In the a
utumn the Rostó
vs returned to M
oscow. Early in 
the winter Den�
�sov also came b
ack and stayed w
ith them. The fi
rst half of the 
"
winter of 1806,"
 which Nicholas 
Rostóv spent in
" Moscow, was one"
 of the happies
"t, merriest time"
s for him and th
e whole family. 
Nicholas brought
 many young men
 to his parents�
�� house. Véra 
was a handsome g
irl of twenty; 
Sónya a girl of
 sixteen with al
l the charm of a
n opening flowe
"r; Natásha, hal"
f grown up and h
"alf child, was n"
ow childishly a
"musing, now girl"
ishly enchanting
.  At that tim
e in the Rostóv
s’ house there
 prevailed an am
orous atmospher
e characteristic
 of homes where 
there are very y
oung and very c
harming girls. E
very young man w
ho came to the h
ouse—seeing th
ose impressiona
"ble, smiling you"
ng faces (smilin
g probably at th
eir own happine
"ss), feeling the"
 eager bustle ar
"ound him, and he"
aring the fitful
 bursts of song
 and music and t
he inconsequent 
but friendly pra
ttle of young g
irls ready for a
nything and full
 of hope—exper
ienced the same 
 feeling; sharin
g with the young
 folk of the Ros
tóvs’ househo
ld a readiness 
to fall in love 
and an expectati
on of happiness.
  Among the yo
ung men introduc
ed by Rostóv on
e of the first w
"as
Dólokhov, w"
hom everyone in 
the house liked 
except Natásha.
 She almost qua
rreled with her 
brother about hi
m. She insisted 
that he was a ba
"d
man, and that"
 in the duel wit
"h Bezúkhov, Pie"
rre was right an
d Dólokhov wro
"ng, and further "
that he was disa
greeable and unn
atural.  “Th
ere’s nothing 
for me to unders
"tand,” she cri"
ed out with res
"olute self-will,"
 “he is wicked
 and heartless. 
"There now, I lik"
e your Denísov
 though he is a 
rake and all tha
"t, still I like "
him; so you see
 I do understand
. I don’t know
 how to put it..
. with this one 
 everything is c
"alculated, and I"
 don’t like th
at. But Denísov
"...”

“Oh,"
 Denísov is qui
"te different,”"
 replied Nichola
"s, implying that"
 even Denísov 
was nothing comp
ared to Dólokho
v—“you must 
understand what
 a soul there is
" in Dólokhov, y"
ou should see hi
m with his mothe
r. What a heart
"!”

“Well,"
 I don’t know 
"about that, but "
I am uncomfortab
le with him. And
 do you know he
 has fallen in l
ove with Sónya?
”  “What n
onsense...”  
 “I’m certai
n of it; you’l
l see.”  Nat
ásha’s predic
tion proved true
". Dólokhov, who"
 did not usually
 care for the s
ociety of ladies
", began to come "
often to the hou
"se, and the
que"
stion for whose 
sake he came (th
ough no one spok
e of it) was soo
n settled. He c
ame because of S
ónya. And Sóny
"a, though she wo"
uld never have 
"dared to say so,"
 knew it and blu
shed scarlet eve
ry time Dólokho
v appeared.  
Dólokhov often 
dined at the Ros
"tóvs’, never "
missed a perform
ance at which t
hey were present
", and went to Io"
gel’s balls fo
r young people 
which the Rostó
vs always attend
ed. He was point
edly attentive t
o Sónya and lo
oked at her in s
uch a way that n
ot only could sh
e not bear his 
glances without 
"coloring, but ev"
en the old count
ess and Natásha
 blushed when t
hey saw his look
s.  It was evi
dent that this s
"trange, strong m"
an was under the
 irresistible i
nfluence of the 
"dark, graceful g"
irl who loved an
other.  Rostó
v noticed someth
ing new in Dólo
khov’s relatio
"ns with Sónya,"
 but he did not 
explain to himse
lf what these ne
w relations were
. “They’re 
always in love w
"ith someone,” "
he thought of S�
�nya and Natás
ha. But he was n
ot as much at ea
se with Sónya a
nd Dólokhov as 
 before and was 
less frequently 
at home.  In t
he autumn of 180
6 everybody had 
again begun talk
ing of the war w
ith Napoleon wi
th even greater 
warmth than the 
year before. Ord
ers were given 
to raise recruit
"s, ten men in ev"
ery thousand for
 the regular arm
"y,
and besides "
"this, nine men i"
n every thousand
 for the militia
. Everywhere Bo
naparte was anat
hematized and in
 Moscow nothing 
but the coming w
ar was talked o
f. For the Rost�
�v family the wh
ole interest of 
these preparati
ons for war lay 
in the fact that
 Nicholas would 
not hear of rem
aining in Moscow
", and only await"
ed the terminati
on of Denísov�
�s furlough aft
er Christmas to 
return with him 
to their regimen
t. His approach
ing departure di
d not prevent hi
s amusing himsel
"f, but rather
g"
ave zest to his 
pleasures. He sp
ent the greater 
part of his time
 away from home
", at dinners, pa"
"rties, and balls"
.      CHA
PTER XI  On th
e third day afte
r Christmas Nich
olas dined at ho
"me, a thing he h"
ad rarely done 
of late. It was 
a grand farewell
" dinner, as he a"
nd Denísov wer
e leaving to joi
n their regiment
 after Epiphany.
 About twenty pe
ople were prese
"nt, including D�"
�lokhov and Den�
�sov.  Never h
ad love been so 
"much in the air,"
 and never had t
he amorous atmo
sphere made itse
lf so strongly f
elt in the Rost�
�vs’ house as 
at this holiday
 time. “Seize 
the moments of h
"appiness, love a"
nd be loved! Th
at is the only r
eality in the wo
"rld, all else is"
 folly. It is th
e one thing we 
are interested i
"n here,” said "
the spirit of th
e place.  Nich
"olas, having as "
usual exhausted 
two pairs of hor
"ses, without
vi"
siting all the p
laces he meant t
o go to and wher
e he had been in
"vited,
returned"
 home just befor
e dinner. As soo
n as he entered 
he noticed and 
felt the tension
 of the amorous 
air in the house
", and also notic"
ed a curious em
barrassment amon
g some of those 
"present. Sónya,"
" Dólokhov,
and"
 the old countes
s were especiall
"y disturbed, and"
 to a lesser deg
ree Natásha. N
icholas understo
od that somethin
g must have happ
ened between S�
�nya and Dólokh
ov before dinner
", and with the k"
indly sensitiven
ess natural to 
him was very gen
tle and wary wit
h them both at d
inner. On that 
same evening the
re was to be one
 of the balls th
at Iogel (the d
ancing master) g
ave for his pupi
ls during the ho
lidays.  “Ni
"cholas, will you"
 come to Iogel�
�s? Please do!�
� said Natásha.
 “He asked yo
"u, and Vasíli D"
mítrich * is al
so going.”  
    * Denísov. 
  “Where woul
d I not go at th
e countess’ co
mmand!” said D
"enísov,
who at"
 the Rostóvs’
 had jocularly a
ssumed the role 
of Natásha’s 
 knight. “I’
m even weady to 
dance the pas de
 châle.”  �
��If I have time
",” answered Ni"
cholas. “But I
 promised the A
rkhárovs; they 
have a party.”
  “And you?�
�� he asked Dól
"okhov, but as so"
on as he had ask
ed the question
 he noticed that
 it should not h
ave been put.  
"
“Perhaps,” "
coldly and angri
ly replied Dólo
"khov, glancing a"
"t Sónya,
and, "
"scowling, he gav"
e Nicholas just 
such a look as h
e had given Pier
re at the club 
dinner.  “Th
ere is something
" up,” thought "
"Nicholas, and he"
 was further co
nfirmed in this 
conclusion by th
e fact that Dól
okhov left immed
iately after di
nner. He called 
Natásha and ask
ed her what was 
the matter.  �
��And I was look
"ing for you,” "
said Natásha ru
nning out to him
. “I told you
", but you would "
"not believe it,�"
�� she said triu
mphantly. “He 
 has proposed to
 Sónya!”  L
ittle as Nichola
s had occupied h
imself with Són
"ya of late, some"
thing seemed to
 give way within
 him at this new
s. Dólokhov was
 a suitable and 
 in some respect
s a brilliant ma
tch for the dowe
"rless, orphan gi"
rl. From the po
int of view of t
he old countess 
and of society i
t was out of the
 question for h
er to refuse him
. And therefore 
Nicholas’ firs
t feeling on he
aring the news w
as one of anger 
with Sónya.... 
"He tried to say,"
 “That’s ca
pital; of course
 she’ll forget
 her childish pr
omises and acce
"pt the offer,”"
 but before he h
ad time to say i
t Natásha began
 again.  “A
nd fancy! she re
fused him quite 
definitely!” a
"dding, after a
"
"pause, “she to"
ld him she loved
 another.”  
"“Yes, my Sóny"
a could not have
 done otherwise!
” thought Nich
olas.  “Much
 as Mamma presse
"d her, she refus"
"ed, and I know s"
he won’t chang
e once she has 
said...”  �
�And Mamma press
ed her!” said 
Nicholas reproac
hfully.  “Ye
"s,” said Natá"
sha. “Do you k
"now, Nicholas—"
don’t be angr
y—but I know y
ou will not marr
"y her. I know, h"
"eaven knows how,"
 but I know for
 certain that yo
u won’t marry 
her.”  “No
w you don’t kn
ow that at all!�
�� said Nicholas
. “But I must 
 talk to her. Wh
at a darling Só
nya is!” he ad
ded with a smile
".

“Ah, she "
is indeed a darl
ing! I’ll send
 her to you.” 
  And Natásha 
kissed her broth
er and ran away.
  A minute lat
er Sónya came i
n with a frighte
"ned, guilty, and"
 scared look. N
icholas went up 
to her and kisse
d her hand. This
 was the first 
time since his r
eturn that they 
had talked alone
 and about their
 love.  “Sop
"hie,” he began"
", timidly at fir"
st and then more
 and more boldl
"y, “if you wis"
h to refuse one 
who is not only 
a brilliant and 
 advantageous ma
tch but a splend
"id, noble fellow"
... he is my fri
end...”  Só
nya interrupted 
him.  “I hav
e already refuse
"d,” she said h"
urriedly.  “
If you are refus
"ing for my sake,"
 I am afraid tha
t I...”  Só
nya again interr
upted. She gave 
him an imploring
", frightened loo"
k.  “Nichola
"s, don’t tell "
me that!” she 
"said.

“No, "
but I must. It m
ay be arrogant o
"f me, but still "
it is best to sa
y it. If you re
fuse him on my a
"ccount, I must t"
ell you the whol
e truth. I love
" you, and I thin"
k I love you mor
e than anyone el

That is enough f
"or me,” said S"
"ónya, blushing."
"

“No, but I"
 have been in lo
ve a thousand ti
mes and shall fa
ll in love agai
"n, though for no"
 one have I such
 a feeling of fr
"iendship,
confi"
"dence, and love "

not wish it. In 
"a word, I make n"

 beg you to cons

"��s offer,” he"
" said, articulat"

fficulty.  “
Don’t say that
 to me! I want n

 “You are an

    CHAPTER 
XII  Iogel’s
 were the most e
njoyable balls i
n Moscow. So sai
d the mothers a
s they watched t
heir young peopl
e executing thei
r newly learned 
"steps,
and so s"
aid the youths a
nd maidens thems
elves as they da
nced till they 
were ready to dr
"op, and so said "
the grown-up you
ng men and women
 who came to th
ese balls with a
n air of condesc
ension and found
 them most enjo
yable. That year
 two marriages h
ad come of these
 balls. The two 
 pretty young Pr
incesses Gorchak
óv met suitors 
there and were m
arried and so f
urther increased
 the fame of the
se dances. What 
distinguished t
hem from others 
was the absence 
of host or hoste
ss and the prese
nce of the good
"-natured Iogel, "
flying about lik
e a feather and 
bowing according
 to the rules o
"f his art, as he"
 collected the t
ickets from all 
his visitors. T
here was the fac
t that only thos
e came who wishe
d to dance and 
amuse themselves
 as girls of thi
rteen and fourte
en do who are w
earing long dres
ses for the firs
t time. With sca
rcely any except
ions they all w
"ere, or seemed t"
"o be, pretty—s"
o rapturous were
 their smiles a
nd so sparkling 
their eyes. Some
times the best o
"f the pupils, of"
" whom
Natásha,"
 who was excepti
"onally graceful,"
" was first, even"
 danced the pas 
"
de châle, but "
at this last bal
l only the écos
"saise, the angla"
"ise, and
the ma"
"zurka, which was"
 just coming int
"o fashion, were "
danced. Iogel ha
d taken a ballr
oom in Bezúkhov
"’s house, and "
"the ball, as eve"
"ryone said,
was"
 a great success
. There were man
y pretty girls a
nd the Rostóv g
irls were among
 the prettiest. 
They were both p
articularly happ
y and gay. That
" evening, proud "
of Dólokhov’s
" proposal, her r"
"efusal, and her"
 explanation wit
"h Nicholas, Són"
ya twirled about
 before she left
 home so that t
he maid could ha
rdly get her hai
"r plaited, and s"
he was transpar
ently radiant wi
th impulsive joy
.  Natásha no
 less proud of h
er first long dr
ess and of being
 at a real ball
 was even happie
r. They were bot
h dressed in whi
te muslin with p
ink ribbons.  
 Natásha fell i
n love the very 
moment she enter
ed the ballroom.
 She was not in
 love with anyon
"e in particular,"
 but with everyo
ne. Whatever pe
rson she happene
d to look at she
 was in love wit
h for that momen
"t.

“Oh, how"
 delightful it i
s!” she kept s
"aying, running u"
p to Sónya.  
Nicholas and Den
ísov were walki
"ng up and down, "
looking with kin
dly patronage a
t the dancers. 
 “How sweet s
he is—she will
 be a weal beaut
y!” said Dení
sov.  “Who?�
��  “Countes
"s Natásha,” a"
nswered Denísov
.  “And how 
she dances! What
 gwace!” he sa
id again after a
 pause.  “Wh
o are you talkin
g about?”  �
��About your sis
"ter,” ejaculat"
ed Denísov test
ily.  Rostóv 
smiled.  “My
" dear count, you"
 were one of my 
best pupils—yo
"u must dance,”"
 said little Io
gel coming up to
 Nicholas. “Lo
ok how many char
ming young ladi
es—” He turn
ed with the same
 request to Den�
�sov who was als
o a former pupi
l of his.  “
"No, my dear fell"
"ow, I’ll be a "
"wallflower,” s"
aid Denísov. �
��Don’t you we
collect what bad
 use I made of y
our lessons?” 
  “Oh no!” 
"said Iogel, hast"
ening to reassur
e him. “You we
re only inatten
"tive, but you ha"
d talent—oh ye
"s, you had talen"
t!”  The ban
d struck up the 
newly introduced
 mazurka. Nichol
as could not re
fuse Iogel and a
sked Sónya to d
ance. Denísov s
at down by the o
"ld
ladies and, "
leaning on his s
aber and beating
 time with his f
"oot, told
them "
something funny 
and kept them am
"used, while he w"
atched the young
 people dancing
", Iogel with Nat"
"ásha, his pride"
 and his best pu
"pil, were
the f"
irst couple. Noi
"selessly, skillf"
ully stepping wi
th his little f
eet in low shoes
", Iogel flew fir"
st across the ha
ll with Natásha
", who,
though s"
"hy, went on care"
fully executing 
her steps. Dení
sov did not tak
e his eyes off h
er and beat time
 with his saber 
in a way that cl
early indicated
 that if he was 
not dancing it w
as because he wo
uld not and not 
 because he coul
d not. In the mi
ddle of a figure
 he beckoned to 
Rostóv who was
 passing:  “
This is not at a
"ll the thing,”"
 he said. “Wha
t sort of Polish
 mazuwka is thi
s? But she does 
dance splendidly
.”  Knowing 
that Denísov ha
d a reputation e
ven in Poland fo
r the masterly 
way in which he 
danced the mazur
"ka, Nicholas ran"
 up to Natásha:
  “Go and ch
oose Denísov. H
e is a real danc
"er, a wonder!”"
 he said.  Whe
n it came to Nat
ásha’s turn t
o choose a partn
"er, she rose and"
",
tripping rapi"
dly across in he
r little shoes t
rimmed with bows
", ran
timidly t"
o the corner whe
re Denísov sat.
 She saw that ev
erybody was loo
king at her and 
waiting. Nichola
s saw that Dení
sov was refusing
 though he smil
ed delightedly. 
He ran up to the
"m.

“Please,"
 Vasíli Dmítri
"ch,” Natásha "
"was saying, “d"
o come!”  �
"�Oh no, let me o"
"ff, Countess,”"
 Denísov replie
d.  “Now the
"n, Váska,” sa"
id Nicholas.  
“They coax me 
as if I were Vá
ska the cat!” 
said Denísov jo
kingly.  “I�
��ll sing for yo
u a whole evenin
"g,” said Natá"
"sha.

“Oh, t"
he faiwy! She ca
n do anything wi
th me!” said D
"enísov, and
he"
 unhooked his sa
ber. He came out
 from behind the
" chairs, clasped"
 his partner’
"s hand firmly, t"
hrew back his he
"ad, and advanced"
" his foot,
wait"
ing for the beat
. Only on horse 
back and in the 
mazurka was Den
ísov’s short 
stature not noti
ceable and he lo
oked the fine fe
llow he felt hi
mself to be. At 
the right beat o
f the music he l
ooked sideways 
at his partner w
ith a merry and 
"triumphant air, "
suddenly stamped
" with
one foot,"
 bounded from th
e floor like a b
"all, and flew ro"
und the room ta
king his partner
 with him. He gl
ided silently on
 one foot half a
"cross
the room,"
 and seeming not
 to notice the c
hairs was dashin
g straight at t
"hem, when sudden"
"ly, clinking his"
 spurs and sprea
ding out his leg
"s,
he stopped s"
hort on his heel
"s, stood so a se"
"cond, stamped on"
 the spot clank
"ing his spurs, w"
hirled rapidly r
"ound, and, strik"
ing his left hee
l against his r
"ight, flew round"
 again in a circ
le. Natásha gue
ssed what he me
"ant to do, and a"
bandoning hersel
f to him followe
d his lead hardl
y knowing how. 
First he spun he
"r round, holding"
 her now with hi
"s left, now
wit"
h his right hand
", then falling o"
n one knee he tw
irled her round 
"him,
and again "
"jumping up, dash"
ed so impetuousl
y forward that i
t seemed as if 
he would rush th
rough the whole 
suite of rooms w
ithout drawing b
"reath,
and then"
 he suddenly sto
pped and perform
ed some new and 
unexpected step
"s. When at last,"
 smartly whirlin
g his partner ro
und in front of 
"her
chair, he d"
rew up with a cl
ick of his spurs
 and bowed to he
"r, Natásha
did"
 not even make h
im a curtsy. She
 fixed her eyes 
on him in amazem
"ent,
smiling as"
 if she did not 
recognize him. 
 “What does t
his mean?” she
 brought out.  
 Although Iogel 
did not acknowle
dge this to be t
"he real mazurka,"
 everyone was d
elighted with De
nísov’s skill
", he was asked a"
gain and again a
"s
a partner, an"
d the old men be
gan smilingly to
 talk about Pola
nd and the good
 old days. Dení
"sov, flushed aft"
er the mazurka a
nd mopping himse
lf with his han
"dkerchief, sat d"
own by Natásha 
and did not leav
e her for the r
est of the eveni
ng.      C
HAPTER XIII  F
or two days afte
r that Rostóv d
id not see Dólo
khov at his own 
or at Dólokhov
’s home: on th
e third day he r
eceived a note f
rom him:  As I
 do not intend t
o be at your hou
se again for rea
sons you know o
"f, and am going "
to rejoin my reg
"iment, I am givi"
ng a farewell su
pper tonight to
 my friends—co
me to the Englis
h Hotel.  Abou
t ten o’clock 
Rostóv went to 
the English Hote
l straight from 
"the
theater, wh"
ere he had been 
with his family 
and Denísov. He
 was at once sh
own to the best 
"room, which Dól"
okhov had taken 
for that evening
. Some twenty m
en were gathered
 round a table a
t which Dólokho
v sat between t
wo candles. On t
he table was a p
ile of gold and 
"paper money, and"
 he was keeping
 the bank. Rost�
�v had not seen 
him since his pr
oposal and Són
ya’s refusal a
nd felt uncomfor
table at the tho
ught of how they
 would meet.  
 Dólokhov’s c
"lear, cold glanc"
e met Rostóv as
 soon as he ente
"red the
door, a"
s though he had 
long expected hi
m.  “It’s 
a long time sinc
"e we met,” he "
said. “Thanks 
for coming. I�
�ll just finish 
"dealing, and the"
n Ilyúshka will
 come with his 
chorus.”  �
�I called once o
r twice at your 
"house,” said R"
"ostóv, reddenin"
g.  Dólokhov 
made no reply. 
 “You may pun
"t,” he said.
"
 Rostóv recall
ed at that momen
t a strange conv
ersation he had 
once had with D
ólokhov. “Non
e but fools trus
t to luck in pla
"y,” Dólokhov"
 had then said. 
  “Or are you
 afraid to play 
with me?” Dól
okhov now asked 
as if guessing 
Rostóv’s thou
ght.  Beneath 
his smile Rostó
v saw in him the
 mood he had sho
wn at the club 
dinner and at ot
"her times, when "
as if tired of e
veryday life he 
had felt a need
 to escape from 
it by some stran
"ge, and usually "
"cruel, action.
"
 Rostóv felt i
ll at ease. He t
"ried, but failed"
", to find some j"
oke with which 
to reply to Dól
okhov’s words.
 But before he h
ad thought of a
"nything, Dólokh"
"ov, looking stra"
ight in his face
", said slowly an"
d deliberately 
so that everyone
 could hear:  
“Do you rememb
er we had a talk
 about cards... 
‘He’s a fool
 who trusts to 
"luck, one should"
" make certain,�"
� and I want to 
try.”  “To
 try his luck or
 the certainty?�
�� Rostóv asked
 himself.  “
"Well, you’d be"
"tter not play,�"
� Dólokhov adde
"d, and springing"
 a new pack of 
cards said: “B
"ank, gentlemen!�"
��  Moving the
 money forward h
e prepared to de
al. Rostóv sat 
down by his sid
e and at first d
id not play. Dó
lokhov kept glan
cing at him.  
“Why don’t y
ou play?” he a
sked.  And str
ange to say Nich
olas felt that h
e could not help
 taking up a ca
"rd, putting a sm"
"all stake on it,"
 and beginning t
o play.  “I 
have no money wi
"th me,” he sai"
d.  “I’ll 
trust you.”  
 Rostóv staked 
five rubles on a
" card and lost, "
"staked again, an"
d again lost. D
ólokhov “kill
"ed,” that is, "
"beat, ten cards "
of Rostóv’s 
running.  “G
"entlemen,” sai"
d Dólokhov afte
r he had dealt f
or some time. �
��Please place y
our money on the
 cards or I may 
get muddled in t
he reckoning.�
�  One of the 
players said he 
hoped he might b
e trusted.  �
"�Yes, you might,"
 but I am afraid
 of getting the 
accounts mixed. 
So I ask you to
 put the money o
"n your cards,”"
 replied Dólokh
ov. “Don’t 
"stint yourself, "
we’ll settle a
"fterwards,” he"
" added, turning "
to Rostóv.  
The game continu
ed; a waiter kep
t handing round 
champagne.  Al
l Rostóv’s ca
rds were beaten 
and he had eight
 hundred rubles 
scored up again
st him. He wrote
 “800 rubles�
"� on a card, but"
 while the wait
er filled his gl
ass he changed h
is mind and alte
red it to his us
ual stake of tw
enty rubles.  
"“Leave it,” "
"said Dólokhov, "
though he did no
t seem to be eve
n looking at Ro
"stóv, “you’"
ll win it back a
ll the sooner. I
 lose to the ot
hers but win fro
m you. Or are yo
u afraid of me?�
�� he asked agai
n.  Rostóv su
bmitted. He let 
the eight hundre
d remain and lai
d down a seven 
of hearts with a
" torn corner, wh"
ich he had picke
d up from the fl
oor. He well re
membered that se
ven afterwards. 
He laid down the
 seven of hearts
",
on which with"
 a broken bit of
 chalk he had wr
itten “800 rub
les” in clear
 upright figures
; he emptied the
 glass of warm c
hampagne that wa
"s
handed him, s"
miled at Dólokh
"ov’s words, an"
d with a sinking
" heart,
waiting"
 for a seven to 
"turn up, gazed a"
t Dólokhov’s 
hands which held
 the pack. Much
 depended on Ros
tóv’s winning
 or losing on th
at seven of hea
rts. On the prev
ious Sunday the 
old count had gi
ven his son two
 thousand rubles
", and though he "
always disliked 
speaking of mone
y difficulties 
had told Nichola
s that this was 
all he could let
 him have till 
"May, and asked h"
im to be more ec
onomical this ti
me. Nicholas had
 replied that i
t would be more 
than enough for 
him and that he 
gave his word o
f honor not to t
ake anything mor
e till the sprin
g. Now only twel
ve hundred rubl
es was left of t
"hat money, so th"
at this seven of
 hearts meant f
or him not only 
the loss of sixt
een hundred rubl
"es, but the
nec"
essity of going 
back on his word
. With a sinking
 heart he watche
d Dólokhov’s
 hands and thoug
"ht, “Now then,"
 make haste and 
let me have thi
s card and I’l
l take my cap an
d drive home to 
supper with Den�
"�sov,
Natásha,"
" and Sónya, and"
 will certainly 
never touch a ca
rd again.” At 
 that moment his
" home life, joke"
"s with Pétya, t"
alks with Sónya
", duets
with Na"
"tásha, piquet w"
"ith his father, "
and even his com
fortable bed in
 the house on th
e Povarskáya ro
se before him wi
th such vividnes
"s,
clearness, a"
nd charm that it
 seemed as if it
 were all a lost
 and unapprecia
"ted bliss, long "
past. He could n
ot conceive that
 a stupid chanc
"e, letting the s"
even be dealt to
 the right rathe
r than to the le
"ft,
might depri"
ve him of all th
"is happiness, ne"
wly appreciated 
and newly illum
"ined, and plunge"
 him into the de
pths of unknown 
and undefined m
isery. That coul
"d not be, yet he"
 awaited with a 
sinking heart th
e movement of D
ólokhov’s han
"ds. Those broad,"
" reddish hands, "
with hairy wris
ts visible from 
under the shirt 
"cuffs, laid down"
 the pack and to
ok up a glass a
nd a pipe that w
ere handed him. 
  “So you are
 not afraid to p
lay with me?” 
repeated Dólokh
"ov, and as
if a"
bout to tell a g
ood story he put
" down the cards,"
 leaned back in 
"his
chair, and "
began deliberate
ly with a smile:
"

“Yes, gent"
"lemen, I’ve be"
en told there’
s a rumor going 
about Moscow th
at I’m a sharp
"er, so I advise "
you to be carefu
l.”  “Come
" now, deal!” e"
xclaimed Rostóv
".

“Oh, thos"
e Moscow gossips
!” said Dólok
"hov, and he took"
 up the cards w
ith a smile.  
“Aah!” Rost�
�v almost scream
ed lifting both 
hands to his hea
d. The seven he
 needed was lyin
"g uppermost, the"
 first card in t
he pack. He had 
 lost more than 
he could pay.  
"
“Still, don�"
�t ruin yourself
!” said Dólok
hov with a side 
glance at Rost�
�v as he continu
ed to deal.   
    CHAPTER X
IV  An hour an
d a half later m
ost of the playe
rs were but litt
le interested i
n their own play
.  The whole i
nterest was conc
entrated on Rost
óv. Instead of 
sixteen hundred
 rubles he had a
 long column of 
figures scored a
"gainst him,
whi"
ch he had reckon
ed up to ten tho
"usand, but that "
"now, as he vague"
"ly
supposed, mu"
st have risen to
 fifteen thousan
d. In reality it
 already exceed
ed twenty thousa
nd rubles. Dólo
khov was no long
er listening to 
 stories or tell
"ing them, but fo"
llowed every mov
ement of Rostóv
’s hands and 
occasionally ran
 his eyes over t
he score against
 him. He had de
cided to play un
til that score r
eached forty-thr
ee thousand. He 
 had fixed on th
at number becaus
e forty-three wa
s the sum of his
 and Sónya’s
 joint ages. Ros
"tóv, leaning hi"
s head on both h
"ands, sat at
th"
e table which wa
s scrawled over 
"with figures, we"
t with spilled w
"ine,
and litter"
ed with cards. O
ne tormenting im
pression did not
 leave him: tha
t those broad-bo
ned reddish hand
s with hairy wri
sts visible from
 under the shir
"t sleeves, those"
 hands which he 
"loved and hated,"
 held him in th
eir power.  �
�Six hundred rub
"les, ace, a corn"
"er, a nine... wi"
nning it back’
s impossible...
" Oh, how pleasan"
t it was at home
"!... The knave, "
double or quits
... it can’t b
e!... And why is
 he doing this t
o me?” Rostóv
 pondered. Some
times he staked 
"a large sum, but"
 Dólokhov refus
ed to accept it
 and fixed the s
take himself. Ni
cholas submitted
" to him, and at"
 one moment pray
ed to God as he 
had done on the 
battlefield at t
he bridge over 
"the Enns, and th"
en guessed that 
the card that ca
me first to hand
 from the crump
led heap under t
he table would s
"ave him, now cou"
nted the cords 
on his coat and 
took a card with
 that number and
 tried staking t
he total of his
" losses on it, t"
hen he looked ro
und for aid from
 the other play
"ers, or peered a"
t the now cold f
ace of Dólokhov
 and tried to re
ad what was pas
sing in his mind
.  “He knows
 of course what 
this loss means 
to me. He can’
t want my ruin.
 Wasn’t he my 
friend? Wasn’t
 I fond of him? 
But it’s not h
is fault. What�
��s he to do if 
he has such luck
?... And it’s 
not my fault ei
"ther,” he thou"
"ght to himself, "
“I have done n
othing wrong. Ha
ve I killed any
"one, or insulted"
 or wished harm 
to anyone? Why s
uch a terrible 
misfortune? And 
when did it begi
n? Such a little
 while ago I cam
e to this table
 with the though
t of winning a h
undred rubles to
 buy that caske
t for Mamma’s 
name day and the
n going home. I 
"was so happy, so"

id not realize h

When did that e
nd and when did 
"this new, terrib"

gile hands in th
e same way. Whe
n did it happen 
and what has hap
pened? I am well
 and strong and
 still the same 
and in the same 
"place. No, it ca"
n’t be! Surely
 it will all en
d in nothing!”
  He was flush
ed and bathed in
" perspiration, t"
hough the room w
as not hot. His
 face was terrib
le and piteous t
"o see, especiall"
y from its helpl
ess efforts to 
seem calm.  Th
e score against 
him reached the 
fateful sum of f
orty-three thous
and. Rostóv ha
d just prepared 
"a card, by bendi"
ng the corner of
 which he meant
 to double the t
hree thousand ju
st put down to h
"is score, when
"
"Dólokhov, slamm"
ing down the pac
"k of cards, put "
it aside and beg
an rapidly addi
ng up the total 
of Rostóv’s d
"ebt, breaking th"
e chalk as he m
arked the figure
"s in his clear, "
bold hand.  �
"�Supper, it’s "
time for supper!
 And here are th
e gypsies!”  
 Some swarthy me
n and women were
 really entering
 from the cold o
utside and sayi
ng something in 
their gypsy acce
nts. Nicholas un
derstood that it
 was all over; 
but he said in a
n indifferent to
"ne:

“Well, "
won’t you go o
n? I had a splen
did card all rea
"dy,” as if it"
 were the fun of
 the game which 
interested him m
ost.  “It’
s all up! I’m 
lost!” thought
 he. “Now a bu
llet through my 
 brain—that’
s all that’s l
eft me!” And a
t the same time 
he said in a ch
eerful voice:  
"
“Come now, ju"
st this one more
 little card!”
  “All right
!” said Dólok
"hov, having fini"
shed the additio
n. “All right
! Twenty-one rub
"les,” he said,"
 pointing to the
 figure twenty-o
ne by which the
 total exceeded 
the round sum of
 forty-three tho
usand; and taki
ng up a pack he 
prepared to deal
. Rostóv submis
sively unbent th
e corner of his
" card and, inste"
ad of the six th
ousand he had in
"tended,
careful"
ly wrote twenty-
one.  “It’
s all the same t
"o me,” he said"
. “I only want
 to see whether 
 you will let me
" win this ten, o"
r beat it.”  
 Dólokhov began
 to deal serious
"ly. Oh, how Rost"
óv detested at 
that moment tho
se hands with th
eir short reddis
h fingers and ha
"iry wrists,
whi"
ch held him in t
heir power.... T
he ten fell to h
im.  “You ow
e forty-three th
"ousand, Count,�"
� said Dólokhov
", and
stretchin"
g himself he ros
e from the table
. “One does ge
t tired sitting 
"
so long,” he "
added.  “Yes
", I’m tired to"
"o,” said Rost�"
�v.  Dólokhov
" cut him short, "
as if to remind 
him that it was 
not for him to 
jest.  “When
 am I to receive
" the money, Coun"
t?”  Rostóv
", flushing, drew"
 Dólokhov into 
the next room. 
 “I cannot pa
y it all immedia
tely. Will you t
ake an I.O.U.?�
� he said.  �
"�I say, Rostóv,"
” said Dólokh
"ov clearly, smil"
ing and looking 
 Nicholas straig
"ht in the eyes, "
“you know the 
"saying, ‘Lucky"
" in love,
unluc"
ky at cards.’ 
Your cousin is i
"n love with you,"
 I know.”  �
"��Oh, it’s ter"
rible to feel on
eself so in this
" man’s power,�"
�� thought Rost
óv. He knew wha
t a shock he wou
ld inflict on hi
s father and mo
ther by the news
" of this loss, h"
e knew what a re
lief it would be
 to escape it a
"ll, and felt tha"
t Dólokhov knew
 that he could s
ave him from al
l this shame and
" sorrow, but wan"
ted now to play 
with him as a ca
t does with a m
ouse.  “Your
 cousin...” D�
�lokhov started 
"to say, but Nich"
olas interrupted
 him.  “My 
cousin has nothi
ng to do with th
is and it’s no
t necessary to 
mention her!” 
he exclaimed fie
rcely.  “The
n when am I to h
ave it?”  �
"�Tomorrow,” re"
plied Rostóv an
d left the room.
      CHAP
TER XV  To say
 “tomorrow” 
and keep up a di

" not difficult,"
 but to go home 
"alone, see his s"

At home, th"
ey had not yet g

"young people, af"
ter returning f
"rom the theater,"
 had had supper 
and were grouped
 round the clavi

".
Denísov, wit"

avichord striki

is short fingers

eyes rolling as 
"he sang, with hi"
"s small, husky, "
"but true voice, "
some verses cal
led “Enchantre
"ss,” which he "
"had composed, an"
d to which he w
as trying to fit
 music:     En
"chantress, say, "
to my forsaken l

ic power is this
 recalls me stil
l?    What spar
k has set my inm
ost soul on fire
",
   What is th"
is bliss that ma
kes my fingers t

 singing in pass
"ionate tones, ga"
zing with his sp
arkling black-a
gate eyes at the
 frightened and 
happy Natásha. 
  “Splendid! 
Excellent!” ex
claimed Natásha
. “Another ver
"se,” she
said"
", without notici"
ng Nicholas.  
“Everything’
s still the same
" with them,” t"
"hought Nicholas,"
 glancing into 
the drawing room
", where he saw V"
éra and his mot
her with the ol
d lady.  “Ah
", and here’s N"
icholas!” crie
"d Natásha, runn"
ing up to him. 
 “Is Papa at 
home?” he aske
d.  “I am so
 glad you’ve c
ome!” said Nat
"ásha, without a"
nswering him. �
��We are enjoyin

"w?”

“No, "
Papa is not back
" yet,” said S�"
�nya.  “Nich
"olas, have you c"
"ome? Come here, "
dear!” called 
the old countess
 from the drawi
ng room.  Nich
olas went to her
", kissed her han"
"d, and sitting d"
own silently at 
her table began
 to watch her ha
nds arranging th
e cards. From th
"e dancing
room,"
 they still hear
d the laughter a
nd merry voices 
trying to persua
de Natásha to 
sing.  “All 
wight! All wight
!” shouted Den
ísov. “It’s
 no good making 
 excuses now! It
’s your turn t
o sing the ba’
cawolla—I entw
eat you!”  
The countess gla
nced at her sile
nt son.  “Wh
at is the matter
?” she asked. 
"

“Oh, nothin"
"g,” said he, a"
s if weary of be
ing continually 
asked the same 
question. “Wil
l Papa be back s
oon?”  “I 
expect so.”  
 “Everything�
�s the same with
 them. They know
 nothing about i
t! Where am I t
o go?” thought
" Nicholas, and w"
ent again into t
he dancing room 
 where the clavi
chord stood.  
Sónya was sitti
ng at the clavic
"hord, playing th"
e prelude to De
nísov’s favor
ite barcarolle. 
Natásha was pre
paring to sing. 
 Denísov was lo
oking at her wit
h enraptured eye
s.  Nicholas b
egan pacing up a
nd down the room
.  “Why do t
hey want to make
 her sing? How c
an she sing? The
re’s nothing 
to be happy abou
t!” thought he
.  Sónya stru
ck the first cho
rd of the prelud
"e.

“My God,"
 I’m a ruined 
and dishonored m
an! A bullet thr
ough my brain i
s the only thing
 left me—not s
inging!” his t
houghts ran on. 
“Go away? But
 where to? It’
s one—let them
 sing!”  He 
continued to pac
"e the room, look"
ing gloomily at 
Denísov and the
 girls and avoi
ding their eyes.
  “Nikólenk
"a, what is the m"
atter?” Sónya
’s eyes fixed 
on him seemed t
o ask. She notic
ed at once that 
something had ha
ppened to him. 
 Nicholas turne
d away from her.
" Natásha too, w"
ith her quick in
"stinct,
had ins"
tantly noticed h
er brother’s c
"ondition. But, t"
hough she notice
"d
it, she was h"
erself in such h
igh spirits at t
"hat moment, so f"
"ar from
sorrow,"
" sadness, or sel"
"f-reproach, that"
 she purposely d
eceived herself 
 as young people
 often do. “No
", I am too happy"
 now to spoil my
 enjoyment by s
ympathy with any
"one’s sorrow,�"
"�� she felt, and"
 she said to he
"rself: “No, I "
must be mistaken
", he must be fee"
"ling happy, just"
 as I am.”  
"
“Now, Sónya!"
"” she said, go"
ing to the very 
middle of the ro
"om, where
she c"
onsidered the re
sonance was best
.  Having lift
ed her head and 
let her arms dro
"op lifelessly, a"
s ballet dancer
"s do, Natásha, "
rising energetic
ally from her he
"els to her toes,"
 stepped to the
 middle of the r
oom and stood st
"ill.

“Yes, "
that’s me!” 
she seemed to sa
"y, answering the"
 rapt gaze with 
 which Denísov 
followed her.  
 “And what is 
she so pleased a
bout?” thought
" Nicholas, looki"
ng at his siste
r. “Why isn’
t she dull and a
shamed?”  Na
tásha took the 
"first note, her "
"throat swelled, "
"her chest rose,"
 her eyes became
 serious. At tha
t moment she was
 oblivious of he
"r
surroundings,"
 and from her sm
iling lips flowe
d sounds which a
nyone may produ
ce at the same i
ntervals and hol
d for the same t
"ime, but which
"
leave you cold a
 thousand times 
and the thousand
 and first time 
thrill you and 
make you weep. 
"
Natásha, that"
" winter, had for"
 the first time 
begun to sing se
"riously,
mainly"
 because Deníso
v so delighted i
n her singing. S
he no longer san
"g
as a child, t"
here was no long
er in her singin
"g that comical, "
"childish,
pains"
taking effect th
at had been in i
t before; but sh
e did not yet si
"ng
well, as all"
 the connoisseur
s who heard her 
said: “It is n
"ot trained,
but"
 it is a beautif
ul voice that mu
st be trained.�
� Only they gene
rally said this
 some time after
 she had finishe
d singing. While
 that untrained 
"
voice, with its"
 incorrect breat
hing and labored
" transitions, wa"
"s
sounding, eve"
n the connoisseu
"rs said nothing,"
 but only deligh
ted in it and w
ished to hear it
 again. In her v
oice there was a
 virginal fresh
"ness, an unconsc"
iousness of her 
"own powers, and "
an as yet untrai
ned velvety sof
"tness, which so "
mingled with her
 lack of art in 
singing that it
 seemed as if no
thing in that vo
ice could be alt
ered without spo
iling it.  �
�What is this?�
� thought Nichol
"as, listening to"
 her with widely
 opened eyes. �
��What has happe
ned to her? How 
she is singing t
oday!” And su
ddenly the whole
 world centered 
for him on antic
ipation of the 
"next note, the n"
"ext phrase, and "
everything in th
e world was divi
ded into three 
beats: “Oh mio
 crudele affetto
".”... One, two"
", three... one,"
"
two, three... O"
ne... “Oh mio 
crudele affetto.
"”... One, two,"
 three... One. 
"“Oh, this sens"
eless life of ou
rs!” thought N
icholas. “All 
"
this misery, an"
"d money, and Dó"
"lokhov, and ange"
"r, and honor—i"
t’s all nonse
nse... but this 
is real.... Now 
"then, Natásha, "
"now then, deares"
"t!
Now then, da"
rling! How will 
she take that si
? She’s taken 
it! Thank God!�
�� And without n
oticing that he 
"was singing, to "
strengthen the s
i he sung a sec
"ond, a third bel"
ow the high note
". “Ah, God! Ho"
w fine! Did I r
eally take it? H
ow fortunate!”
 he thought.  
"Oh, how that cho"
"rd vibrated, and"
 how moved was s
omething that wa
s finest in Ros
tóv’s soul! A
nd this somethin
g was apart from
 everything else
 in the world a
nd above everyth
ing in the world
. “What were l
"osses, and
Dól"
"okhov, and words"
 of honor?... Al
l nonsense! One 
might kill and r
ob and yet be h
appy....”   
    CHAPTER X
VI  It was lon
g since Rostóv 
had felt such en
joyment from mus
ic as he did th
at day. But no s
ooner had Natás
ha finished her 
barcarolle than 
 reality again p
resented itself.
 He got up witho
ut saying a word
 and went downs
tairs to his own
 room. A quarter
 of an hour late
r the old count 
 came in from hi
"s club, cheerful"
 and contented. 
"Nicholas, hearin"
"g him
drive up,"
 went to meet hi
m.  “Well—
had a good time?
” said the old
" count, smiling "
gaily and proud
ly at his son. 
 Nicholas tried
" to say “Yes,�"
�� but could not
: and he nearly 
burst into sobs
. The count was 
lighting his pip
e and did not no
tice his son’s
 condition.  
"“Ah, it can’"
t be avoided!”
 thought Nichola
"s, for the first"
 and last time.
" And suddenly, i"
n the most casua
"l tone, which ma"
de him feel ash
"amed of himself,"
" he said, as if "
merely asking hi
s father to let 
him have the ca
rriage to drive 
to town:  “P
"apa, I have come"
 on a matter of 
business. I was 
nearly forgettin
g. I need some 
money.”  “
Dear me!” said
" his father, who"
 was in a specia
lly good humor. 
“I told you i
t would not be e
nough. How much?
”  “Very m
"uch,” said Nic"
"holas flushing, "
and with a stupi
d careless smil
"e, for which he "
was long unable 
to forgive himse
"lf, “I have lo"
"st a
little, I "
mean a good deal
", a great deal�"
�forty three tho
usand.”  “
What! To whom?..
. Nonsense!” c
"ried the count, "
suddenly reddeni
ng with an apop
lectic flush ove
r neck and nape 
as old people do
.  “I promis
ed to pay tomorr
"ow,” said Nich"
olas.  “Well
!...” said the
" old count, spre"
ading out his ar
ms and sinking 
helplessly on th
e sofa.  “It
 can’t be help
ed! It happens t
o everyone!” s
"aid the son, wit"
"h
a bold, free,"
" and easy tone, "
while in his sou
l he regarded hi
mself as a wort
hless scoundrel 
whose whole life
 could not atone
 for his crime. 
He longed to ki
ss his father’
s hands and knee
l to beg his for
"giveness,
but s"
"aid, in a carele"
ss and even rude
" voice, that it "
happens to ever
yone!  The old
 count cast down
 his eyes on hea
ring his son’s
 words and began
 bustlingly sea
rching for somet
"hing.

“Yes,"
" yes,” he mutt"
"ered, “it will"
" be difficult, I"
" fear, difficult"
 to raise... ha
ppens to everybo
"dy! Yes, who has"
 not done it?”
  And with a f
urtive glance at
 his son’s fac
"e, the count wen"
t out of the ro
om.... Nicholas 
had been prepare
d for resistance
", but had not at"
 all expected t
his.  “Papa!
 Pa-pa!” he ca
"lled after him, "
"sobbing, “forg"
ive me!” And 
seizing his fath
"er’s hand, he "
pressed it to hi
s lips and burst
 into tears.  
 While father an
d son were havin
g their explanat
"ion, the mother "
and daughter we
re having one no
t less important
. Natásha came 
running to her 
"mother, quite ex"
cited.  “Mam
ma!... Mamma!...
 He has made me.
..”  “Made
 what?”  “
"Made, made me an"
" offer, Mamma! M"
amma!” she exc
laimed.  The c
ountess did not 
believe her ears
. Denísov had p
roposed. To whom
? To this chit 
"of a girl, Natá"
"sha, who not so "
long ago was pla
ying with dolls
 and who was sti
ll having lesson
s.  “Don’t
", Natásha! What"
 nonsense!” sh
"e said, hoping i"
t was a joke.  
"
“Nonsense, in"
deed! I am telli
"ng you the fact,"
” said Natásh
a indignantly. 
“I come to ask
" you what to do,"
 and you call it
 ‘nonsense!�
�”  The coun
tess shrugged he
r shoulders.  
“If it is true
 that Monsieur D
enísov has made
" you a proposal,"
 tell him he is
" a fool, that’"
s all!”  “
"No, he’s not a"
 fool!” replie
d Natásha indig
nantly and serio
usly.  “Well
" then, what do y"
ou want? You’r
e all in love no
"wadays. Well,
i"
f you are in lov
"e, marry him!”"
 said the counte
"ss, with a laugh"
 of annoyance. 
“Good luck to 
you!”  “No
", Mamma, I’m n"
ot in love with 
"him, I suppose I"
’m not in love
 with him.” 
"
“Well then, "
tell him so.” 
"

“Mamma, are"
 you cross? Don�
"��t be cross, de"
ar! Is it my fau
"lt?”

“No,"
" but what is it,"
 my dear? Do you
 want me to go a
nd tell him?” 
 said the counte
ss smiling.  �
"��No, I will do "
"it myself, only "
tell me what to 
say. It’s all 
very well for y
"ou,” said Nat�"
"�sha, with a res"
ponsive smile. �
��You should ha
ve seen how he s
aid it! I know h
e did not mean t
"o say it, but it"
 came out accid
ently.”  “
"Well, all the sa"
"me, you must ref"
use him.”  �
"��No, I mustn’"
t. I am so sorry
 for him! He’s
 so nice.”  
"“Well then, ac"
cept his offer. 
It’s high time
 for you to be 
"married,” answ"
ered the countes
s sharply and sa
rcastically.  
"“No, Mamma, bu"
t I’m so sorry
 for him. I don�
��t know how I�
�m to say it.�
�  “And ther
e’s nothing fo
r you to say. I 
shall speak to h
"im myself,”
s"
aid the countess
", indignant that"
 they should hav
e dared to treat
 this little Na
tásha as grown 
"up.

“No, no"
t on any account
! I will tell hi
"m myself, and yo"
u’ll listen a
"t the door,” a"
nd Natásha ran 
across the drawi
ng room to the d
"ancing
hall, wh"
ere Denísov was
 sitting on the 
same chair by th
e clavichord wi
th his face in h
is hands.  He 
jumped up at the
 sound of her li
ght step.  “
"Nataly,” he sa"
"id, moving with "
rapid steps towa
"rd her, “decid"
e my fate. It i
s in your hands.
”  “Vasíl
"i Dmítrich, I�"
�m so sorry for 
"you!... No, but "
you are so nice
... but it won�
�t do...not that
... but as a fri
"end, I shall alw"
ays love you.�
�  Denísov be
nt over her hand
 and she heard s
trange sounds sh
e did not under
stand. She kisse
d his rough curl
y black head. At
" this instant, t"
hey heard the q
uick rustle of t
he countess’ d
ress. She came u
p to them.  �
�Vasíli Dmítri
"ch, I thank you "
"for the honor,�"
"� she said, with"
 an embarrassed
" voice, though i"
t sounded severe
 to Denísov—�
��but my daught
"er is so young, "
and I thought th
"at, as my son’"
"s friend, you
w"
ould have addres
sed yourself fir
st to me. In tha
t case you would
 not have oblig
ed me to give th
is refusal.” 
 “Countess...
” said Deníso
"v, with downcast"
 eyes and a guil
ty face. He tri
"ed to say more, "
but faltered.  
 Natásha could 
"not remain calm,"
 seeing him in s
uch a plight. Sh
e began to sob 
aloud.  “Cou
"ntess, I have do"
"ne w’ong,” D"
enísov went on 
in an unsteady 
"voice, “but be"
"lieve me, I so a"
dore your daught
er and all your 
family that I w
ould give my lif

�� He looked at 
"the countess,
a"
nd seeing her se
vere face said: 
"“Well, good-by"
", Countess,” a"
nd kissing her 
"hand, he left th"
e room with quic
k resolute strid
"es, without
loo"
king at Natásha
.   Next day 
Rostóv saw Den�
�sov off. He did
 not wish to sta
y another day i
n Moscow. All De
nísov’s Mosco
w friends gave h
im a farewell e
ntertainment at 
"the gypsies’, "
with the result 
that he had no 
recollection of 
how he was put i
n the sleigh or 
of the first thr
ee stages of hi
s journey.  Af
ter Denísov’s
" departure, Rost"
óv spent anothe
r fortnight in M
"oscow,
without "
going out of the
" house, waiting "
for the money hi
s father could 
not at once rais
"e, and he spent "
most of his time
 in the girls’
 room.  Sónya
 was more tender
 and devoted to 
him than ever. I
t was as if she 
 wanted to show 
him that his los
ses were an achi
evement that mad
e her love him

  CHAPTER I  
 After his inter
view with his wi
fe Pierre left f
or Petersburg. A
t the Torzhók 
"post station, ei"
ther there were 
no horses or the
 postmaster wou
ld not supply th
em. Pierre was o
bliged to wait. 
Without undressi
"ng,
he lay down"
 on the leather 
sofa in front of
" a round table, "
put his big fee
t in their overb
oots on the tabl
"e, and began to "
reflect.  “W
ill you have the
 portmanteaus br
ought in? And a 
"bed got ready, a"
nd tea?” aske
d his valet.  
Pierre gave no a
"nswer, for he ne"
ither heard nor 
saw anything. He
 had begun to t
hink of the last
 station and was
 still pondering
 on the same qu
estion—one so 
important that h
e took no notice
 of what went o
n around him. No
t only was he in
different as to 
whether he got t
o Petersburg ea
"rlier or later, "
or whether he se
cured accommodat
ion at this sta
"tion, but compar"
ed to the though
ts that now occu
pied him it was 
a matter of ind
ifference whethe
r he remained th
ere for a few ho
urs or for the 
rest of his life
.  The postmas
"ter, his wife, t"
"he valet, and a "
peasant woman se
lling Torzhók 
embroidery came 
into the room of
fering their ser
vices. Without 
changing his car
"eless attitude, "
Pierre looked at
 them over his 
spectacles unabl
e to understand 
what they wanted
 or how they cou
ld go on living
 without having 
solved the probl
ems that so abso
rbed him. He had
 been engrossed
 by the same tho
ughts ever since
 the day he retu
rned from Sokó
lniki after the 
duel and had spe
nt that first ag
"onizing, sleeple"
ss night. But n
"ow, in the solit"
ude of the journ
"ey, they seized "
him with specia
l force. No matt
er what he thoug
"ht about, he alw"
ays returned to 
 these same ques
tions which he c
ould not solve a
nd yet could not
 cease to ask h
imself. It was a
s if the thread 
of the chief scr
ew which held hi
s life together
" were stripped, "
so that the scre
w could not get 
"in or out,
but "
went on turning 
uselessly in the
 same place.  
The postmaster c
ame in and began
 obsequiously to
 beg his excelle
ncy to wait onl
"y two hours, whe"
"n, come what mig"
"ht, he would let"
 his excellency 
 have the courie
r horses. It was
 plain that he w
as lying and onl
y wanted to get
 more money from
 the traveler. 
 “Is this goo
d or bad?” Pie
rre asked himsel
f. “It is good
" for me,
bad fo"
r another travel
"er, and for hims"
elf it’s unavo
"idable, because"
 he needs money 
for food; the ma
n said an office
r had once given
 him a thrashin
g for letting a 
private traveler
 have the courie
r horses. But t
he officer thras
hed him because 
he had to get on
 as quickly as 
"possible. And I,"
” continued Pi
"erre, “shot D�"
�lokhov because 
I considered my
"self injured, an"
d Louis XVI was 
executed because
 they considere
d him a criminal
", and a year lat"
er they executed
 those who exec
uted him—also 
for some reason.
 What is bad? Wh
at is good? What
 should one lov
e and what hate?
 What does one l
ive for? And wha
t am I? What is
" life, and what "
is death? What p
ower governs all
?”  There wa
s no answer to a
ny of these ques
"tions, except on"
"e, and that
not"
 a logical answe
r and not at all
 a reply to them
. The answer was
: “You’ll d
ie and all will 
end. You’ll di
"e and know all, "
or cease asking
.” But dying w
as also dreadful
.  The Torzhó
"k peddler woman,"
 in a whining vo
"ice, went on off"
ering her wares
", especially a p"
air of goatskin 
slippers. “I h
ave hundreds of 
 rubles I don’
t know what to d
"o with, and she "
stands in her ta
ttered cloak lo
oking timidly at
" me,” he thoug"
ht. “And what 
does she want t
he money for? As
 if that money c
ould add a hair�
��s breadth to 
happiness or pea
ce of mind. Can 
anything in the 
world make her o
r me less a pre
y to evil and de
ath?—death whi
ch ends all and 
must come today
 or tomorrow—a
"t any rate, in a"
n instant as com
pared with eter
nity.” And aga
in he twisted th
e screw with the
 stripped thread
",
and again it "
turned uselessly
 in the same pla
ce.  His serva
nt handed him a 
"half-cut novel, "
in the form of l
"etters, by
Mada"
me de Souza. He 
began reading ab
out the sufferin
gs and virtuous 
 struggles of a 
certain Emilie d
e Mansfeld. “A
nd why did she r
esist her seduc
er when she love
d him?” he tho
ught. “God cou
ld not have put 
 into her heart 
an impulse that 
was against His 
will. My wife—
as she once was
—did not strug
"gle, and perhaps"
 she was right. 
Nothing has been
"
found out, not"
"hing discovered,"
” Pierre again
 said to himself
. “All we can
 know is that we
 know nothing. A
nd that’s the 
height of human 
 wisdom.”  E
verything within
 and around him 
"seemed confused,"
" senseless, and"
 repellent. Yet 
in this very rep
ugnance to all h
is circumstances
 Pierre found a
 kind of tantali
zing satisfactio
n.  “I make 
bold to ask your
 excellency to m
ove a little for
 this gentleman
",” said the po"
"stmaster, enteri"
ng the room foll
owed by another 
"
traveler, also "
detained for lac
k of horses.  
The newcomer was
" a short, large-"
"boned, yellow-fa"
"ced, wrinkled ol"
"d
man, with gra"
y bushy eyebrows
 overhanging bri
ght eyes of an i
ndefinite grayi
sh color.  Pie
rre took his fee
"t off the table,"
" stood up, and l"
ay down on a bed
 that had been 
got ready for hi
"m, glancing now "
and then at the 
"newcomer, who,
"
with a gloomy an
"d tired face, wa"
s wearily taking
 off his wraps w
ith the aid of 
"his servant, and"
 not looking at 
Pierre. With a p
air of felt boot
s on his thin b
"ony legs, and ke"
"eping on a worn,"
 nankeen-covered
", sheepskin
coa"
"t, the traveler "
sat down on the 
"sofa, leaned bac"
k his big head w
ith its broad t
emples and close
"-cropped hair, a"
nd looked at Bez
úkhov. The ste
"rn, shrewd, and "
penetrating expr
ession of that l
ook struck Pierr
e. He felt a wi
sh to speak to t
"he stranger, but"
 by the time he 
had made up his 
 mind to ask him
 a question abou
"t the roads, the"
 traveler had cl
osed his eyes. 
His shriveled ol
d hands were fol
ded and on the f
inger of one of 
 them Pierre not
iced a large cas
t iron ring with
 a seal represen
ting a death’
s head. The stra
nger sat without
" stirring, eithe"
"r resting or, as"
 it seemed to P
"ierre, sunk in p"
rofound and calm
 meditation. His
 servant was al
"so a yellow, wri"
"nkled old man, w"
ithout beard or 
"mustache,
evide"
ntly not because
 he was shaven b
ut because they 
had never grown.
 This active ol
d servant was un
packing the trav
eler’s canteen
 and preparing 
tea. He brought 
in a boiling sam
ovar. When every
thing was ready
", the stranger o"
"pened his eyes, "
moved to the tab
"le, filled a
tu"
mbler with tea f
or himself and o
ne for the beard
less old man to 
whom he passed 
it. Pierre began
 to feel a sense
" of uneasiness, "
"and the
need, e"
ven the inevitab
"ility, of enteri"
ng into conversa
tion with this 
stranger.  The
 servant brought
 back his tumble
r turned upside 
"down, * with an"
 unfinished bit 
of nibbled sugar
", and asked if a"
nything more wou
ld be wanted. 
     * To indic
ate he did not w
ant more tea.  
 “No. Give me 
"the book,” sai"
d the stranger. 
  The servant h
anded him a book
 which Pierre to
ok to be a devot
"ional work,
and"
 the traveler be
came absorbed in
 it. Pierre look
ed at him. All a
t once the stra
nger closed the 
"book, putting in"
" a marker, and a"
"gain,
leaning w"
ith his arms on 
the back of the 
"sofa, sat in his"
 former positio
n with his eyes 
shut. Pierre loo
ked at him and h
ad not time to 
turn away when t
"he old man, open"
"ing his eyes, fi"
xed his steady a
nd severe gaze 
straight on Pier
re’s face.  
Pierre felt conf
used and wished 
to avoid that lo
"ok, but the brig"
ht old eyes att
racted him irres
istibly.    
  CHAPTER II 
 “I have the 
pleasure of addr
essing Count Bez
"úkhov, if I am "
"not
mistaken,�"
� said the stran
ger in a deliber
ate and loud voi
ce.  Pierre lo
oked silently an
d inquiringly at
 him over his sp
ectacles.  “
I have heard of 
"you, my dear sir"
",” continued t"
"he stranger, “"
and of your mis
fortune.” He s
eemed to emphasi
ze the last word
", as if to
say�"
"��“Yes, misfor"
tune! Call it wh
"at you please, I"
 know that what 
 happened to you
 in Moscow was a
 misfortune.”�
��“I regret it
" very
much, my "
dear sir.”  
Pierre flushed a
"nd, hurriedly pu"
tting his legs d
own from the bed
", bent
forward "
toward the old m
an with a forced
 and timid smile
.  “I have n
ot referred to t
his out of curio
"sity, my dear si"
"r, but for
grea"
ter reasons.” 
"

He paused, hi"
s gaze still on 
"Pierre, and move"
d aside on the s
ofa by way of i
nviting the othe
r to take a seat
 beside him. Pie
rre felt relucta
nt to enter int
o conversation w
ith this old man
", but, submittin"
g to him involu
"ntarily, came up"
 and sat down be
side him.  “
"You are unhappy,"
" my dear sir,”"
 the stranger co
ntinued. “You 
 are young and I
 am old. I shoul
d like to help y
ou as far as lie
s in my power.�
"��

“Oh, yes"
!” said Pierre
", with a forced "
smile. “I am v
ery grateful to
 you. Where are 
you traveling fr
om?”  The st
ranger’s face 
"was not genial, "
it was even cold
" and severe, but"
 in spite of th
"is, both the fac"
e and words of h
is new acquainta
nce were irresi
stibly attractiv
e to Pierre.  
“But if for an
y reason you don
’t feel inclin
ed to talk to me
",”
said the o"
"ld man, “say s"
"o, my dear sir.�"
�� And he sudden
"ly smiled, in
a"
n unexpected and
 tenderly patern
al way.  “Oh
" no, not at all!"
 On the contrary
", I am very glad"
 to make your a
"cquaintance,” "
said Pierre. And
" again, glancing"
 at the stranger
"’s
hands, he "
looked more clos
"ely at the ring,"
 with its skull�
��a Masonic sig
n.  “Allow m
"e to ask,” he "
"said, “are you"
 a Mason?”  
"“Yes, I belong"
 to the Brotherh
ood of the Freem
"asons,” said t"
"he
stranger, lo"
oking deeper and
 deeper into Pie
rre’s eyes. �
�And in their n
ame and my own I
 hold out a brot
herly hand to yo
u.”  “I am
" afraid,” said"
" Pierre, smiling"
", and wavering b"
etween the conf
idence the perso
nality of the Fr
eemason inspired
 in him and his 
own habit of ri
diculing the Mas
onic beliefs—�
��I am afraid I 
am very far fro
m understanding�
��how am I to pu
t it?—I am afr
aid my way of lo
oking at the wo
rld is so oppose
d to yours that 
we shall not und
erstand one ano
ther.”  “I
 know your outlo
"ok,” said the "
"Mason, “and th"
e view of life y
"ou
mention, and"
 which you think
 is the result o
f your own menta
"l efforts,
is t"
he one held by t
he majority of p

e invariable fru
"it
of pride, in"
"dolence, and ign"
orance. Forgive 
"me, my dear sir,"
 but if I had n
ot known it I sh
ould not have ad
dressed you. You
r view of life i
s a regrettable
 delusion.”  
 “Just as I ma
y suppose you to
" be deluded,” "
"said Pierre, wit"
h a faint smile
.  “I should
 never dare to s
ay that I know t
"he truth,” sai"
"d the Mason,
wh"
ose words struck
 Pierre more and
 more by their p
recision and fir
mness. “No on
e can attain to 
truth by himself
. Only by laying
 stone on stone 
 with the cooper
"ation of all, by"
 the millions of
 generations fro
m our forefathe
r Adam to our ow
"n times, is that"
 temple reared w
hich is to be a

"dded, and closed"
 his eyes.  �
��I ought to tel
l you that I do 
not believe... d
o not believe in
"
God,” said P"
"ierre, regretful"
ly and with an e
"ffort, feeling i"
t essential to 
speak the whole 
truth.  The Ma
son looked inten
tly at Pierre an
d smiled as a ri
ch man with mil
lions in hand mi
ght smile at a p
oor fellow who t
"old him that he,"
" poor
man, had "
not the five rub
les that would m
ake him happy. 
"
“Yes, you do"
" not know Him, m"
"y dear sir,” s"
aid the Mason. �
��You cannot kn
ow Him. You do n
ot know Him and 
that is why you 
are unhappy.” 
"

“Yes, yes, "
"I am unhappy,”"
 assented Pierre
. “But what am
 I to do?”  
 “You know Him
" not, my dear si"
"r, and so you ar"
e very unhappy. 
You do not know
" Him, but He is "
"here, He is in m"
"e, He is in my w"
"ords, He is in
"
"thee, and even i"
n those blasphem
ous words thou h
ast just uttered
!” pronounced
 the Mason in a 
stern and tremul
ous voice.  He
 paused and sigh
"ed, evidently tr"
ying to calm him
self.  “If H
"e were not,” h"
"e said quietly, "
“you and I wou
ld not be speak
"ing of Him, my d"
ear sir. Of what
", of whom, are w"
e speaking? Whom
 hast thou deni
ed?” he sudden
ly asked with ex
ulting austerity
 and authority 
in his voice. �
�Who invented Hi
"m, if He did not"
 exist? Whence 
came thy concept
ion of the exist
ence of such an 
incomprehensible
 Being? didst t
"hou, and why did"
 the whole world
", conceive the i"
dea of the exis
tence of such an
 incomprehensibl
"e Being, a Being"
" all-powerful,
"
"eternal, and inf"
inite in all His
 attributes?...�
��  He stopped
 and remained si
lent for a long 
time.  Pierre 
could not and di
d not wish to br
eak this silence
.  “He exist
"s, but to unders"
tand Him is hard
",” the Mason b"
"egan again,
loo"
king not at Pier
re but straight 
"before him, and "
turning the leav
es of his book 
with his old han
ds which from ex
citement he coul
d not keep stil
l. “If it were
 a man whose exi
stence thou dids
t doubt I could 
 bring him to th

"n I, an insignif"
"icant mortal, sh"
ow His omnipoten

sed again. “Wh
o art thou? Thou
 dreamest that 
thou art wise be

lasphemous words
",” he
went on"
", with a somber "
and scornful smi

"For ages, from o"

..”  Pierre 
listened with sw
"elling heart, ga"
zing into the Ma
son’s face wit
"h
shining eyes,"
 not interruptin
g or questioning
" him, but believ"
ing with his wh
ole soul what th
e stranger said.
 Whether he acce
pted the wise r

"his vocation, wh"
ich radiated fro

ruck Pierre espe
cially by contra

opelessness)—a
"t any rate, Pier"
re longed with h
is whole soul t
o believe and he
" did believe, an"
d felt a joyful 
sense of comfort
",
regeneration,"
 and return to l
ife.  “He is
 not to be appre
hended by reason
", but by life,�"
� said the Maso
n.  “I do no
"t understand,”"
" said Pierre, fe"
eling with disma
y doubts reawak
ening. He was af
raid of any want
" of clearness, a"
"ny weakness, in"
 the Mason’s a
rguments; he dre
aded not to be a
ble to believe i
n him. “I don
"’t understand,"
"” he said, “"
how it is that t
he mind of man 
cannot attain th
e knowledge of w
hich you speak.�
��  The Mason 
smiled with his 
gentle fatherly 
smile.  “The
 highest wisdom 
and truth are li
ke the purest li
quid we may wish
"
to imbibe,” "
he said. “Can 
I receive that p
ure liquid into 
an impure vesse
l and judge of i
ts purity? Only 
by the inner pur
ification of mys
elf can I retai
n in some degree
 of purity the l
iquid I receive.
"”

“Yes, y"
"es, that is so,�"
�� said Pierre j
oyfully.  “T
he highest wisdo
m is not founded
 on reason alone
", not on those
"
worldly sciences
" of physics, his"
"tory, chemistry,"
" and the like, i"
nto which intel
lectual knowledg
e is divided. Th
e highest wisdom
 is one. The hi
ghest wisdom has
 but one science
—the science o
f the whole—th
e science expla

. To receive th
at science it is
 necessary to pu
rify and renew o
ne’s inner se

"e one can know, "
it is necessary 
to believe and t
o perfect one�
�s self. And to 
"attain this end,"
 we have the lig
ht called consc
ience that God h
as implanted in 
our souls.”  
"
“Yes, yes,”"
 assented Pierre
.  “Look the
n at thy inner s
elf with the eye
"s of the spirit,"
 and ask thysel

 Are you content
 with yourself a

“No, "
"I hate my life,�"
�� Pierre mutter
"ed, wincing.

"
“Thou hatest i
t. Then change i

"ese words, the M"
"ason, as if tire"
d by his long di
"scourse, again
"
leaned his arms 
on the back of t

ed his eyes. Pie
rre looked at t
"hat aged, stern,"
" motionless, alm"
ost lifeless fac
e and moved his
 lips without ut
tering a sound. 
He wished to say
", “Yes, a vile"
",
idle, vicious"
 life!” but da
red not break th
e silence.  Th
e Mason cleared 
his throat huski
"ly, as old men d"

��How about the 
horses?” he as
"ked, without loo"
king at Pierre. 
  “The exchan

wered the servan
t. “Will you

"�

“No, tell"

"t Pierre, rising"
 with downcast 
head; and he beg
an to pace the r

casionally at t

��But this man k

ed to say this t
"o the Mason, but"
 did not dare to
". The
traveler,"
 having packed h
is things with h
is practiced han
"ds, began
faste"
ning his coat. W
hen he had finis
"hed, he turned t"
"o Bezúkhov, and"
 said in a tone
 of indifferent 
politeness:  �
��Where are you 
"going to now, my"
 dear sir?”  
 “I?... I’m 
going to Petersb
"urg,” answered"
" Pierre, in a ch"
"ildlike,
hesita"
ting voice. “I
 thank you. I ag
ree with all you
 have said. But 
 do not suppose 
me to be so bad.
 With my whole s

 what you would
" have me be, but"
 I have never ha

I, above all, "
who am to blame

"Help me, teach m"
"e, and
perhaps "
I may...”  P
ierre could not 
go on. He gulped
 and turned away
.  The Mason r
emained silent f
"or a long time, "
evidently consid
ering.  “Hel

  The traveler
 was Joseph Alex
éevich Bazdéev
", as Pierre saw "
from the postma
ster’s book. B
azdéev had been
 one of the best
-known Freemason
s and Martinist
"s, even in Noví"
kov’s time. Fo
r a long while a
fter he had gon
"e, Pierre did no"
t go to bed or o
rder horses but 
paced up and dow
"n
the room, pon"
dering over his 
"vicious past, an"
d with a rapturo
us sense of beg
inning anew pict
ured to himself 
"the blissful, ir"
"reproachable,
v"
irtuous future t
hat seemed to hi
m so easy. It se
emed to him that
 he had been vi
cious only becau
se he had someho
w forgotten how 
good it is to b
e virtuous. Not 
a trace of his f
ormer doubts rem
ained in his sou
l. He firmly be
lieved in the po
ssibility of the
 brotherhood of 
men united in t
he aim of suppor
ting one another
 in the path of 
"virtue, and that"
 is how Freemas
onry presented i
tself to him.  
     CHAPTER
 III  On reach
ing Petersburg P
ierre did not le
t anyone know of
" his arrival,
h"
e went nowhere a
nd spent whole d
ays in reading T
"homas à Kempis,"
 whose book had
 been sent him b
y someone unknow
n. One thing he 
continually rea
lized as he read
 that book: the 
"joy, hitherto un"
"known to him,
o"
f believing in t
he possibility o
f attaining perf
"ection, and in t"
he possibility 
of active brothe
rly love among m
"en, which Joseph"
 Alexéevich ha
d revealed to hi
m. A week after 
"his arrival, the"
 young Polish co
"unt,
Willarski,"
 whom Pierre had
 known slightly 
in Petersburg so
"ciety, came
int"
o his room one e
vening in the of
ficial and cerem
onious manner in
 which Dólokho
v’s second had
" called on him, "
"and, having clos"
ed the door beh
ind him and sati
sfied himself th
at there was nob
ody else in the 
"
room, addressed"
 Pierre.  “I
 have come to yo
u with a message
" and an offer, C"
"ount,” he
sai"
d without sittin
g down. “A per
son of very high
 standing in our
 Brotherhood ha
s made applicati
on for you to be
 received into o
ur Order before
 the usual term 
and has proposed
 to me to be you
r sponsor. I co
nsider it a sacr
ed duty to fulfi
ll that person�
�s wishes. Do yo
u wish to enter
 the Brotherhood
 of Freemasons u
nder my sponsors
hip?”  The c
"old, austere ton"
"e of this man, w"
hom he had almos
t always before 
"met
at balls, a"
miably smiling i
n the society of
 the most brilli
"ant women,
surp"
rised Pierre.  
"
“Yes, I do wi"
"sh it,” said h"
e.  Willarski 
bowed his head. 
  “One more q
"uestion, Count,�"
"�� he said, “w"
hich I beg you t
o answer in all
 sincerity—not
 as a future Mas
on but as an hon
est man: have yo
u renounced you
r former convict
ions—do you be
lieve in God?”
  Pierre consi
dered.  “Yes
"... yes, I belie"
"ve in God,” he"
 said.  “In 
that case...” 
"began Willarski,"
 but Pierre inte
rrupted him.  
"“Yes, I do bel"
"ieve in God,” "
he repeated.  
“In that case 
"we can go,” sa"
id Willarski. �
�My carriage is 
at your service
.”  Willarsk
i was silent thr
oughout the driv
e. To Pierre’s
 inquiries as t
o what he must d
o and how he sho
"uld answer, Will"
arski only repli
ed that brother
s more worthy th
an he would test
 him and that Pi
erre had only to
 tell the truth
.  Having ente
red the courtyar
d of a large hou
se where the Lod
ge had its head
"quarters, and ha"
ving ascended a 
"dark staircase, "
they entered a s
mall well-lit a
nteroom where th
ey took off thei
r cloaks without
 the aid of a s
ervant. From the
re they passed i
nto another room
. A man in stran
ge attire appea
red at the door.
" Willarski, step"
"ping toward him,"
 said something
 to him in Frenc
h in an underton
e and then went 
up to a small w
ardrobe in which
 Pierre noticed 
garments such as
 he had never se
en before. Havi
ng taken a kerch
ief from the cup
"board, Willarski"
 bound Pierre�
�s eyes with it 
and tied it in a
" knot behind, ca"
tching some hai
rs painfully in 
the knot. Then h
e drew his face 
"down, kissed him"
", and
taking hi"
m by the hand le
d him forward. T
he hairs tied in
 the knot hurt 
Pierre and there
 were lines of p
ain on his face 
and a shamefaced
 smile. His hug
"e figure, with a"
rms hanging down
 and with a puck
"ered, though
sm"
"iling face, move"
d after Willarsk
i with uncertain
", timid steps.
"
 Having led him
 about ten paces
", Willarski stop"
ped.  “Whate
ver happens to y
"ou,” he said, "
“you must bear
 it all manfully
 if you have fi
rmly resolved to
 join our Brothe
rhood.” (Pierr
e nodded affirm
atively.) “Whe
n you hear a kno
"ck at the door, "
you will uncover
"
your eyes,” "
added Willarski.
 “I wish you c
ourage and succe
"ss,”
and, pre"
ssing Pierre’s
" hand, he went o"
ut.  Left alon
"e, Pierre went o"
n smiling in the
 same way. Once 
or twice he shr
ugged his should
ers and raised h
is hand to the k
"erchief, as if
"
wishing to take 
"it off, but let "
it drop again. T
he five minutes 
spent with his 
eyes bandaged se
emed to him an h
our. His arms fe
"lt numb,
his le"
gs almost gave w
"ay, it seemed to"
 him that he was
 tired out. He 
experienced a va
riety of most co
mplex sensations
. He felt afraid
 of what would 
happen to him an
d still more afr
aid of showing h
is fear. He felt
 curious to kno
w what was going
 to happen and w
hat would be rev
ealed to him; b
"ut most of all, "
he felt joyful t
hat the moment h
ad come when he 
 would at last s
tart on that pat
h of regeneratio
n and on the act
ively virtuous 
life of which he
 had been dreami
ng since he met 
Joseph Alexéev
ich. Loud knocks
 were heard at t
he door. Pierre 
took the bandage
 off his eyes a
nd glanced aroun
d him. The room 
was in black dar
"kness,
only a s"
mall lamp was bu
rning inside som
ething white. Pi
erre went nearer
 and saw that t
he lamp stood on
 a black table o
n which lay an o
pen book. The b
ook was the Gosp
"el, and the whit"
e thing with the
 lamp inside was
 a human skull 
with its cavitie
s and teeth. Aft
er reading the f
irst words of t
he Gospel: “In
 the beginning w
as the Word and 
the Word was wit
"h
God,” Pierr"
e went round the
 table and saw a
 large open box 
filled with som
ething. It was a
 coffin with bon
es inside. He wa
s not at all su
rprised by what 
he saw. Hoping t
o enter on an en
tirely new life 
quite unlike th
"e old one, he ex"
pected everythin
"g to be unusual,"
 even more unus
ual than what he
 was seeing. A s
"kull, a coffin, "
the Gospel—it 
 seemed to him t
hat he had expec
ted all this and
 even more. Tryi
ng to stimulate
 his emotions he
 looked around. 
"“God, death, l"
"ove, the
brothe"
"rhood of man,”"
 he kept saying 
"to himself, asso"
ciating these w
ords with vague 
yet joyful ideas
. The door opene
d and someone ca
me in.  By the
" dim light, to w"
hich Pierre had 
already become a
"ccustomed, he
s"
aw a rather shor
t man. Having ev
idently come fro
m the light into
" the
darkness, "
"the man paused, "
then moved with 
cautious steps t
oward the table
 and placed on i
t his small leat
her-gloved hands
.  This short 
man had on a whi
te leather apron
 which covered h
is chest and pa
rt of his legs; 
he had on a kind
 of necklace abo
ve which rose a 
high white ruff
"le, outlining hi"
s rather long fa
ce which was lit
 up from below.
  “For what 
have you come hi
ther?” asked t
"he newcomer, tur"
ning in Pierre�
��s direction at
 a slight rustle
 made by the lat
ter. “Why have
"
you, who do no"
t believe in the
 truth of the li
ght and who have
 not seen the l
"ight, come here?"
 What do you see
k from us? Wisdo
"m, virtue,
enli"
ghtenment?”  
 At the moment t
he door opened a
nd the stranger 
"came in, Pierre "
felt a sense of
 awe and venerat
ion such as he h
ad experienced i
n his boyhood at
 confession; he
 felt himself in
 the presence of
 one socially a 
complete strang
"er, yet nearer t"
o him through th
e brotherhood of
 man. With bated
 breath and bea
ting heart he mo
ved toward the R
hetor (by which 
name the brothe
r who prepared a
 seeker for entr
ance into the Br
otherhood was k
nown). Drawing n
"earer, he recogn"
ized in the Rhet
or a man he knew
",
Smolyanínov,"
 and it mortifie
d him to think t
hat the newcomer
 was an acquain
tance—he wishe
d him simply a b
rother and a vir
tuous instructor
. For a long ti
me he could not 
"utter a word, so"
 that the Rhetor
 had to repeat 
his question.  
 “Yes... I... 
I... desire rege
"neration,” Pie"
rre uttered with
 difficulty.  
"
“Very well,�"
� said Smolyaní
"nov, and went on"
 at once: “Hav
e you any idea 
of the means by 
which our holy O
rder will help y
ou to reach your
 aim?” said h
e quietly and qu
ickly.  “I..
. hope... for gu
idance... help..
. in regeneratio
"n,” said Pierr"
"e,
with a tremb"
ling voice and s
ome difficulty i
n utterance due 
to his exciteme
nt and to being 
unaccustomed to 
speak of abstrac
t matters in Ru
ssian.  “Wha
t is your concep
tion of Freemaso
nry?”  “I 
imagine that Fre
emasonry is the 
fraternity and e
quality of men w
ho have virtuou
"s aims,” said "
"Pierre, feeling "
ashamed of the i
nadequacy of hi
s words for the 
solemnity of the
" moment, as he s"
poke. “I imag
ine...”  “
Good!” said th
e Rhetor quickly
", apparently sat"
isfied with thi
s answer. “Hav
e you sought for
 means of attain
ing your aim in 
 religion?”  
"
“No, I consid"
ered it erroneou
s and did not fo
"llow it,” said"
" Pierre,
so sof"
tly that the Rhe
tor did not hear
 him and asked h
im what he was 
saying. “I hav
e been an atheis
"t,” answered P"
ierre.  “You
 are seeking for
 truth in order 
to follow its la
"ws in your life,"
 therefore you 
seek wisdom and 
virtue. Is that 
not so?” said 
"the
Rhetor, aft"
er a moment’s 
pause.  “Yes
", yes,” assent"
ed Pierre.  Th
e Rhetor cleared
" his throat, cro"
ssed his gloved 
hands on his bre
"ast,
and began "
to speak.  “
Now I must discl
ose to you the c
hief aim of our 
"Order,” he sai"
"d,
“and if th"
is aim coincides
" with yours, you"
 may enter our B
rotherhood with
 profit. The fir
st and chief obj
ect of our Order
", the foundation"
 on which it re
sts and which no
 human power can
" destroy, is the"
 preservation a
nd handing on to
 posterity of a 
certain importan
t mystery... whi
ch has come dow
n to us from the
" remotest ages, "
even from the fi
rst man—a mys
tery on which pe
rhaps the fate o
f mankind depend
s. But since thi
s mystery is of
 such a nature t
hat nobody can k
now or use it un
less he be prep
ared by long and
 diligent self-p
"urification, not"
 everyone can ho
pe to attain it
 quickly. Hence 
we have a second
"ary aim, that of"
 preparing our 
members as much 
as possible to r
eform their hear
"ts, to purify an"
d enlighten the
"ir minds, by mea"
ns handed on to 
us by tradition 
from those who 
have striven to 
attain this myst
"ery, and thereby"
 to render them 
 capable of rece
iving it.  “
By purifying and
 regenerating ou
r members we try
", thirdly, to im"
prove the whole
" human race, off"
ering it in our 
members an examp
le of piety and
" virtue, and the"
reby try with al
l our might to c
ombat the evil w
hich sways the 
world. Think thi
s over and I wil
l come to you ag
ain.”  “To
 combat the evil
 which sways the
 world...” Pie
"rre repeated, an"
d a mental imag
e of his future 
activity in this
 direction rose 
in his mind. He
 imagined men su
ch as he had him
self been a fort
"night ago, and h"
e addressed an 
edifying exhorta
tion to them. He
 imagined to him
self vicious an
d unfortunate pe
ople whom he wou
ld assist by wor
"d and deed,
ima"
gined oppressors
 whose victims h
e would rescue. 
Of the three ob
jects mentioned 
"by the Rhetor, t"
"his last, that o"
f improving mank
"ind,
especially"
 appealed to Pie
rre. The importa
nt mystery menti
oned by the Rhe
"tor, though it a"
roused his curio
"sity, did not se"
em to him essent
"ial,
and the se"
"cond aim, that o"
f purifying and 
regenerating him
"self, did not
m"
uch interest him
 because at that
 moment he felt 
with delight tha
t he was alread
y perfectly cure
d of his former 
faults and was r
eady for all th
at was good.  
Half an hour lat
"er, the Rhetor r"
eturned to infor
m the seeker of 
the seven virtu
"es, correspondin"
g to the seven s
teps of Solomon�
"��s temple,
whi"
ch every Freemas
on should cultiv
ate in himself. 
These virtues we
re: 1. Discreti
"on, the keeping "
of the secrets o
f the Order. 2. 
Obedience to th
ose of higher ra
nks in the Order
. 3. Morality. 4
. Love of mankin
d. 5. Courage. 
6. Generosity. 7
. The love of de
ath.  “In th
"e seventh place,"
" try, by the fre"
quent thought of
" death,” the
"
"Rhetor said, “"
to bring yoursel
f to regard it n
ot as a dreaded 
"foe, but
as a f"
riend that frees
 the soul grown 
weary in the lab
ors of virtue f
rom this distres
"sful life, and l"
eads it to its p
lace of recompen
se and peace.�
"�

“Yes, tha"
"t must be so,”"
" thought Pierre,"
 when after thes
e words the Rhe
"tor went away, l"
eaving him to so
litary meditatio
n. “It must be
" so,
but I am s"
till so weak tha
t I love my life
", the meaning of"
 which is only 
now gradually op
ening before me.
” But five of 
the other virtue
s which Pierre 
"recalled, counti"
ng them on his f
"ingers, he felt "
already in his 
"soul: courage, g"
"enerosity, moral"
"ity, love of man"
"kind, and especi"
ally obedience�
��which did not 
even seem to him
" a virtue, but a"
 joy. (He now f
elt so glad to b
e free from his 
own lawlessness 
and to submit hi
s will to those
 who knew the in
dubitable truth.
) He forgot what
 the seventh vi
rtue was and cou
ld not recall it
.  The third t
ime the Rhetor c
ame back more qu
ickly and asked 
Pierre whether 
he was still fir
m in his intenti
on and determine
d to submit to 
all that would b
e required of hi
m.  “I am re
ady for everythi
"ng,” said Pier"
re.  “I must
 also inform you
",” said the Rh"
"etor, “that ou"
r Order deliver
s its teaching n
ot in words only
 but also by oth
"er means, which"
 may perhaps hav
e a stronger eff
ect on the since
re seeker after 
wisdom and virt
ue than mere wor
ds. This chamber
 with what you s
ee therein shou
ld already have 
suggested to you
"r heart, if it i"
"s sincere, more "
than words coul
d do. You will p
erhaps also see 
in your further 
initiation a li
ke method of enl
ightenment. Our 
Order imitates t
he ancient socie
ties that expla
ined their teach
ing by hieroglyp
hics. A hierogly
"ph,” said
the"
" Rhetor, “is a"
n emblem of some
thing not cogniz
able by the sens
es but which po
ssesses qualitie
s resembling tho
se of the symbol
.”  Pierre k
new very well wh
at a hieroglyph 
"was, but dared n"
ot speak. He li
stened to the Rh
"etor in silence,"
 feeling from al
l he said that h
is ordeal was a
bout to begin. 
 “If you are 
"resolved, I must"
 begin your init
"iation,” said "
the Rhetor comi
ng closer to Pie
rre. “In token
 of generosity I
 ask you to give
 me all your va
luables.”  �
��But I have not
"hing here,” re"
"plied Pierre, su"
pposing that he 
was asked to gi
ve up all he pos
sessed.  “Wh
at you have with
" you: watch, mon"
"ey, rings....”"
  Pierre quick
ly took out his 
"purse and watch,"
 but could not m
anage for some 
time to get the 
wedding ring off
 his fat finger.
 When that had b
"een
done, the R"
hetor said:  �
��In token of ob
"edience, I ask y"
ou to undress.�
�  Pierre took
" off his coat, w"
"aistcoat, and le"
ft boot accordin
g to the Rhetor
’s instruction
s. The Mason dre
w the shirt back
 from Pierre’s
"
left breast, a"
nd stooping down
 pulled up the l
eft leg of his t
rousers to abov
e the knee. Pier
re hurriedly beg
an taking off hi
s right boot als
o and was going
 to tuck up the 
other trouser le
g to save this s
tranger the tro
"uble, but the Ma"
son told him tha
t was not necess
ary and gave him
 a slipper for 
his left foot. W
ith a childlike 
smile of embarra
"ssment,
doubt, "
and self-derisio
"n, which appeare"
d on his face ag
"ainst his will,"
 Pierre stood wi
th his arms hang
ing down and leg
"s apart, before "
his brother Rhe
"tor, and awaited"
 his further com
mands.  “And
" now, in token o"
"f candor, I ask "
you to reveal to
 me your chief 
"passion,” said"
 the latter.  
“My passion! I
 have had so man
"y,” replied Pi"
erre.  “That
 passion which m
ore than all oth
ers caused you t
o waver on the 
"path of virtue,�"
�� said the Maso
n.  Pierre pau
"sed, seeking a r"
eply.  “Wine
? Gluttony? Idle
ness? Laziness? 
Irritability? An
ger? Women?” 
He went over his
 vices in his mi
"nd, not knowing "
to which of them
 to give the pr
e-eminence.  �
"��Women,” he s"
"aid in a low, sc"
arcely audible v
oice.  The Mas
on did not move 
and for a long t
ime said nothing
 after this ans
wer. At last he 
moved up to Pier
"re and, taking t"
he kerchief that
 lay on the tab
"le, again bound "
his eyes.  “
For the last tim
e I say to you�
�turn all your a
ttention upon y
"ourself, put a b"
ridle on your se
"nses, and seek b"
"lessedness, not "
in passion but 
in your own hear
t. The source of
 blessedness is 
not without us 
but within....�
�  Pierre had 
already long bee
n feeling in him
self that refres
hing source of 
blessedness whic
h now flooded hi
s heart with gla
d emotion.   
   CHAPTER IV
  Soon after t
his there came i
nto the dark cha
mber to fetch Pi
"erre, not
the R"
hetor but Pierre
"’s sponsor, Wi"
"llarski, whom he"
 recognized by h
is voice. To fr
esh questions as
 to the firmness
 of his resoluti
on Pierre repli
"ed: “Yes, yes,"
" I agree,” and"
" with a beaming,"
 childlike smile
",
his fat chest"
" uncovered, step"
ping unevenly an
d timidly in one
 slippered and 
"one booted foot,"
" he advanced, wh"
ile Willarski he
ld a sword to hi
s bare chest. H
e was conducted 
from that room a
long passages th
at turned backw
ards and forward
s and was at las
t brought to the
 doors of the L
odge. Willarski 
"coughed, he was "
answered by the 
Masonic knock wi
"th
mallets, the"
 doors opened be
fore them. A bas
s voice (Pierre 
was still blind
folded) question
ed him as to who
" he was, when an"
d where he was 
"born, and so on."
 Then he was aga
in led somewhere
 still blindfold
"ed,
and as they"
 went along he w
as told allegori
es of the toils 
of his pilgrima
"ge, of holy frie"
"ndship, of the E"
ternal Architect
 of the univers
"e, and of the co"
urage with which
 he should endur
e toils and dan
gers. During the
"se wanderings, P"
ierre noticed th
at he was spoken
 of now as the 
"“Seeker,” no"
w as the “Suff
"erer,” and now"
 as the “Post
"ulant,” to the"
 accompaniment o
f various knocki
ngs with mallet
s and swords. As
 he was being le
d up to some obj
ect he noticed a
 hesitation and
 uncertainty amo
ng his conductor
s. He heard thos
e around him di
sputing in whisp
ers and one of t
hem insisting th
at he should be 
 led along a cer
tain carpet. Aft
er that they too
k his right hand
", placed
it on "
"something, and t"
old him to hold 
a pair of compas
ses to his left 
 breast with the
 other hand and 
to repeat after 
someone who read
 aloud an oath 
of fidelity to t
he laws of the O
rder. The candle
s were then ext
inguished and so
me spirit lighte
"d, as Pierre kne"
"w by the smell, "
and he was told
 that he would n
ow see the lesse
r light. The ban
dage was taken 
off his eyes and
", by the faint l"
ight of the burn
"ing spirit,
Pie"
"rre, as in a dre"
"am, saw several "
men standing bef
"ore him, wearing"
 aprons like th
e Rhetor’s and
 holding swords 
in their hands p
ointed at his b
reast. Among the
m stood a man wh
ose white shirt 
was stained with
 blood. On seei
"ng this, Pierre "
moved forward wi
th his breast to
ward the swords
", meaning them t"
o pierce it. But
 the swords were
 drawn back from
 him and he was
 at once blindfo
lded again.  �
��Now thou hast 
seen the lesser 
"light,” uttere"
d a voice. Then 
the candles wer
e relit and he w
as told that he 
would see the fu
ll light; the b
andage was again
 removed and mor
e than ten voice
s said together:
 “Sic transit
 gloria mundi.�
�  Pierre grad
ually began to r
ecover himself a
nd looked about 
at the room and
 at the people i
n it. Round a lo
ng table covered
 with black sat 
some twelve men
 in garments lik
e those he had a
lready seen. Som
e of them Pierr
e had met in Pet
ersburg society.
 In the Presiden
t’s chair sat 
a young man he 
"did not know, wi"
th a peculiar cr
oss hanging from
 his neck. On h
is right sat the
 Italian abbé w
hom Pierre had m
et at Anna Páv
lovna’s two ye
ars before. Ther
e were also pres
ent a very dist
inguished dignit
ary and a Swiss 
who had formerly
 been tutor at t
he Kurágins’
. All maintained
 a solemn silenc
"e, listening to "
the words of th
"e President, who"
 held a mallet i
n his hand. Let 
into the wall wa
s a star-shaped
 light. At one s
ide of the table
 was a small car
pet with variou
s figures worked
" upon it, at the"
 other was somet
hing resembling 
an altar on whi
ch lay a Testame
nt and a skull. 
Round it stood s
even large cand
lesticks like th
ose used in chur
ches. Two of the
 brothers led Pi
erre up to the 
"altar, placed hi"
s feet at right 
"angles, and bade"
" him lie down,
"
saying that he m
ust prostrate hi
mself at the Gat
es of the Temple
.  “He must 
first receive th
"e trowel,” whi"
spered one of th
e brothers.  �
"��Oh, hush, plea"
se!” said anot
"her.

Pierre, "
"perplexed, looke"
d round with his
 shortsighted ey
es without obey
"ing, and suddenl"
y doubts arose i
n his mind. “W
here am I? What 
am I doing? Are
n’t they laugh
ing at me? Shan�
��t I be ashamed
 to remember th
is?” But these
 doubts only las
ted a moment. Pi
erre glanced at 
 the serious fac
es of those arou
"nd, remembered a"
ll he had alread
"y gone
through,"
 and realized th
at he could not 
stop halfway. He
 was aghast at 
his hesitation a
"nd, trying to ar"
ouse his former 
devotional feeli
"ng,
prostrated "
himself before t
he Gates of the 
Temple. And real
"ly, the
feeling"
 of devotion ret
urned to him eve
n more strongly 
than before. Whe
n he had lain t
"here some time, "
he was told to g
"et up, and a whi"
te leather apro
"n, such as the o"
"thers wore, was "
put on him: he w
as given a trowe
l and three pai
"rs of gloves, an"
d then the Grand
 Master addresse
d him. He told 
him that he shou
ld try to do not
hing to stain th
e whiteness of t
"hat
apron, whic"
h symbolized str
ength and purity
; then of the un
explained trowe
"l, he told him t"
o toil with it t
o cleanse his ow
n heart from vic
"e,
and indulgen"
tly to smooth wi
th it the heart 
of his neighbor.
 As to the firs
t pair of gloves
", a man’s, he "
said that Pierre
 could not know 
 their meaning b
ut must keep the
m. The second pa
ir of man’s gl
oves he was to 
wear at the meet
"ings, and finall"
"y of the third, "
a pair of women
"’s gloves, he "
said: “Dear br
"other, these wom"
an’s gloves ar
e intended for 
you too. Give th
em to the woman 
whom you shall h
onor most of al
l. This gift wil
l be a pledge of
 your purity of 
heart to her who
m you select to
 be your worthy 
helpmeet in Maso
nry.” And afte
"r a pause,
he a"
dded: “But bew
"are, dear brothe"
"r, that these gl"
oves do not deck
 hands that are
 unclean.” Whi
le the Grand Mas
ter said these l
ast words it se
emed to Pierre t
hat he grew emba
rrassed. Pierre 
himself grew sti
ll more confuse
"d, blushed like "
a child till tea
rs came to his e
"yes, began
look"
ing about him un
"easily, and an a"
wkward pause fol
lowed.  This s
ilence was broke
n by one of the 
"brethren, who le"
d Pierre up to t
he rug and bega
n reading to him
 from a manuscri
pt book an expla
nation of all t
he figures on it
": the sun, the m"
"oon, a hammer, a"
" plumb line, a
"
"trowel, a rough "
stone and a squa
"red stone, a pil"
"lar, three windo"
"ws, and
so on. "
Then a place was
 assigned to Pie
"rre, he was show"
n the signs of 
"the Lodge, told "
"the password, an"
d at last was pe
rmitted to sit d
own. The Grand 
Master began rea
ding the statute
s. They were ver
"y long, and
Pie"
"rre, from joy, a"
"gitation, and em"
"barrassment, was"
 not in a state 
to understand w
hat was being re
ad. He managed t
o follow only th
e last words of
 the statutes an
d these remained
 in his mind.  
 “In our templ
es we recognize 
no other distinc
"tions,” read t"
he Grand Master
", “but those b"
etween virtue an
d vice. Beware o
f making any di
stinctions which
 may infringe eq
uality. Fly to a
 brother’s aid
 whoever he may
" be, exhort him "
who goeth astray
", raise him that"
" falleth,
never"
 bear malice or 
enmity toward th
y brother. Be ki

"thy
enemy, do n"
ot avenge thysel
f except by doin
g him good. Thus
 fulfilling the
 highest law tho
u shalt regain t
races of the anc
ient dignity whi
ch thou hast lo
st.”  He fin
"ished and, getti"
"ng up, embraced "
and kissed Pierr
"e, who, with tea"
rs of joy in hi
"s eyes, looked r"
"ound him, not kn"
owing how to ans
wer the congrat
ulations and gre
etings from acqu
aintances that m
et him on all s
ides. He acknowl
edged no acquain
tances but saw i
n all these men 
"only
brothers, "
and burned with 
impatience to se
t to work with t
hem.  The Gran
d Master rapped 
with his mallet.
 All the Masons 
sat down in the
"ir places, and o"
ne of them read 
an exhortation o
n the necessity 
of humility.  
 The Grand Maste
r proposed that 
the last duty sh
ould be performe
"d,
and the dist"
inguished dignit
ary who bore the
 title of “Col
lector of Alms�
�� went round to
 all the brother
s. Pierre would 
have liked to s
ubscribe all he 
"had, but fearing"
 that it might l
ook like pride 
subscribed the s
ame amount as th
e others.  The
 meeting was at 
"an end, and on r"
eaching home Pie
rre felt as if h
e had returned 
from a long jour
ney on which he 
had spent dozens
" of years, had
"
become completel
"y changed, and h"
ad quite left be
hind his former 
habits and way 
of life.    
  CHAPTER V  
 The day after h
e had been recei
ved into the Lod
"ge, Pierre was s"
itting at home 
reading a book a
nd trying to fat
hom the signific
ance of the Squa
"re,
one side of"
 which symbolize
"d God, another m"
"oral things, a t"
hird physical t
"hings, and the f"
ourth a combinat
ion of these. No
w and then his 
attention wander
ed from the book
 and the Square 
and he formed in
 imagination a 
new plan of life
. On the previou
s evening at the
" Lodge, he
had "
heard that a rum
or of his duel h
ad reached the E
mperor and that 
it would be wis
er for him to le
ave Petersburg. 
Pierre proposed 
going to his es
tates in the sou
th and there att
ending to the we
lfare of his ser
fs. He was joyf
ully planning th
"is new life, whe"
n Prince Vasíli
 suddenly enter
ed the room.  
“My dear fello
"w, what have you"
 been up to in M
oscow? Why have 
you quarreled w
"ith Hélène, mo"
n cher? You are 
under a delusion
",” said
Princ"
"e Vasíli, as he"
 entered. “I k
now all about it
", and I can tell"
 you positively
 that Hélène i
s as innocent be
fore you as Chri
st was before t
he Jews.”  P
ierre was about 
"to reply, but Pr"
ince Vasíli int
errupted him.  
 “And why didn
’t you simply 
come straight to
 me as to a frie
nd? I know all 
about it and und
"erstand it all,�"
�� he said. “Y
ou behaved as b
ecomes a man who
 values his hono
"r, perhaps too h"
"astily, but we w"
on’t go into 
that. But consid
er the position 
in which you are
 placing her and
 me in the eyes
" of society, and"
 even of the cou
"rt,” he added,"
 lowering his v
oice. “She is 
living in Moscow
 and you are her
"e. Remember,
de"
"ar boy,” and h"
e drew Pierre’
"s arm downwards,"
 “it is simply
 a misunderstan
ding. I expect y
ou feel it so yo
urself. Let us w
rite her a lett
"er at once, and "
she’ll come he
re and all will 
"be explained, or"
"
else, my dear "
"boy, let me tell"
 you it’s quit
e likely you’l
l have to suffe
r for it.”  
Prince Vasíli g
ave Pierre a sig
nificant look. 
 “I know from
 reliable source
s that the Dowag
er Empress is ta
king a keen int
erest in the who
le affair. You k
now she is very 
gracious to Hé
lène.”  Pie
rre tried severa
l times to speak
", but, on one ha"
"nd, Prince Vasí"
li did not let 
"him and, on the "
"other, Pierre hi"
mself feared to 
begin to speak 
in the tone of d
ecided refusal a
nd disagreement 
in which he had 
 firmly resolved
 to answer his f
ather-in-law. Mo
"reover, the word"
s of the Masoni
"c statutes, “b"
e kindly and cou
"rteous,” recur"
red to him. He 
"blinked, went re"
"d, got up and sa"
"t down again, st"
ruggling with hi
mself to do wha
t was for him th
e most difficult
 thing in life�
�to say an unpl
easant thing to 
"a man’s face, "
to say what the 
"other, whoever
"
"he might be, did"
 not expect. He 
was so used to s
ubmitting to Pri
nce Vasíli’s
 tone of careles
s self-assurance
 that he felt he
 would be unabl
e to withstand i
"t now, but he al"
so felt that on 
what he said now
 his future dep
ended—whether 
he would follow 
the same old roa
"d, or that
new "
path so attracti
vely shown him b
"y the Masons, on"
 which he firmly
 believed he wo
uld be reborn to
 a new life.  
"“Now, dear boy"
",” said Prince"
 Vasíli playful
"ly, “say ‘ye"
"s,’
and I’l"
l write to her m
"yself, and we wi"
ll kill the fatt
ed calf.”  B
ut before Prince
 Vasíli had fin
ished his playfu
"l speech, Pierre"
",
without looki"
"ng at him, and w"
ith a kind of fu
ry that made him
 like his fathe
"r, muttered in a"
 whisper:  “
"Prince, I did no"
t ask you here. 
"Go, please go!�"
� And he jumped 
up and opened t
he door for him.
  “Go!” he
" repeated, amaze"
d at himself and
 glad to see the
 look of confus
ion and fear tha
t showed itself 
on Prince Vasíl
i’s face.  �
��What’s the m
atter with you? 
Are you ill?” 
  “Go!” the
 quivering voice
 repeated. And P
rince Vasíli ha
d to go without
 receiving any e
xplanation.  A
" week later, Pie"
"rre, having take"
n leave of his n
"ew friends, the "
"Masons,
and lea"
ving large sums 
of money with th
"em for alms, wen"
t away to his e
states. His new 
brethren gave hi
m letters to the
 Kiev and Odessa
 Masons and pro
mised to write t
o him and guide 
him in his new a
ctivity.    
  CHAPTER VI 
 The duel betwe
en Pierre and D�
�lokhov was hush
"ed up and, in sp"
ite of the Empe
ror’s severity
 regarding duels
" at that time, n"
either the prin
cipals nor their
 seconds suffere
d for it. But th
e story of the d
"uel,
confirmed "
by Pierre’s ru
pture with his w
"ife, was the tal"
k of society. P
ierre who had be
en regarded with
 patronizing con
descension when 
he was an illeg
"itimate son, and"
 petted and exto
lled when he was
 the best match
" in Russia, had "
sunk greatly in 
the esteem of so
ciety after his 
 marriage—when
 the marriageabl
e daughters and 
their mothers ha
d nothing to ho
pe from him—es
pecially as he d
"id not know how,"
 and did not wi
"sh, to court soc"
iety’s favor. 
Now he alone was
 blamed for what
" had
happened, "
he was said to b
e insanely jealo
us and subject l
ike his father 
to fits of blood
thirsty rage. An
d when after Pie
rre’s departu
re Hélène retu
rned to Petersbu
"rg, she was rece"
ived by all her 
 acquaintances n
ot only cordiall
"y, but even with"
 a shade of defe
rence due to he
r misfortune. Wh
en conversation 
turned on her hu
sband Hélène 
assumed a dignif
"ied expression, "
which with chara
cteristic tact s
he had acquired
 though she did 
not understand i
ts significance.
 This expression
 suggested that
 she had resolve
d to endure her 
troubles uncompl
ainingly and th
at her husband w
as a cross laid 
upon her by God.
 Prince Vasíli 
 expressed his o
pinion more open
ly. He shrugged 
his shoulders wh
en Pierre was m
"entioned and, po"
inting to his fo
"rehead, remarked"
:  “A bit to
uched—I always
 said so.”  
“I said from t
"he first,” dec"
lared Anna Pávl
ovna referring t
"o
Pierre, “I "
said at the time
 and before anyo
ne else” (she 
insisted on her
 priority) “th
at that senseles
s young man was 
spoiled by the 
depraved ideas o
f these days. I 
said so even at 
the time when ev
erybody was in 
raptures about h
"im, when he had "
just returned fr
"om abroad, and
"
"when, if you rem"
"ember, he posed "
as a sort of Mar
at at one of my 
soirees. And ho
w has it ended? 
I was against th
is marriage even
 then and foreto
ld all that has
 happened.”  
 Anna Pávlovna 
continued to giv
e on free evenin
gs the same kind
 of soirees as 
before—such as
 she alone had t
he gift of arran
ging—at which
 was to be found
 “the cream of
 really good soc
"iety, the bloom"
 of the intellec
tual essence of 
"Petersburg,” a"
s she herself pu
t it. Besides t
his refined sele
ction of society
 Anna Pávlovna�
��s receptions 
were also distin
guished by the f
act that she alw
ays presented so
me new and inte
resting person t
o the visitors a
nd that nowhere 
else was the st
ate of the polit
ical thermometer
 of legitimate P
etersburg court 
 society so dear
ly and distinctl
y indicated.  
Toward the end o
"f 1806, when all"
 the sad details
 of Napoleon’s
 destruction of
 the Prussian ar
my at Jena and A
uerstädt and th
e surrender of 
most of the Prus
sian fortresses 
had been receive
"d, when our
tro"
ops had already 
entered Prussia 
and our second w
ar with Napoleon
"
was beginning,"
 Anna Pávlovna 
gave one of her 
soirees. The “
cream of really
 good society”
 consisted of th
e fascinating H�
"�lène, forsaken"
 by her husband
", Mortemart, the"
 delightful Prin
ce Hippolyte who
 had just retur
"ned from Vienna,"
 two diplomatist
"s, the old aunt,"
 a young man re
ferred to in tha
t drawing room a
s “a man of gr
eat merit” (un
 homme de beauc
"oup de mérite),"
 a newly appoint
ed maid of honor
" and her mother,"
 and several ot
her less notewor
thy persons.  
The novelty Anna
 Pávlovna was s
etting before he
r guests that ev
ening was Borí
"s Drubetskóy, w"
ho had just arri
ved as a special
 messenger from 
 the Prussian ar
my and was aide-
de-camp to a ver
y important pers
onage.  The te
mperature shown 
by the political
 thermometer to 
the company that
 evening was th
is:  “Whatev
er the European 
sovereigns and c
ommanders may do
 to countenance
" Bonaparte, and "
"to cause me, and"
" us in general, "
annoyance and m
"ortification, ou"

t cease to expr

views on that su

nly say to the 
King of Prussia 
and others: ‘S

"�as

"ge Dandin,’ th"
at’s all we ha
ve to say about 
it!”  When B

o be served up t
"o the guests, en"
tered the drawin
"g
room, almost "
all the company 
"had assembled, a"
nd the conversat
"ion, guided
by "
"Anna Pávlovna, "
was about our di
plomatic relatio
ns with Austria 
and the hope of
 an alliance wit
h her.  Borís
", grown more man"
ly and looking f
"resh, rosy and s"
"elf-possessed,
"
entered the draw
ing room elegant
ly dressed in th
e uniform of an 
 aide-de-camp an
d was duly condu
cted to pay his 
respects to the 
aunt and then b
rought back to t
he general circl
e.  Anna Pávl
ovna gave him he
r shriveled hand
 to kiss and int
roduced him to 
several persons 
whom he did not 
"know, giving him"
 a whispered des
cription of eac
h.  “Prince 
Hippolyte Kurág
in—charming yo
ung fellow; M. 
"Kronq,—chargé"

"es, and the
pec"
uliarities of hi
s reserved natur
"e, Borís had ma"
naged during his
 service to pla
ce himself very 
advantageously. 
He was aide-de-c
amp to a very i
mportant persona
"ge, had been sen"
t on a very impo
rtant mission to
"
Prussia, and h"
ad just returned
 from there as a
 special messeng
er. He had beco
me thoroughly co
nversant with th
at unwritten cod
e with which he 
had been so ple
ased at Olmütz 
and according to
 which an ensign
 might rank inc
omparably higher
" than a general,"
 and according t
o which what was
 needed for suc
cess in the serv
ice was not effo
"rt or work, or c"
"ourage, or
pers"
"everance, but on"
ly the knowledge
 of how to get o
n with those who
 can grant rewa
"rds, and he was "
himself often su
rprised at the r
apidity of his 
success and at t
he inability of 
others to unders
tand these thing
s. In consequen
ce of this disco
very his whole m
"anner of life, a"
ll his relation
s with old frien
"ds, all his plan"
s for his future
", were
complete"
ly altered. He w
"as not rich, but"
 would spend his
 last groat to 
be better dresse
"d than others, a"
nd would rather 
deprive himself 
of many pleasur
es than allow hi
mself to be seen
 in a shabby equ
ipage or appear 
 in the streets 
of Petersburg in
 an old uniform.
 He made friends
 with and sough
t the acquaintan
ce of only those
 above him in po
sition and who 
could therefore 
be of use to him
. He liked Peter
sburg and despis
ed Moscow. The 
remembrance of t
he Rostóvs’ h
ouse and of his 
childish love f
or Natásha was 
unpleasant to hi
m and he had not
 once been to se
e the Rostóvs 
since the day of
 his departure f
or the army. To 
be in Anna Páv
lovna’s drawin
g room he consid
ered an importan
t step up in the
"
service, and h"
e at once unders
"tood his role, l"
etting his hoste
ss make use of 
whatever interes
t he had to offe
r. He himself ca
refully scanned 
"
each face, appr"
aising the possi
bilities of esta
blishing intimac
y with each of 
"those present, a"
nd the advantage
s that might acc
rue. He took th
e seat indicated
 to him beside t
he fair Hélène
 and listened to
 the general co
nversation.  �
��Vienna conside

aty so unattaina
ble that not ev
en a continuity 
of most brillian

"d secure
them, "
and she doubts t
he means we have
 of gaining them
. That is the a
ctual phrase use
d by the Vienna 
"cabinet,” said"
 the Danish char
gé d’affaire
s.  “The dou
bt is flattering
",” said “the"
 man of profound
" intellect,”
"
with a subtle sm
ile.  “We mu
st distinguish b
etween the Vienn
a cabinet and th

ortemart. “The

"uch a thing, it "

“Ah, m"

�� put in Anna P
"ávlovna, “L�"
�Urope” (for 
some reason she 
called it Urope 
as if that were

"Frenchman), “L"
’Urope ne sera

�� *      * �
�Europe will nev

After that Anna 
Pávlovna led up
 to the courage 
and firmness of 
the King of Pru
"ssia, in order t"
o draw Borís in
to the conversat
ion.  Borís l
istened attentiv
ely to each of t
"he speakers, awa"
"iting his turn,"
 but managed mea
nwhile to look r
ound repeatedly 
"at his neighbor,"
 the beautiful 
"Hélène, whose "
eyes several tim
es met those of 
the handsome yo
ung aide-de-camp
 with a smile. 
 Speaking of th
e position of Pr
"ussia, Anna Páv"
lovna very natur
ally asked Bor�
�s to tell them 
about his journe
y to Glogau and 
in what state he
 found the Prus
sian army. Borí
"s, speaking with"
" deliberation, t"
old them in pur
"e, correct Frenc"
h many interesti
ng details about
 the armies and 
"
the court, care"
fully abstaining
 from expressing
 an opinion of h
is own about th
e facts he was r
ecounting. For s
ome time he engr
ossed the gener
"al attention, an"
d Anna Pávlovna
 felt that the n
ovelty she had 
served up was re
ceived with plea
sure by all her 
visitors. The gr
eatest attentio
n of all to Bor�
�s’ narrative 
was shown by Hé
lène. She asked
 him several qu
estions about hi
s journey and se
emed greatly int
erested in the 
state of the Pru
ssian army. As s
oon as he had fi
nished she turne
d to him with h
er usual smile. 
  “You absolu
tely must come a
"nd see me,” sh"
e said in a tone
 that implied t
"hat, for certain"
 considerations 
he could not kno
"w of, this was
"
absolutely neces
sary.  “On T
uesday between e
ight and nine. I
t will give me g
reat pleasure.�
�  Borís prom
ised to fulfill 
her wish and was
 about to begin 
a conversation 
"with her, when A"
nna Pávlovna ca
lled him away on
 the pretext th
at her aunt wish
ed to hear him. 
  “You know h
"er husband, of c"
ourse?” said A
"nna Pávlovna, c"
losing her eyes
 and indicating 
Hélène with a 
sorrowful gestur
"e. “Ah, she is"
 such an unfort
unate and charmi
ng woman! Don’
t mention him be
fore her—plea
se don’t! It i
s too painful fo
r her!”    
   CHAPTER VII
  When Borís 
and Anna Pávlov
na returned to t
he others Prince
 Hippolyte had 
the ear of the c
ompany.  Bendi
ng forward in hi
s armchair he sa
id: “Le Roi de
 Prusse!” and 
 having said thi
s laughed. Every
one turned towar
d him.  “Le 
Roi de Prusse?�
� Hippolyte said
 interrogatively
", again laughing"
",
and then calm"
ly and seriously
 sat back in his
 chair. Anna Pá
vlovna waited f
"or him to go on,"
 but as he seeme
d quite decided 
to say no more 
she began to tel
l of how at Pots
dam the impious 
Bonaparte had st
olen the sword 
of Frederick the
 Great.  “It
 is the sword of
 Frederick the G
reat which I...�
"�� she began, bu"
t Hippolyte int
errupted her wit
h the words: “
Le Roi de Prusse
...” and agai
"n, as soon as al"
l turned toward 
"him, excused him"
self and said no
 more.  Anna 
Pávlovna frowne
"d. Mortemart, Hi"
ppolyte’s frie
"nd, addressed hi"
m firmly.  �
"�Come now, what "
about your Roi d
e Prusse?”  
Hippolyte laughe
d as if ashamed 
of laughing.  
"“Oh, it’s no"
thing. I only wi
shed to say...�
� (he wanted to 
repeat a joke h
e had heard in V
ienna and which 
he had been tryi
ng all that eve
ning to get in) 
“I only wished
 to say that we 
are wrong to fig
ht pour le Roi 
de Prusse!”  
 Borís smiled c
"ircumspectly, so"
 that it might b
e taken as ironi
cal or apprecia
tive according t
o the way the jo
ke was received.
 Everybody laug
hed.  “Your 
"joke is too bad,"
 it’s witty bu
"t unjust,” sai"
d Anna Pávlovn
"a, shaking her l"
ittle shriveled 
finger at him. 
 “We are not 
fighting pour le
" Roi de Prusse, "
but for right pr
"inciples.
Oh, t"
hat wicked Princ
e Hippolyte!” 
she said.  The
 conversation di
d not flag all e
vening and turne
d chiefly on the
 political news
. It became part
icularly animate
d toward the end
 of the evening
 when the reward
s bestowed by th
e Emperor were m
entioned.  “
You know N— N�
�� received a sn
uffbox with the

the man of profo

� “Why shouldn

“Pardon me! A

�There are prece

When everybody r

again turned to 
"Borís, asking h"

caressing signi

It is of great i

"” she said, tu"

"Pávlovna, and A"
"nna Pávlovna, w"

 Hélène’s wi
sh.  It seemed
 as if from some
 words Borís ha
d spoken that ev

"
Prussian army, "
Hélène had sud
denly found it n
ecessary to see 
him. She seemed
 to promise to e

 Tuesday evening

 Hélène’s sp

B"

   CHAPTER VII
I  The war was
 flaming up and 
nearing the Russ
ian frontier. Ev
erywhere one he
ard curses on Bo
"naparte, “the "
enemy of mankind
.” Militiamen 
and recruits we
re being enrolle
d in the village
"s, and from the "
seat of war cam
e contradictory 
"news, false as u"
sual and therefo
re variously in
terpreted. The l
ife of old Princ
"e Bolkónski, Pr"
"ince Andrew, and"
 Princess Mary 
had greatly chan
ged since 1805. 
  In 1806 the o
ld prince was ma
de one of the ei
ght commanders i
n chief then ap
pointed to super
vise the enrollm
ent decreed thro
ughout Russia. 
Despite the weak
"ness of age, whi"
ch had become pa
rticularly notic
eable since the
 time when he th
ought his son ha
"d been killed, h"
e did not think 
 it right to ref
use a duty to wh
ich he had been 
appointed by the
 Emperor himsel
"f, and this fres"
h opportunity fo
r action gave hi
m new energy an
d strength. He w
as continually t
raveling through
 the three provi
nces entrusted 
"to him, was peda"
ntic in the fulf
illment of his d
"uties, severe
t"
o cruel with his
" subordinates, a"
nd went into eve
rything down to 
the minutest de
tails himself. P
rincess Mary had
 ceased taking l
essons in mathe
matics from her 
"father, and when"
 the old prince 
was at home went
 to his study w
ith the wet nurs
e and little Pri
nce Nicholas (as
 his grandfathe
r called him). T
he baby Prince N
icholas lived wi
th his wet nurs
e and nurse Sáv
ishna in the lat
e princess’ ro
oms and Princess
 Mary spent mos
t of the day in 
"the nursery, tak"
ing a mother’s
 place to her l
ittle nephew as 
best she could. 
Mademoiselle Bou
"rienne, too, see"
med passionatel
y fond of the bo
"y, and Princess "
Mary often depri
ved herself to 
give her friend 
the pleasure of 
dandling the lit
tle angel—as s
he called her n
ephew—and play
ing with him.  
 Near the altar 
of the church at
 Bald Hills ther
e was a chapel o
ver the tomb of
 the little prin
"cess, and in thi"
s chapel was a m
arble monument 
brought from Ita
"ly, representing"
 an angel with o
utspread wings r
eady to fly upw
ards. The angel�
��s upper lip wa
s slightly raise
d as though abo
"ut to smile, and"
 once on coming 
out of the chape
l Prince Andrew 
and Princess Ma
ry admitted to o
ne another that 
the angel’s fa
ce reminded the
m strangely of t
he little prince
ss. But what was
" still stranger,"
 though of this
 Prince Andrew s
aid nothing to h
"is sister, was t"
hat in the expr
ession the sculp
tor had happened
 to give the ang
"el’s face, Pri"
nce Andrew read
 the same mild r
eproach he had r
ead on the face 
of his dead wif
"e: “Ah, why ha"
ve you done this
 to me?”  So
on after Prince 
Andrew’s retur
n the old prince
 made over to hi
m a large estat
"e, Boguchárovo,"
 about twenty-fi
ve miles from Ba
ld Hills. Partl
y because of the
 depressing memo
ries associated 
"with Bald Hills,"
 partly because
 Prince Andrew d
id not always fe
el equal to bear
ing with his fa
ther’s peculia
"rities, and part"
ly because he ne
"eded solitude,
"
Prince Andrew ma
de use of Boguch
"árovo, began bu"
ilding and spent
 most of his ti
me there.  Aft
er the Austerlit
z campaign Princ
e Andrew had fir
mly resolved not
 to continue hi
s military servi
"ce, and when the"
 war recommenced
 and everybody 
"had to serve, he"
 took a post und
er his father in
 the recruitmen
t so as to avoid
 active service.
 The old prince 
and his son see
med to have chan
ged roles since 
the campaign of 
1805. The old ma
"n,
roused by ac"
"tivity, expected"
 the best result
s from the new c
"ampaign,
while "
Prince Andrew on
" the contrary, t"
aking no part in
 the war and se
cretly regrettin
"g this, saw only"
 the dark side. 
  On February 2
"6, 1807, the old"
 prince set off 
on one of his ci
rcuits. Prince 
Andrew remained 
at Bald Hills as
 usual during hi
s father’s ab
sence. Little Ni
cholas had been 
unwell for four 
days. The coachm
an who had driv
en the old princ
e to town return
ed bringing pape
rs and letters 
for Prince Andre
w.  Not findin
g the young prin
ce in his study 
the valet went w
ith the letters
 to Princess Mar
y’s apartments
", but did not fi"
nd him there. He
 was told that 
the prince had g
one to the nurse
ry.  “If you
" please, your ex"
"cellency, Pétru"
sha has brought 
"some papers,”"
 said one of the
 nursemaids to P
rince Andrew who
 was sitting on 
a child’s lit
"tle chair while,"
 frowning and wi
th trembling han
"ds, he
poured d"
rops from a medi
cine bottle into
 a wineglass hal
f full of water.
  “What is i
t?” he said cr
"ossly, and, his "
hand shaking un
"intentionally, h"
e poured too man
y drops into the
 glass. He threw
 the mixture on
to the floor and
 asked for some 
more water. The 
maid brought it
.  There were 
in the room a ch
"ild’s cot, two"
" boxes, two armc"
"hairs, a
table,"
 a child’s tab
"le, and the litt"
le chair on whic
h Prince Andrew 
 was sitting. Th
e curtains were 
"drawn, and a sin"
gle candle was b
urning on the t
"able, screened b"
y a bound music 
book so that the
 light did not f
all on the cot.

“My dear,�"

"
“Oh, leave o"
"ff, you always t"
alk nonsense and
 keep putting th

this is what com

d Prince Andrew 
in an exasperat

ently meaning to
 wound his siste
r.  “My dear
", really... it�"
�s better not to

"
said the princes
s in a tone of e
ntreaty.  Prin
ce Andrew got up
 and went on tip
toe up to the li

ass in hand.  
 “Perhaps we�

� he said hesita
ting.  “As y

"
Princess Mary, "
evidently intimi
dated and confus
ed that her opin

ed. She drew her
 brother’s att
ention to the ma
id who was call
ing him in a whi

the second night
 that neither of
" them had slept,"
 watching the bo
y who was in a 
high fever. Thes
"e last days, mis"
trusting their h
ousehold doctor
 and expecting a
nother for whom 
they had sent to
" town, they had"
 been trying fir
st one remedy an
d then another. 
Worn out by slee
plessness and a
nxiety they thre
w their burden o
f sorrow on one 
another and rep
roached and disp
uted with each o
ther.  “Pét
rusha has come w
ith papers from 
"your father,” "
whispered the m
aid.  Prince A
ndrew went out. 
  “Devil take
 them!” he mut
"tered, and after"
 listening to th
e verbal instru
ctions his fathe
r had sent and t
aking the corres
pondence and his
 father’s let
"ter, he returned"
 to the nursery.
  “Well?” 
he asked.  “
Still the same. 
"Wait, for heaven"
’s sake. Karl 
Ivánich always 
says that sleep
 is more importa
nt than anything
",” whispered P"
rincess Mary wi
th a sigh.  Pr
ince Andrew went
 up to the child
 and felt him. H
e was burning ho
t.  “Confoun
d you and your K
arl Ivánich!”
 He took the gla

ps and again wen
t up to the cot.
"

“Andrew, d"
on’t!” said 
Princess Mary. 
 But he scowled
 at her angrily 
though also with
 suffering in hi
"s eyes,

oped glass in ha

"wish it,” he s"
aid. “I beg yo

”  Princess 
Mary shrugged he
r shoulders but 
took the glass s
ubmissively and
 calling the nur
se began giving 
the medicine. Th
e child screamed
 hoarsely. Prin
ce Andrew winced
" and, clutching "
"his head, went o"
ut and sat down
 on a sofa in th
e next room.  
He still had all
 the letters in 
his hand. Openin
g them mechanica
lly he began re
ading. The old p
"rince, now and t"
hen using abbrev

"
in his large elo

"Yes, yes, he’s"

 I have certain

��I begin ab ovo
. ‘The enemy o

",
attacks the P"
russians. The Pr
ussians are our 
faithful allies 
who have only b
etrayed us three
 times in three 
years. We take u
"p their cause, b"
ut it turns out
 that ‘the ene
my of the human 
race’ pays no 
heed to our fin
e speeches and i
n his rude and s
avage way throws
 himself on the 
 Prussians witho
ut giving them t
ime to finish th
e parade they ha
"d begun,
and in"
 two twists of t
he hand he break
s them to smithe
reens and instal
ls himself in t

 the King of Pru

 May I have suc

 “The head of

"�In short, hopin"

 within sight of

 his corps who 
are within sight
 of the enemy an

was won or lost.
 Those who retr
eat after a batt

is what we say; 
and according to
 that it is we 
who lost the bat

" In short, we re"

 battle but send
 a courier to Pe

"nnigsen, hoping "
to receive from 
Petersburg the 
post of commande
r in chief as a 
reward for his v
"ictory, does not"
 give up the co
mmand of the arm
y to General Bux

this interregnum
 we begin a ver
y original and i
nteresting serie
s of maneuvers. 
Our aim is no l
"onger, as it sho"
"uld be, to avoid"
 or attack the e
"nemy, but solely"
 to avoid Gener

o by right of se
niority should b

 aim that after

rs that enabled 
us to escape him
. Buxhöwden pur
sues us—we sc
uttle. He hardly
 crosses the riv
er to our side b
efore we recros
s to the other. 
At last our enem
"y, Buxhöwden, c"
atches us and a
ttacks. Both gen

 and the result 
is a challenge o
n Buxhöwden’
s part and an ep

��  At first P
rince Andrew rea
d with his eyes 
"only, but after "
"a while,
in spi"
te of himself (a
lthough he knew 
how far it was s
afe to trust Bi
"líbin), what he"
 had read began 
to interest him 
more and more. W
hen he had read
" thus far, he cr"
umpled the lette
r up and threw i
t away. It was 
not what he had 
read that vexed 
"him, but the fac"
t that the life 
out there in wh
ich he had now n
o part could per
turb him. He shu
"t his eyes,
rub"
bed his forehead
 as if to rid hi
mself of all int
erest in what he
"
had read, and "
listened to what
 was passing in 
the nursery. Sud
denly he though
t he heard a str
ange noise throu
gh the door. He 
was seized with 
 alarm lest some
thing should hav
e happened to th
e child while he
 was reading th
e letter. He wen
t on tiptoe to t
he nursery door 
and opened it. 
 Just as he wen
t in he saw that
 the nurse was h
iding something 
from him with a
 scared look and
 that Princess M
ary was no longe
r by the cot.  
"
“My dear,” "
he heard what se
emed to him her 
despairing whisp
er behind him. 
  As often happ
ens after long s
leeplessness and
" long anxiety, h"
e was seized by
 an unreasoning 
panic—it occur
red to him that 
the child was d
ead. All that he
 saw and heard s
eemed to confirm
 this terror.  
"
“All is over,"
"” he thought, "
and a cold sweat
 broke out on hi
s forehead. He 
went to the cot 
"in confusion, su"
re that he would
 find it empty 
and that the nur
se had been hidi
ng the dead baby
. He drew the c
urtain aside and
 for some time h
"is frightened, r"
estless eyes cou
ld not find the
 baby. At last h
e saw him: the r
osy boy had toss
ed about till he
 lay across the
 bed with his he
ad lower than th
"e pillow, and wa"
s smacking his 
lips in his slee
p and breathing 
evenly.  Princ
e Andrew was as 
glad to find the
" boy like that, "
as if he had al
ready lost him. 
He bent over him
" and, as his sis"
ter had taught h
"im,
tried with "
his lips whether
 the child was s
till feverish. T
he soft forehea
d was moist. Pri
nce Andrew touch
ed the head with
 his hand; even 
 the hair was we
"t, so profusely "
had the child pe
rspired. He was 
"not dead,
but e"
vidently the cri
sis was over and
 he was convales
cent. Prince And
rew longed to s
"natch up, to squ"
"eeze, to hold to"
" his heart, this"
 helpless littl
"e creature, but "
dared not do so.
 He stood over h
"im, gazing at hi"
s head and at t
he little arms a
nd legs which sh
owed under the b
lanket. He hear
d a rustle behin
d him and a shad
ow appeared unde
r the curtain of
 the cot. He di
d not look round
", but still gazi"
ng at the infant
’s face liste
ned to his regul
ar breathing. Th
e dark shadow wa
"s Princess Mary,"
 who had come u
p to the cot wit
h noiseless step
"s, lifted the cu"
"rtain,
and drop"
ped it again beh
ind her. Prince 
Andrew recognize
d her without l
ooking and held 
out his hand to 
her. She pressed
 it.  “He ha
"s perspired,” "
said Prince Andr
ew.  “I was 
coming to tell y
ou so.”  The
 child moved sli
ghtly in his sle
"ep, smiled, and "
rubbed his foreh
ead against the
 pillow.  Prin
ce Andrew looked
 at his sister. 
In the dim shado
w of the curtain
 her luminous e
yes shone more b
rightly than usu
al from the tear
s of joy that w
ere in them. She
 leaned over to 
her brother and 
"kissed him, slig"
htly catching t
he curtain of th
e cot. Each made
 the other a war
ning gesture an
d stood still in
 the dim light b
eneath the curta
in as if not wis
hing to leave t
hat seclusion wh
ere they three w
ere shut off fro
m all the world
. Prince Andrew 
was the first to
" move away, ruff"
ling his hair a
gainst the musli

".

“Yes, thi"

�� he said with 
a sigh.     
  CHAPTER X  
Soon after his a
dmission to the 
Masonic Brotherh
"ood, Pierre went"
 to the Kiev pr
"ovince, where he"
 had the greates
t number of serf
"s, taking with
"
him full directi
ons which he had
 written down fo
r his own guidan
ce as to what h
e should do on h
is estates.  W
hen he reached K
iev he sent for 
all his stewards
 to the head off
ice and explain
ed to them his i
ntentions and wi
shes. He told th
em that steps w
ould be taken im
mediately to fre
e his serfs—an
d that till then
 they were not 
to be overburden
"ed with labor, w"
omen while nursi
ng their babies 
 were not to be 
"sent to work, as"
sistance was to 
be given to the 
"serfs,
punishme"
nts were to be a
dmonitory and no
"t corporal, and "
"hospitals,
asyl"
"ums, and schools"
 were to be esta
blished on all t
he estates. Some
 of the steward
s (there were se
militerate forem
en among them) l
istened with al
"arm, supposing t"
hese words to me
an that the youn
g count was disp
leased with the
ir management an
d embezzlement o
"f money, some af"
ter their first 
 fright were amu
sed by Pierre’
s lisp and the n
ew words they ha
d not heard bef
"ore, others simp"
ly enjoyed heari
ng how the maste
"r talked, while"
 the cleverest a
"mong them, inclu"
ding the chief s
"teward, understo"
od from this sp
eech how they co
uld best handle 
the master for t
heir own ends. 
 The chief stew
ard expressed gr
eat sympathy wit
h Pierre’s int
"entions,
but re"
marked that besi
des these change
s it would be ne
cessary to go in
to the general 
state of affairs
 which was far f
rom satisfactory
.  Despite Cou
nt Bezúkhov’s
 enormous wealth
", since he had c"
ome into an inc
ome which was sa
id to amount to 
five hundred tho
usand rubles a y
"ear,
Pierre fel"
t himself far po
orer than when h
is father had ma
de him an allow
ance of ten thou
sand rubles. He 
had a dim percep
tion of the fol
lowing budget: 
"
About 80,000 w"
ent in payments 
on all the estat
es to the Land B
"ank, about
30,0"
00 went for the 
upkeep of the es
tate near Moscow
", the town house"
",
and the allow"
ance to the thre
e princesses; ab
"out 15,000 was g"
iven in pension
s and the same a
mount for asylum
"s; 150,000 alimo"
ny was sent to 
the countess; ab
"out 70,000 went "
for interest on 
debts. The build
ing of a new ch
"urch, previously"
" begun, had cost"
" about 10,000 in"
 each of the las
"t
two years, an"
d he did not kno
"w how the rest, "
"about 100,000 ru"
"bles, was
spent"
", and almost eve"
ry year he was o
bliged to borrow
. Besides this t
he chief stewar
d wrote every ye
ar telling him o
f fires and bad 
"harvests,
or of"
 the necessity o
f rebuilding fac
tories and works
hops. So the fir
st task Pierre 
had to face was 
one for which he
 had very little
 aptitude or in
clination—prac
tical business. 
  He discussed 
estate affairs e
very day with hi
s chief steward.
 But he felt th
at this did not 
forward matters 
at all. He felt 
that these cons
ultations were d
etached from rea
l affairs and di
d not link up wi
th them or make
 them move. On t
"he one hand, the"
 chief steward p
ut the state of
 things to him i
n the very worst
" light, pointing"
 out the necessi
ty of paying of
f the debts and 
undertaking new 
activities with 
"serf labor,
to "
which Pierre did
 not agree. On t
"he other hand, P"
ierre demanded t
hat steps shoul
d be taken to li
berate the serfs
", which the stew"
ard met by show
ing the necessit
y of first payin
g off the loans 
from the Land Ba
"nk,
and the con"
sequent impossib
ility of a speed
y emancipation. 
  The steward d
id not say it wa
s quite impossib
"le, but suggeste"
d selling the f
orests in the pr
ovince of Kostro
"má, the land lo"
wer down the riv
"er,
and the Cri"
"mean estate, in "
order to make it
 possible: all o
f which operati
ons according to
 him were connec
ted with such co
mplicated measu
res—the remova
l of injunctions
", petitions, per"
"mits, and so
on"
—that Pierre b
ecame quite bewi
ldered and only 
replied:  “Y
"es, yes, do so.�"
��  Pierre had
 none of the pra
ctical persisten
ce that would ha
ve enabled him 
to attend to the
 business himsel
f and so he disl
iked it and only
 tried to prete
nd to the stewar
d that he was at
tending to it. T
he steward for 
his part tried t
o pretend to the
 count that he c
onsidered these 
 consultations v
ery valuable for
 the proprietor 
and troublesome 
to himself.  
In Kiev Pierre f
ound some people
" he knew, and st"
rangers hastened
 to make his ac
quaintance and j
oyfully welcomed
 the rich newcom
"er, the
largest"
 landowner of th
e province. Temp
tations to Pierr
e’s greatest 
weakness—the o
ne to which he h
ad confessed whe
n admitted to th
e Lodge—were 
so strong that h
e could not resi
st them. Again w
"hole days,
week"
"s, and months of"
 his life passed
 in as great a r
ush and were as 
much occupied w
ith evening part
"ies, dinners, lu"
"nches, and balls"
", giving him
no"
 time for reflec
"tion, as in Pete"
rsburg. Instead 
of the new life 
he had hoped to
 lead he still l
ived the old lif
"e, only in new s"
urroundings.  
Of the three pre
cepts of Freemas
onry Pierre real
ized that he did
 not fulfill th
e one which enjo
ined every Mason
 to set an examp
le of moral lif
"e, and that of t"
he seven virtues
 he lacked two�
�morality and th
e love of death
. He consoled hi
mself with the t
hought that he f
ulfilled anothe
r of the precept
s—that of refo
rming the human 
race—and had 
other virtues—
love of his neig
"hbor, and especi"
ally generosity.
  In the sprin
g of 1807 he dec
ided to return t
o Petersburg. On
 the way he int
ended to visit a
ll his estates a
nd see for himse
lf how far his o
rders had been 
carried out and 
in what state we
re the serfs who
m God had entru
sted to his care
 and whom he int
ended to benefit
.  The chief s
"teward, who cons"
idered the young
 count’s attem
pts almost insa
ne—unprofitabl
"e to himself, to"
" the count, and "
to the serfs—m
ade some conces
sions. Continuin
g to represent t
he liberation of
 the serfs as i
"mpracticable, he"
 arranged for th
e erection of la
rge buildings�
"�schools, hospit"
"als, and asylums"
—on all the es
tates before th
e master arrived
. Everywhere pre
parations were m
ade not for cer
emonious welcome
s (which he knew
 Pierre would no
"t like), but for"
 just such grat
efully religious
" ones, with offe"
rings of icons a
nd the bread an
d salt of hospit
"ality, as, accor"
ding to his unde
rstanding of his
"
master, would "
touch and delude
 him.  The sou
"thern spring, th"
e comfortable ra
pid traveling in
 a Vienna carri
"age, and the sol"
itude of the roa
"d, all had a gla"
ddening effect o
n Pierre. The e
states he had no
t before visited
 were each more 
picturesque tha
n the other; the
 serfs everywher
e seemed thrivin
g and touchingly
 grateful for t
he benefits conf
erred on them. E
verywhere were r
"eceptions,
whic"
h though they em
barrassed Pierre
 awakened a joyf
ul feeling in th
e depth of his 
heart. In one pl
ace the peasants
 presented him w
ith bread and s
alt and an icon 
of Saint Peter a
"nd Saint Paul, a"
sking permission
",
as a mark of "
their gratitude 
for the benefits
 he had conferre
"d on them,
to b"
uild a new chant
ry to the church
 at their own ex
pense in honor 
of Peter and Pau
"l, his patron sa"
ints. In another
 place the women
 with infants i
n arms met him t
o thank him for 
releasing them f
rom hard work. 
On a third estat
"e the priest, be"
"aring a cross, c"
ame to meet him
 surrounded by c
"hildren whom, by"
 the count’s g
"enerosity, he wa"
s instructing i
"n reading, writi"
"ng, and religion"
. On all his est
ates Pierre saw
 with his own ey
es brick buildin
gs erected or in
 course of erect
"ion,
all on one"
" plan, for hospi"
"tals, schools, a"
"nd almshouses, w"
hich were soon 
to be opened. Ev
erywhere he saw 
the stewards’ 
"accounts, accord"
ing to which th
e serfs’ manor
ial labor had be
"en diminished, a"
nd heard the to
uching thanks of
 deputations of 
serfs in their f
ull-skirted blue
 coats.  What
 Pierre did not 
know was that th
e place where th
ey presented him
 with bread and
 salt and wished
 to build a chan
try in honor of 
Peter and Paul 
was a market vil
lage where a fai
r was held on St
". Peter’s day,"
 and that the r
ichest peasants 
(who formed the 
deputation) had 
begun the chant
"ry long before, "
but that nine te
nths of the peas
ants in that vi
llages were in a
 state of the gr
eatest poverty. 
He did not know 
that since the 
nursing mothers 
were no longer s
ent to work on h
"is land, they
d"
id still harder 
work on their ow
n land. He did n
ot know that the
 priest who met
 him with the cr
oss oppressed th
e peasants by hi
"s exactions, and"
 that the pupil
s’ parents wep
t at having to l
et him take thei
r children and 
secured their re
lease by heavy p
ayments. He did 
not know that th
e brick buildin
"gs, built to pla"
"n, were being bu"
ilt by serfs who
se manorial lab
or was thus incr
"eased, though le"
ssened on paper.
 He did not know
 that where the
 steward had sho
wn him in the ac
counts that the 
serfs’ paymen
ts had been dimi
nished by a thir
"d, their obligat"
ory manorial wor
k had been incr
eased by a half.
 And so Pierre w
as delighted wit
h his visit to 
his estates and 
quite recovered 
the philanthropi
c mood in which 
 he had left Pet
"ersburg, and wro"
te enthusiastic 
letters to his 
“brother-instr
uctor” as he c
alled the Grand 
Master.  “Ho
"w easy it is, ho"
w little effort 
"it needs, to do "
"so much good,”"
 thought Pierre
", “and how lit"
tle attention we
 pay to it!” 
 He was pleased
 at the gratitud
"e he received, b"
ut felt abashed 
at receiving it
. This gratitude
 reminded him of
 how much more h
e might do for 
"these simple, ki"
ndly people.  
The chief stewar
"d, a very stupid"
 but cunning man
 who saw perfect
ly through the 
naïve and intel
ligent count and
 played with him
" as with
a toy,"
 seeing the effe
ct these prearra
nged receptions 
"had on Pierre,
"
pressed him stil
l harder with pr
oofs of the impo
ssibility and ab
ove all the use
lessness of free
"ing the serfs, w"
ho were quite ha
ppy as it was. 
 Pierre in his 
secret soul agre
ed with the stew
ard that it woul
d be difficult 
to imagine happi
"er people, and t"
hat God only kne
w what would ha
ppen to them whe
n they were free
", but he insiste"
"d, though reluct"
"antly,
on what "
he thought right
. The steward pr
omised to do all
 in his power to
 carry out the 
count’s wishes
", seeing clearly"
 that not only w
ould the count 
never be able to
 find out whethe
r all measures h
ad been taken fo
r the sale of t
he land and fore
sts and to relea
se them from the
" Land Bank,
but"
 would probably 
never even inqui
re and would nev
er know that the
 newly erected 
buildings were s
tanding empty an
d that the serfs
 continued to g
ive in money and
 work all that o
ther people’s 
serfs gave—tha
"t is
to say, al"
l that could be 
got out of them.
      CHAP
TER XI  Return
ing from his jou
rney through Sou
th Russia in the
 happiest state 
"
of mind, Pierre"
 carried out an 
intention he had
 long had of vis
iting his frien
"d Bolkónski, wh"
om he had not se
en for two years
.  Boguchárov
o lay in a flat 
uninteresting pa
rt of the countr
y among fields 
and forests of f
"ir and birch, wh"
ich were partly 
cut down. The h
ouse lay behind 
a newly dug pond
 filled with wat
er to the brink 
and with banks 
still bare of gr
ass. It was at t
he end of a vill
age that stretc
hed along the hi
ghroad in the mi
dst of a young c
opse in which we
re a few fir tr
ees.  The home
stead consisted 
of a threshing f
"loor, outhouses,"
" stables, a
bat"
"hhouse, a lodge,"
 and a large bri
ck house with se
micircular faça
de still in cou
rse of construct
ion. Round the h
ouse was a garde
n newly laid ou
t. The fences an
d gates were new
 and solid; two 
fire pumps and a
"
water cart, pa"
"inted green, sto"
od in a shed; th
e paths were str
"aight,
the brid"
ges were strong 
and had handrail
s. Everything bo
re an impress of
 tidiness and g
ood management. 
Some domestic se
"rfs Pierre met, "
in reply to inq
uiries as to whe
re the prince li
"ved, pointed out"
 a small newly 
built lodge clos
e to the pond. A
"ntón, a man who"
 had looked afte
r Prince Andrew
" in his boyhood,"
 helped Pierre o
ut of his carria
"ge, said that th"
e prince was at
" home, and showe"
d him into a cle
an little antero
om.  Pierre wa
s struck by the 
modesty of the s
mall though clea
n house after t
he brilliant sur
roundings in whi
ch he had last m
et his friend in
 Petersburg.  
 He quickly ente
red the small re
ception room wit
h its still-unpl
astered wooden 
walls redolent o
"f pine, and woul"
d have gone fart
"her, but Antón"
 ran ahead on ti
ptoe and knocked
 at a door.  �

 a chair being p
ushed back.  
Pierre went with
 rapid steps to 
the door and sud
denly came face 
to face with Pr
"ince Andrew, who"
 came out frowni
ng and looking o

aced him and lif
ting his spectac

riend on the che

t him closely.

“Well, I did"
" not expect you,"
" I am very glad,"
” said Prince 
Andrew.  Pierr
e said nothing; 
he looked fixedl
y at his friend 
with surprise. H
e was struck by
 the change in h
im. His words we
re kindly and th
ere was a smile
 on his lips and
" face, but his e"
yes were dull an
d lifeless and i
n spite of his 
evident wish to 
do so he could n
ot give them a j
oyous and glad 
sparkle. Prince 
Andrew had grown
" thinner, paler,"
 and more manly
"-looking, but wh"
at amazed and es
tranged Pierre t
ill he got used 
 to it were his 
inertia and a wr
inkle on his bro
w indicating pro
longed concentr
ation on some on
e thought.  As
 is usually the 
case with people
 meeting after a
 prolonged separ
"ation,
it was l"
ong before their
 conversation co
uld settle on an
ything. They pu
t questions and 
gave brief repli
es about things 
they knew ought 
to be talked ov
er at length. At
 last the conver
sation gradually
 settled on som
e of the topics 
at first lightly
 touched on: the
"ir past life, pl"
ans for the fut
"ure, Pierre’s "
journeys and occ
"upations, the wa"
"r, and so
on. T"
he preoccupation
 and despondency
 which Pierre ha
d noticed in his
 friend’s loo
k was now still 
more clearly exp
ressed in the sm
ile with which 
he listened to P
"ierre, especiall"
y when he spoke 
with joyful ani
mation of the pa
st or the future
. It was as if P
rince Andrew wou
ld have liked t
o sympathize wit
h what Pierre wa
"s saying, but co"
uld not. The la
tter began to fe
el that it was i
n bad taste to s
peak of his ent
"husiasms, dreams"
", and hopes of h"
appiness or good
"ness, in Prince"
 Andrew’s pres
ence. He was ash
amed to express 
his new Masonic 
"views,
which ha"
d been particula
rly revived and 
strengthened by 
his late tour. 
He checked himse
"lf, fearing to s"
"eem naïve, yet "
he felt an irres
istible desire 
to show his frie
nd as soon as po
ssible that he w
as now a quite 
"different, and b"
"etter, Pierre th"
an he had been i
n Petersburg.  
 “I can’t te
ll you how much 
I have lived thr
ough since then.
 I hardly know 
myself again.”
"

“Yes, we h"
ave altered much
", very much, sin"
"ce then,” said"
 Prince Andrew.
"

“Well, and"
 you? What are y
our plans?”  
 “Plans!” re
peated Prince An
drew ironically.
 “My plans?”
" he said,
as if"
 astonished at t
he word. “Well
", you see, I’m"
 building. I mea
n to settle her
e altogether nex

 Pierre looked s
ilently and sear
chingly into Pri

"ace,
which had "
grown much older
".

“No, I me"
ant to ask...”
" Pierre began, b"
ut Prince Andrew
 interrupted hi
m.  “But why
 talk of me?... 
"Talk to me, yes,"
 tell me about y
our travels and
 all you have be
en doing on your
 estates.”  
Pierre began des
cribing what he 
had done on his 
"estates, trying "
as far as possi
ble to conceal h
is own part in t
he improvements 
that had been m
ade. Prince Andr
ew several times
 prompted Pierre
’s story of wh
at he had been 
"doing, as though"
 it were all an 
"old-time story, "
and he listened 
 not only withou
t interest but e
ven as if ashame
d of what Pierre
 was telling hi
m.  Pierre fel
t uncomfortable 
and even depress
ed in his friend
’s company an
d at last became
 silent.  “I
’ll tell you w
"hat, my dear fel"
"low,” said Pri"
"nce Andrew, who"
 evidently also 
felt depressed a
nd constrained w
"ith his visitor,"
 “I am only b

me to look round

imself:  “Ho

"inner, conversat"

"of it,” said P"

"
Pierre blushed,"
 as he always di
d when it was me
"ntioned, and sai"
d hurriedly: �
�I will tell you
 some time how i
t all happened. 
But you know it
" is all over, an"

 “Forever?” 
said Prince Andr
ew. “Nothing�

 “But you kno
w how it all end

 You heard of th
e duel?”  �
�And so you had 
to go through th
at too!”  �
�One thing I tha
nk God for is th
at I did not kil

aid Pierre.  
“Why so?” as
ked Prince Andre
w. “To kill a 
vicious dog is a
 very good thin
g really.”  
"“No, to kill a"
 man is bad—wr
ong.”  “Wh
y is it wrong?�
� urged Prince A
ndrew. “It is 
not given to man
 to know what i
s right and what
 is wrong. Men a
lways did and al
"ways will
err, "
and in nothing m
ore than in what
 they consider r
ight and wrong.�
��  “What do

"er is wrong,” "
"said Pierre, fee"
ling with pleas
ure that for the
 first time sinc
e his arrival Pr
ince Andrew was 
"
roused, had beg"
"un to talk, and "
wanted to expres
s what had broug
ht him to his p
resent state.  
 “And who has 
told you what is
 bad for another
 man?” he aske
d.  “Bad! Ba
d!” exclaimed 
Pierre. “We al
l know what is b
ad for ourselve
"s.”

“Yes,"
" we know that, b"
ut the harm I am
 conscious of in
 myself is some
thing I cannot i
nflict on others
",” said Prince"
" Andrew, growing"
 more and more 
animated and evi
dently wishing t
o express his ne
w outlook to Pi
erre. He spoke i
n French. “I o
nly know two ver
y real evils in 
 life: remorse a
nd illness. The 
only good is the
 absence of thos
e evils. To liv
e for myself avo
iding those two 
evils is my whol
e philosophy no
w.”  “And 
love of one’s 
"neighbor, and se"
lf-sacrifice?”
 began Pierre. 
"“No, I can’t"
 agree with you!
 To live only so
 as not to do ev
il and not to h
ave to repent is
 not enough. I l
"ived like that, "
I lived for mys
elf and ruined m
y life. And only
 now when I am l
"iving, or at lea"
st trying” (P
ierre’s modest
y made him corre
ct himself) “t

e I understood a
ll the happiness
" of life. No, I"
 shall not agree
" with you, and y"
ou do not really
 believe what yo

� Prince Andrew 
looked silently 
at Pierre with a
n ironic smile. 
  “When you s
"ee my sister, Pr"
"incess Mary, you"
’ll get on wit
"h her,”
he sa"
id. “Perhaps y
ou are right for

 added after a 
"short pause, “"
but everyone liv

ay you nearly ru

�And after all w
hat is glory? Th

 I have become

  “But what 
do you mean by l

"d Pierre,

that’s just th

ained Prince And

ooked at Pierre 
"with a mocking, "
challenging expr
ession. He evid
ently wished to 
draw him on.  
“You are jokin
"g,” replied Pi"
"erre, growing mo"
re and more exci
ted. “What er

there be in my w
ishing to do goo

 “And I have

“Yes, if you"
 put it like tha

Killed them, y"

frowning angrily

  Prince Andrew

"nce, and he spok"
e readily and r
apidly like a ma

“Oh, that i"

"“No, thank you"

 “now there’

 “Then you ar

 “I am.”  
He paused a litt
le while.  “
And why do you s
erve?”  “W
"hy, for this rea"
son! My father i
s one of the mos
t remarkable men
 of his time. B
ut he is growing
" old, and though"
 not exactly cru

t he is terribl
"e, and now he ha"
s this authority
 of a commander 
in chief of the

 had a paymaster

mile. “So I am

"

“Well, ther"

"
“Yes, but it "
is not as you im

 Andrew continue
d. “I did not

 the least care 
about that scoun

 who had stolen 
some boots from 
the recruits; I 
should even have
 been very glad
 to see him hang

rry for my fathe

is for myself.�
�  Prince Andr
ew grew more and
 more animated. 
His eyes glitter
ed feverishly w
hile he tried to
 prove to Pierre
 that in his act
ions there was n
o desire to do 
good to his neig
hbor.  “Ther
"e now, you wish "
to liberate your
" serfs,” he co"
ntinued; “that
 is a very good
" thing, but not "
for you—I don�
��t suppose you 
ever had anyone
 flogged or sent
 to Siberia—an
d still less for
 your serfs. If 
 they are beaten
", flogged, or se"
"nt to Siberia, I"
 don’t suppose
 they are any t
he worse off. In
 Siberia they le
ad the same anim
"al life, and the"
 stripes on the
"ir bodies heal, "
and they are hap
py as before. Bu
t it is a good 
thing for propri
etors who perish
" morally, bring "
remorse upon th
"emselves, stifle"
 this remorse an
"d grow callous, "
as a result of b
eing able to in
flict punishment
s justly and unj
ustly. It is tho
se people I pit
"y, and for their"
 sake I should l
ike to liberate 
the serfs. You 
may not have see
"n, but I have se"
"en, how good men"
 brought up in t

n they grow more
" irritable,
bec"
ome cruel and ha
"rsh, are conscio"
"us of it, but ca"
nnot restrain t
hemselves and gr
ow more and more

 Prince Andrew 
spoke so earnest
ly that Pierre c
ould not help th
inking that the
se thoughts had 
been suggested t
o Prince Andrew 
by his father�
�s case.  He d
id not reply.  
 “So that’s 
what I’m sorry
 for—human dig

"No, no! A thousa"

hall never agree

id Pierre.   
    CHAPTER X
II  In the eve
ning Andrew and 
Pierre got into 
the open carriag
e and drove to 
Bald Hills. Prin

"ing at Pierre, b"
roke the silence
 now and then w
ith remarks whic
h showed that he
 was in a good t
emper.  Pointi
ng to the fields
", he spoke of th"
e improvements h
e was making in 
 his husbandry. 
  Pierre remain
ed gloomily sile
"nt, answering in"
 monosyllables a
nd apparently i
mmersed in his o
wn thoughts.  
He was thinking 
that Prince Andr
"ew was unhappy, "
"had gone astray,"
 did not see th
"e true light, an"
"d that he, Pierr"
"e, ought to aid,"
" enlighten, and"
 raise him. But 
as soon as he th
ought of what he
" should say, he "
felt that Princ
e Andrew with on
"e word, one argu"
"ment, would upse"
t all his teachi
"ng,
and he shra"
nk from beginnin
"g, afraid of exp"
osing to possibl
e ridicule what
 to him was prec
ious and sacred.
"

“No, but w"
hy do you think 
so?” Pierre su
"ddenly began, lo"
wering his head
 and looking lik
e a bull about t
"o charge, “why"
 do you think so
? You should no
t think so.” 
 “Think? What
 about?” asked
 Prince Andrew w
ith surprise.  
"
“About life, "
about man’s de
stiny. It can’
t be so. I mysel
f thought like 
"that, and do you"
 know what saved
 me? Freemasonry
"! No, don’t

mile. Freemasonr
y is not a relig
ious ceremonial 
"sect, as I thoug"
ht it was: Free
masonry is the b
est expression o
"f the best, the "
"eternal,
aspect"
s of humanity.�
�  And he bega
n to explain Fre
emasonry as he u
nderstood it to 
Prince Andrew. 
He said that Fre
emasonry is the 
teaching of Chri
stianity freed 
from the bonds o

"f equality, brot"
"herhood,
and lo"
ve.  “Only o

"is a dream,” s"
aid Pierre. “U

.  Prince Andr
"ew, looking stra"

erre’s words. 
"More than once, "
when the noise o

vented his catc

" said, he asked "
him to repeat it

pe"
culiar glow that
 came into Princ
e Andrew’s eye
s and by his sil
"ence,
Pierre sa"
w that his words
 were not in vai
n and that Princ
e Andrew would 
not interrupt hi
m or laugh at wh
at he said.  T
hey reached a ri
ver that had ove
rflowed its bank
s and which they
 had to cross b
y ferry. While t
he carriage and 
horses were bein
"g placed on it,"
 they also stepp
ed on the raft. 
  Prince Andrew
", leaning his ar"
ms on the raft r
"ailing, gazed si"
lently at the f
looding waters g
littering in the
 setting sun.  
"
“Well, what d"
o you think abou
t it?” Pierre 
asked. “Why ar
e you silent?�
�  “What do 
I think about it
? I am listening
 to you. It’s 
all very well..
.. You say: join
 our brotherhood
 and we will sho
w you the aim of
"
life, the dest"
"iny of man, and "
the laws which g
overn the world.
 But who are we
? Men. How is it
 you know everyt
hing? Why do I a
lone not see wha
t you see? You 
see a reign of g
oodness and trut
"h on earth, but "
I don’t see i
t.”  Pierre 
interrupted him.
  “Do you be
lieve in a futur
e life?” he as
ked.  “A fut
ure life?” Pri
nce Andrew repea
"ted, but Pierre,"
 giving him no 
"time to reply, t"
ook the repetiti
"on for a denial,"
 the more readil
y as he knew Pr
ince Andrew’s 
former atheistic
 convictions.  
 “You say you 
can’t see a re
ign of goodness 
and truth on ear
th. Nor could I
", and it cannot "
be seen if one l
ooks on our life
 here as the end
 of everything.
" On earth, here "
on this earth”
 (Pierre pointed
 to the fields)
", “there is no"
" truth, all is f"
alse and evil; b
ut in the unive
"rse, in the whol"
e universe there
 is a kingdom of
" truth, and we w"
ho are now the 
children of eart
h are—eternall
y—children of 
the whole unive
rse. Don’t I f
eel in my soul t
hat I am part of
 this vast harm
onious whole? Do
n’t I feel tha
t I form one lin
"k, one step, bet"
ween the lower 
and higher being
"s, in this vast "
harmonious multi
tude of beings 
in whom the Deit
y—the Supreme 
Power if you pre
fer the term—i
s manifest? If 
"I see, clearly s"
"ee, that ladder "
leading from pla
"nt to man,
why "
should I suppose
 it breaks off a
t me and does no
t go farther and
 farther? I fee
l that I cannot 
"vanish, since no"
thing vanishes i
"n this
world, b"
ut that I shall 
always exist and
 always have exi
sted. I feel th
at beyond me and
 above me there 
"are spirits, and"
 that in this wo
rld there is tr
uth.”  “Ye
"s, that is Herde"
"r’s theory,”"
 said Prince And
"rew, “but it i"
s not that whic
h can convince m
"e, dear friend�"
�life and death 
are what convin
ce. What convinc
es is when one s
ees a being dear
" to one, bound
"
up with one’s 
"own life, before"
 whom one was to
 blame and had h
oped to make it
 right” (Princ
e Andrew’s voi
ce trembled and 
"he turned away),"
 “and suddenl
y that being is 
seized with pain
", suffers, and c"
eases to exist.
... Why? It cann
ot be that there
 is no answer. A
nd I believe the
re is.... That�
��s what convinc
"es, that is what"
 has convinced m
"e,” said
Prin"
ce Andrew.  �
"�Yes, yes, of co"
"urse,” said Pi"
"erre, “isn’t"
 that what I’m
 saying?”  
“No. All I say
 is that it is n
ot argument that
 convinces me of
 the necessity 
of a future life
", but this: when"
 you go hand in 
hand with someo
ne and all at on
ce that person v
"anishes there, i"
"nto nowhere, and"
 you yourself a
re left facing t
"hat abyss, and l"
ook in. And I ha
ve looked in...
".”

“Well,"
 that’s it the
n! You know that
 there is a ther
e and there is a
 Someone? There
 is the future l
ife. The Someone
 is—God.”  
 Prince Andrew d
id not reply. Th
e carriage and h
orses had long s
ince been taken
" off, onto the f"
"arther bank, and"
 reharnessed. Th
e sun had sunk h
alf below the h
orizon and an ev
ening frost was 
starring the pud
dles near the f
"erry, but Pierre"
" and Andrew, to "
the astonishment
" of the footmen,"
"
coachmen, and "
"ferrymen, still "
stood on the raf
t and talked.  
 “If there is 
a God and future
" life, there is "
"truth and good, "
and man’s hig
hest happiness c
onsists in striv
ing to attain th
em. We must liv
"e, we must love,"
 and we must bel
ieve that we liv
e not only today
 on this scrap 
"of earth, but ha"
ve lived and sha
"ll live forever,"
" there, in
the "
"Whole,” said P"
"ierre, and he po"
inted to the sky
.  Prince Andr
ew stood leaning
 on the railing 
of the raft list
ening to Pierre
", and he gazed w"
ith his eyes fix
ed on the red re
flection of the 
 sun gleaming on
 the blue waters
. There was perf
ect stillness. P
ierre became si
lent. The raft h
ad long since st
opped and only t
he waves of the 
 current beat so
ftly against it 
below. Prince An
drew felt as if 
the sound of th
e waves kept up 
a refrain to Pie
"rre’s words, w"
hispering:  �
"�It is true, bel"
ieve it.”  H
"e sighed, and gl"
anced with a rad
"iant, childlike,"
 tender look at 
 Pierre’s face
", flushed and ra"
"pturous, but yet"
 shy before his 
superior friend
".

“Yes, if "
it only were so!
” said Prince 
Andrew. “Howev
"er, it is
time "
"to get on,” he"
" added, and, ste"
pping off the ra
"ft, he looked up"
 at the sky to 
which Pierre had
" pointed, and fo"
r the first time
 since Austerli
tz saw that high
", everlasting sk"
y he had seen wh
ile lying on th
at battlefield; 
and something th
at had long been
" slumbering, som"
ething that was
 best within him
", suddenly awoke"
", joyful and you"
"thful, in his
s"
oul. It vanished
 as soon as he r
eturned to the c
ustomary conditi
ons of his life
", but he knew th"
at this feeling 
which he did not
 know how to de
velop existed wi
thin him. His me
eting with Pierr
e formed an epoc
h in Prince And
rew’s life. Th
ough outwardly h
e continued to l
ive in the same
" old way, inward"
ly he began a ne
w life.     
  CHAPTER XIII 
  It was gettin
g dusk when Prin
ce Andrew and Pi
erre drove up to
 the front entr
ance of the hous
e at Bald Hills.
 As they approac
"hed the house,
"
Prince Andrew wi
th a smile drew 
Pierre’s atten
tion to a commot
ion going on at
 the back porch.
" A woman, bent w"
"ith age, with a "
wallet on her b
"ack, and a short"
", long-haired, y"
oung man in a bl
ack garment had 
rushed back to 
the gate on seei
ng the carriage 
driving up. Two 
women ran out a
"fter them, and a"
"ll four, looking"
 round at the ca
"rriage, ran in d"
ismay up the st
eps of the back 
porch.  “Tho
se are Mary’s 
"‘God’s folk,"
’” said Prin
ce Andrew. “Th
ey have mistake
n us for my fath
er. This is the 
one matter in wh
ich she disobey
s him. He orders
 these pilgrims 
to be driven awa
"y, but she
rece"
ives them.”  
 “But what are
 ‘God’s folk
’?” asked Pi
erre.  Prince 
Andrew had no ti
me to answer. Th
e servants came 
out to meet them
",
and he asked "
where the old pr
ince was and whe
ther he was expe
cted back soon.
  The old prin
ce had gone to t
he town and was 
expected back an
y minute.  Pri
nce Andrew led P
ierre to his own
" apartments, whi"
ch were always k
ept in perfect 
order and readin
ess for him in h
is father’s ho
use; he himself
 went to the nur
sery.  “Let 
us go and see my
" sister,” he s"
aid to Pierre wh
en he returned. 
 “I have not f
"ound her yet, sh"
"e is hiding now,"
 sitting with he
r ‘God’s fo
lk.’ It will s
"erve her right, "
she will be conf
"used, but
you w"
ill see her ‘G
od’s folk.’ 
It’s really ve
ry curious.” 
 “What are �
�God’s folk’
?” asked Pierr
"e.

“Come, a"
nd you’ll see 
for yourself.”
  Princess Mar
y really was dis
concerted and re
d patches came o
n her face when
 they went in. I
"n her snug room,"
 with lamps burn
ing before the i
"con
stand, a yo"
ung lad with a l
ong nose and lon
"g hair, wearing "
a monk’s cass
"ock, sat on the "
"sofa beside her,"
 behind a samova
"r. Near them, in"
" an
armchair, s"
"at a thin, shriv"
"eled, old woman,"
 with a meek exp
ression on her 
childlike face. 
"

“Andrew, wh"
y didn’t you w
arn me?” said 
"the princess, wi"
th mild reproac
"h, as she stood "
before her pilgr
ims like a hen b
efore her chick
ens.  “Charm
ée de vous voir
. Je suis très 
contente de vous
" voir,” * she"
 said to Pierre 
as he kissed her
 hand. She had k
nown him as a ch
"ild, and
now hi"
s friendship wit
"h Andrew, his mi"
sfortune with hi
"s wife, and abov"
e all his kindl
"y, simple face d"
isposed her favo
rably toward him
. She looked at
 him with her be
autiful radiant 
eyes and seemed 
"to say, “I
li"
ke you very much
", but please don"
’t laugh at my
 people.” Afte
r exchanging th
e first greeting
"s, they sat down"
.      * “De
lighted to see y
ou. I am very gl
ad to see you.�
"�


“Ah, an"
d Ivánushka is 
here too!” sai
"d Prince Andrew,"
 glancing with 
a smile at the y
oung pilgrim.  
 “Andrew!” s
aid Princess Mar
"y, imploringly. "
“Il faut que v
ous sachiez que
 c’est une fem
"me,” * said Pr"
ince Andrew to P
ierre.  “And
"rew, au nom de D"
ieu!” *(2) Pri
ncess Mary repea
ted.       * �
��You must know 
that this is a w
oman.”      
 * (2) “For he
aven’s sake.�
�   It was ev
ident that Princ
e Andrew’s iro
nical tone towar
d the pilgrims 
and Princess Mar
y’s helpless a
ttempts to prote
ct them were the
ir customary lo
ng-established r
elations on the 
matter.  “Ma
"is, ma bonne ami"
"e,” said Princ"
"e Andrew, “vou"
s devriez au co
ntraire m’êtr
e reconnaissante
 de ce que j’e
xplique à Pierr
e votre intimit
é avec ce jeune
 homme.” *  
"     * “But, m"
"y dear, you ough"
t on the contrar
y to be grateful
 to      me for
 explaining to P
ierre your intim
acy with this yo
ung      man.�
�   “Really
?” said Pierre
", gazing over hi"
s spectacles wit
h curiosity and 
 seriousness (fo
r which Princess
 Mary was specia
lly grateful to 
him) into Iván
"ushka’s face, "
"who, seeing that"
 she was being s
"poken about, loo"
ked round at th
em all with craf
ty eyes.  Prin
cess Mary’s em
barrassment on h
er people’s ac
count was quite 
 unnecessary. Th
ey were not in t
he least abashed
". The old woman,"
 lowering her e
yes but casting 
side glances at 
"the newcomers, h"
ad turned her cu
p upside down a
nd placed a nibb
led bit of sugar
" beside it, and "
sat quietly in 
"her armchair, th"
ough hoping to b
e offered anothe
r cup of tea. I
"vánushka, sippi"
ng out of her sa
"ucer, looked wit"
h sly womanish e
yes from under 
her brows at the
 young men.  �
��Where have you
 been? To Kiev?�
�� Prince Andrew
 asked the old w
oman.  “I ha
"ve, good sir,”"
 she answered ga
rrulously. “Ju
st at Christmas
time I was deeme
d worthy to part
ake of the holy 
and heavenly sa
crament at the s
hrine of the sai

��I go by myself

 said Ivánushka
", trying to spea"

ce. “I only ca
me across Pelag�

éya interrupted
 her companion; 
she evidently wi
shed to tell wha
t she had seen.
  “In Kolyá

onderful blessin

at is it? Some n

ked Prince Andre
"w.

“Andrew,"

Mary. “Don’t

"No... why not, m"

" silent, only th"
e pilgrim woman 
went on in measu

"me, master, and "
the people say t
o me: ‘A great

from the cheeks 
of our blessed M

"

“All right,"
" all right, you "
can tell us afte
"rwards,” said "
"Princess
Mary, "
flushing.  “
"Let me ask her,�"
�� said Pierre. 
“Did you see i
t yourselves?”
 he inquired. 
"
“Oh, yes, ma"

“But, d"
"ear me, that mus"
t be a fraud!”
" said Pierre, na"
"ïvely, who had"
 listened attent
ively to the pil
"grim.

“Oh, "
"master, what are"
 you saying?” 
exclaimed the ho
rrified Pelagé
"ya, turning to P"
rincess Mary for
 support.  “
They impose on t
"he people,” he"
 repeated.  �
�Lord Jesus Chri
st!” exclaimed
 the pilgrim wom
"an, crossing her"
"self.
“Oh, do"
"n’t speak so, "
master! There wa
s a general who 
did not believe
", and said, ‘T"
"he monks cheat,�"
�� and as soon a
s he’d said it
 he went blind.
 And he dreamed 
that the Holy Vi

he Kiev catacom
bs came to him a
"nd said, ‘Beli"
eve in me and I

egged: ‘Take m

 goes up to her 
and falls down a

� I saw it mysel

ou think? He rec
eived his sight!
 It’s a sin t
o speak so. God 
"will punish you,"
” she said adm
"onishingly, turn"

  “How did th
e star get into 
the icon?” Pie
rre asked.  �
�And was the Hol

d Prince Andrew
", with a smile."
  Pelagéya sud
denly grew quite
 pale and claspe
d her hands.  
"“Oh, master, m"
"aster, what a si"

", what does it m"
ean?...” she a
"sked, turning to"
 Princess Mary.
" She got up and,"
" almost crying, "
began to arrange
 her wallet. She
 evidently felt
 frightened and 
ashamed to have 
accepted charity
 in a house whe
re such things c
"ould be said, an"
d was at the sam
e time sorry to 
 have now to for
go the charity o
f this house.  
"
“Now, why nee"

said Princess Ma
ry. “Why did y
ou come to me?.
..”  “Come
", Pelagéya, I w"
"as joking,” sa"
id Pierre. “Pr
"incesse, ma

ot mean anything

I was only jo"

" * “Princess, "
"on my word, I di"
d not wish to of

 Pelagéya stop
"ped doubtfully, "
but in Pierre’
s face there was
 such a look of
 sincere peniten
"ce, and Prince A"
ndrew glanced so
 meekly now at 
her and now at P
"ierre, that she "
was gradually re
assured.    
  CHAPTER XIV 
  The pilgrim w
oman was appease
"d and, being enc"
"ouraged to talk,"
 gave a long ac
count of Father 
"Amphilochus, who"
 led so holy a l
ife that his ha
nds smelled of i
"ncense, and how "
on her last visi
t to Kiev some m
onks she knew l
et her have the 
keys of the cata
"combs, and how s"
"he, taking
some"
 dried bread wit
"h her, had spent"
 two days in the
 catacombs with 
 the saints. “
I’d pray awhil
"e to one, ponder"
" awhile, then go"
 on to another.
 I’d sleep a b
it and then agai
n go and kiss th
"e relics, and
t"
here was such pe
"ace all around, "
such blessedness
", that one don�"
�t want to come
" out, even into "
the light of hea
ven again.”  
 Pierre listened
 to her attentiv
ely and seriousl
y. Prince Andrew
 went out of th
"e room, and then"
", leaving “God"
’s folk” to 
finish their tea
",
Princess Mary"
 took Pierre int
o the drawing ro
om.  “You ar
"e very kind,” "
she said to him.
"

“Oh, I rea"
lly did not mean
 to hurt her fee
lings. I underst
and them so wel
l and have the g
reatest respect 
for them.”  
Princess Mary lo
oked at him sile
ntly and smiled 
affectionately. 
  “I have kno
wn you a long ti
"me, you see, and"
 am as fond of y
ou as of a brot
"her,” she said"
. “How do you 
find Andrew?” 
she added hurrie
"dly,
not giving"
 him time to rep
ly to her affect
ionate words. �
�I am very anxi
ous about him. H
is health was be
tter in the wint
"er, but last spr"
ing his wound r
eopened and the 
doctor said he o
ught to go away 
for a cure. And
 I am also very 
much afraid for 
him spiritually.
 He has not a c
haracter like us
" women who, when"
" we suffer, can "
weep away our so
rrows. He keeps
 it all within h
im. Today he is 
cheerful and in 
"good spirits,
b"
ut that is the e
ffect of your vi
sit—he is not 
often like that.
 If you could p
ersuade him to g
o abroad. He nee

 this quiet reg
ular life is ver
y bad for him. O

", noticing Pierr"
e as he got out 
 of the carriage
.  “Ah! Very
" glad! Kiss me,�"
"�� he said, havi"

him dis"
puting hotly wit

ierre was mainta
ining that a tim

The old prince d
isputed it chaf
"fingly, but with"
out getting angr

put in water ins
"tead, then
ther"

"epeated, but sti"

looking over the

like an old frie

"Princess

who had been won
 by his gentlene

er most radiant
" looks, but even"
 the one-year-ol

 and Michael Iv�

ne looked at hi

smiles when he t
alked to the old

in to supper; th
is was evidently
 on Pierre’s

     CHAPTE
R XV  When ret
urning from his 
"leave, Rostóv f"
"elt, for the fir"
"st time, how
cl"
ose was the bond
 that united him
 to Denísov and
 the whole regim
ent.  On appro
"aching it, Rost�"
�v felt as he ha
d done when appr
oaching his home
 in Moscow. Whe
n he saw the fir
st hussar with t
he unbuttoned un
iform of his re
"giment, when he "
recognized red-h
aired Deméntyev
 and saw the pi
cket ropes of th
"e roan horses, w"
hen Lavrúshka g
leefully shouted
" to
his master,"
 “The count ha
s come!” and D
"enísov, who had"
 been asleep on
" his bed, ran al"
l disheveled out
 of the mud hut 
"to embrace him,"
 and the officer
s collected roun
d to greet the n
"ew arrival, Rost"
óv experienced
 the same feelin
g as when his mo
"ther, his father"
", and his
siste"
r had embraced h
"im, and tears of"
 joy choked him 
so that he could
 not speak. The
 regiment was al
"so a home, and a"
s unalterably de
ar and precious
 as his parents�
�� house.  Whe
n he had reporte
d himself to the
 commander of th
e regiment and h
ad been reassig
ned to his forme
"r squadron, had "
been on duty and
 had gone out f
"oraging, when he"
 had again enter
ed into all the 
little interests
 of the regimen
t and felt himse
lf deprived of l
iberty and bound
" in one
narrow,"
 unchanging fram
"e, he experience"
d the same sense
" of peace, of
m"
"oral support, an"
d the same sense
 of being at hom
e here in his ow
"n
place, as he "
had felt under t
he parental roof
. But here was n
one of all that
 turmoil of the 
"world at large, "
where he did not
 know his right 
 place and took 
mistaken decisio
ns; here was no 
Sónya with whom
" he
ought, or o"
"ught not, to hav"
e an explanation
; here was no po
ssibility of go
ing there or not
 going there; he
re there were no
t twenty-four ho
urs in the day 
which could be s
pent in such a v
ariety of ways; 
there was not t
hat innumerable 
crowd of people 
of whom not one 
was nearer to hi
m or farther fr
om him than anot
her; there were 
none of those un
certain and und
efined money rel
ations with his 
"father, and noth"
ing to recall th
at terrible los
s to Dólokhov. 
"Here, in the reg"
"iment, all was c"
lear and simple
. The whole worl
d was divided in
to two unequal p
"arts: one, our
"
Pávlograd regim
"ent; the other, "
all the rest. An
d the rest was n
o concern of hi
s. In the regime
"nt, everything w"
as definite: who
 was lieutenant
", who captain, w"
ho was a good fe
"llow, who a bad "
"one, and most
o"
"f all, who was a"
 comrade. The ca
nteenkeeper gave
" one credit, one"
’s pay came e
very four months
", there was noth"
ing to think out
" or decide,
you"
 had only to do 
nothing that was
 considered bad 
in the Pávlogra
"d
regiment and,"
 when given an o
"rder, to do what"
" was clearly, di"
"stinctly,
and d"
efinitely ordere
d—and all woul
d be well.  Ha
ving once more e
ntered into the 
definite conditi
ons of this regi
"mental
life, Ro"
stóv felt the j
oy and relief a 
tired man feels 
on lying down to
 rest. Life in 
"the regiment, du"
ring this campai
"gn, was all the "
pleasanter for 
"him, because, af"
ter his loss to 
Dólokhov (for w
"hich, in spite
"
of all his famil
y’s efforts to
" console him, he"
 could not forgi
"ve
himself), he"
 had made up his
 mind to atone f
or his fault by 
"serving,
not as"
 he had done bef
"ore, but really "
"well, and by bei"
ng a perfectly 
first-rate comra
de and officer�
"�in a word, a sp"
lendid man altog
"ether, a
thing "
which seemed so 
difficult out in
" the world, but "
so possible in t
he regiment.  
 After his losse
"s, he had determ"
ined to pay back
 his debt to his
 parents in fiv
e years. He rece
ived ten thousan
"d rubles a year,"
 but now resolve
d to take only 
two thousand and
 leave the rest 
to repay the deb
t to his parent
"s.

Our army, "
after repeated r
etreats and adva
nces and battles
 at Pultúsk an
d Preussisch-Eyl
"au, was concentr"
ated near Barten
stein. It was aw
aiting the Empe
ror’s arrival 
and the beginnin
g of a new campa
ign.  The Páv
"lograd regiment,"
 belonging to th
at part of the a
rmy which had s
erved in the 180
"5 campaign, had "
been recruiting 
up to strength i
"n
Russia, and a"
rrived too late 
to take part in 
the first action
s of the campai
gn. It had been 
neither at Pult�
�sk nor at Preus
"sisch-Eylau and,"
 when it joined
 the army in the
 field in the se
cond half of the
" campaign,
was "
attached to Plá
tov’s division
.  Plátov’s
 division was ac
ting independent
ly of the main a
rmy. Several ti
mes parts of the
 Pávlograd regi
ment had exchang
ed shots with t
"he enemy, had ta"
"ken prisoners, a"
nd once had even
 captured Marsha
l Oudinot’s c
arriages. In Apr
il the Pávlogra
ds were statione
d immovably for
 some weeks near
 a totally ruine
d and deserted G
erman village. 
 A thaw had set
" in, it was mudd"
"y and cold, the "
ice on the river
" broke,
and the"
 roads became im
passable. For da
ys neither provi
sions for the m
en nor fodder fo
r the horses had
 been issued. As
 no transports c
"ould
arrive, th"
e men dispersed 
about the abando
ned and deserted
" villages,
sear"
ching for potato
"es, but found fe"
w even of these.
  Everything h
ad been eaten up
 and the inhabit
ants had all fle
d—if any rema
"ined, they were "
worse than begga
rs and nothing m
ore could be tak
en from them; e
ven the soldiers
", usually pitile"
"ss enough, inste"
ad of taking an
ything from them
", often gave the"
m the last of th
eir rations.  
The Pávlograd r
egiment had had 
only two men wou
"nded in action, "
but had lost ne
arly half its me
n from hunger an
d sickness. In t
"he hospitals,
d"
eath was so cert
ain that soldier
s suffering from
" fever, or the s"
welling that ca
me from bad food
", preferred to r"
"emain on duty, a"
nd hardly able 
to drag their le
gs went to the f
ront rather than
 to the hospital
s. When spring 
"came on, the sol"
diers found a pl
ant just showing
 out of the gro
und that looked 
"like asparagus, "
"which, for some "
"reason, they cal"
led “Máshka�
��s sweet root.�
�� It was very b
"itter, but they "
wandered about 
the fields seeki
ng it and dug it
 out with their 
sabers and ate i
"t,
though they "
were ordered not
" to do so, as it"
 was a noxious p
lant. That spri
ng a new disease
 broke out among
" the soldiers, a"
 swelling of the
"
arms, legs, an"
"d face, which th"
e doctors attrib
uted to eating t
his root. But i
n spite of all t
"his, the soldier"
s of Denísov’
s squadron fed 
chiefly on “M�
�shka’s sweet 
"root,” because"
 it was the seco
nd week that th
e last of the bi
scuits were bein
g doled out at t
he rate of half 
a pound a man a
nd the last pota
toes received ha
d sprouted and f
rozen.  The ho
rses also had be
en fed for a for
tnight on straw 
from the thatche
d roofs and had
 become terribly
" thin, though st"
ill covered with
 tufts of felty
 winter hair.  
 Despite this de
"stitution, the s"
oldiers and offi
cers went on liv
ing just as usu
al. Despite thei
r pale swollen f
aces and tattere
"d uniforms, the"
 hussars formed 
line for roll ca
"ll, kept things "
"in order, groome"
"d their
horses,"
 polished their 
"arms, brought in"
 straw from the 
thatched roofs i
n place of fodd
"er, and sat down"
 to dine round t
he caldrons from
 which they ros
"e up hungry, jok"
ing about their 
nasty food and t
heir hunger. As 
"
usual, in their"
" spare time, the"
"y lit bonfires, "
steamed themselv
es before them 
"naked; smoked, p"
icked out and ba
ked sprouting ro
"tten potatoes, t"
old and listene
d to stories of 
Potëmkin’s an
d Suvórov’s c
"ampaigns, or
to"
 legends of Alë
"sha the Sly, or "
the priest’s l
aborer Mikólka.
  The officers
", as usual, live"
d in twos and th
rees in the roof
"less,
half-ruin"
ed houses. The s
eniors tried to 
collect straw an
"d potatoes and,"
"
in general, foo"
d for the men. T
he younger ones 
occupied themsel
"ves as
before, "
some playing car
ds (there was pl
"enty of money, t"
hough there was 
"
no food), some "
with more innoce
"nt games, such a"
s quoits and ski
ttles. The gene
ral trend of the
 campaign was ra
"rely spoken of, "
partly because 
nothing certain 
was known about 
"it, partly becau"
se there was a v
ague feeling th
at in the main i
t was going badl
y.  Rostóv li
"ved, as before, "
"with Denísov, a"
nd since their f
urlough they ha
d become more fr
iendly than ever
. Denísov never
 spoke of Rostó
"v’s
family, b"
ut by the tender
 friendship his 
commander showed
" him, Rostóv
f"
elt that the eld
er hussar’s lu
ckless love for 
Natásha played 
a part in stren
gthening their f
riendship. Dení
sov evidently tr
ied to expose R
ostóv to danger
 as seldom as po
"ssible, and afte"
r an action gree
ted his safe re
turn with eviden
t joy. On one of
 his foraging ex
"peditions, in
a"
 deserted and ru
ined village to 
which he had com
e in search of 
"provisions, Rost"
óv found a fami
ly consisting of
 an old Pole and
 his daughter w
ith an infant in
 arms. They were
" half clad, hung"
"ry, too weak
to"
 get away on foo
t and had no mea
ns of obtaining 
a conveyance. Ro
stóv brought t
hem to his quart
"ers, placed them"
 in his own lodg
"ing, and
kept t"
hem for some wee
ks while the old
 man was recover
ing. One of his 
"
comrades, talki"
"ng of women, beg"
an chaffing Rost
"óv, saying that"
 he was more wi
ly than any of t
hem and that it 
would not be a b
ad thing if he 
introduced to th
em the pretty Po
lish girl he had
 saved. Rostóv 
took the joke a
"s an insult, fla"
"red up, and said"
 such unpleasant
 things to the 
officer that it 
was all Denísov
 could do to pre
vent a duel. Whe
n the officer h
"ad gone away, De"
"nísov, who did "
not himself know
 what Rostóv�
�s relations wit
h the Polish gir
"l might be, bega"
n to upbraid hi
m for his quickn
"ess of temper, a"
nd Rostóv repli
ed:  “Say wh
at you like.... 
She is like a si
"ster to me, and "
I can’t tell 
you how it offen
ded me... becaus
"e... well, for t"
hat reason....�
�  Denísov pa
tted him on the 
shoulder and beg
an rapidly pacin
g the room with
out looking at R
"ostóv, as was h"
is way at moment
s of deep feelin
"g.

“Ah, wha"
t a mad bweed yo
u Wostóvs are!�
"�� he muttered, "
and Rostóv not
iced tears in hi
s eyes.     
  CHAPTER XVI 
 In April the t
roops were enliv
ened by news of 
the Emperor’s 
"arrival,
but Ro"
stóv had no cha
nce of being pre
sent at the revi
ew he held at B
"artenstein, as t"
he Pávlograds w
ere at the outpo
sts far beyond t
hat place.  T
hey were bivouac
king. Denísov a
nd Rostóv were 
living in an ear
"th hut,
dug out"
 for them by the
 soldiers and ro
ofed with branch
es and turf. The
 hut was made i
n the following 
"manner, which ha"
d then come into
 vogue. A trenc
h was dug three 
and a half feet 
"wide, four feet "
eight inches dee
"p,
and eight fe"
et long. At one 
end of the trenc
"h, steps were cu"
t out and these
 formed the entr
ance and vestibu
le. The trench i
tself was the ro
"om,
in which th"
"e lucky ones, su"
ch as the squadr
"on commander, ha"
"d a board,
lyin"
g on piles at th
e end opposite t
"he entrance, to "
serve as a table
. On each side 
"of the trench, t"
he earth was cut
 out to a breadt
h of about two 
"and a half feet,"
 and this did du
ty for bedsteads
 and couches. Th
e roof was so c
onstructed that 
one could stand 
up in the middle
 of the trench 
and could even s
it up on the bed
s if one drew cl
ose to the table
".
Denísov, who"
 was living luxu
riously because 
the soldiers of 
his squadron li
"ked him, had als"
o a board in the
 roof at the far
"ther end,
with "
a piece of (brok
en but mended) g
lass in it for a
 window. When it
"
was very cold,"
 embers from the
 soldiers’ cam
pfire were place
d on a bent she
et of iron on th
e steps in the �
��reception room
”—as Denís
ov called that p
art of the hut�
�and it was then
 so warm that th
"e
officers, of "
whom there were 
always some with
 Denísov and Ro
"stóv, sat
in t"
heir shirt sleev
"es.

In April,"
 Rostóv was on 
orderly duty. On
"e morning, betwe"
en seven and ei
"ght, returning a"
fter a sleepless
" night, he sent "
"for embers, chan"
ged his rain-so
aked underclothe
"s, said his pray"
"ers, drank tea, "
"got warm,
then "
tidied up the th
ings on the tabl
e and in his own
" corner, and,
h"
is face glowing 
from exposure to
 the wind and wi
th nothing on bu
"t his
shirt, la"
y down on his ba
"ck, putting his "
arms under his h
ead. He was ple
asantly consider
ing the probabil
ity of being pro
moted in a few d
ays for his las
t reconnoitering
" expedition, and"
 was awaiting De
"nísov, who
had"
 gone out somewh
ere and with who
m he wanted a ta
lk.  Suddenly 
he heard Deníso
v shouting in a 
vibrating voice 
"behind the hut,"
 evidently much 
excited. Rostóv
 moved to the wi
ndow to see whom
 he was speakin
"g to, and saw th"
"e quartermaster,"
 Topchéenko.  
 “I ordered yo
u not to let the
m eat that Másh
ka woot stuff!�
� Denísov was 
shouting. “And
 I saw with my o
wn eyes how Laza
rchúk bwought 
some fwom the fi
elds.”  “I
 have given the 
order again and 
"again, your hono"
"r, but they don�"
"��t
obey,” an"
swered the quart
ermaster.  Ros
tóv lay down ag
ain on his bed a
nd thought compl
acently: “Let 
 him fuss and bu
"stle now, my job"
’s done and I�
��m lying down�
��capitally!” 
He could hear th
at Lavrúshka—
"that sly, bold
"
orderly of Dení
sov’s—was ta
"lking, as well a"
s the quartermas
ter. Lavrúshka
 was saying some
thing about load
"ed wagons, biscu"
"its, and oxen
h"
e had seen when 
he had gone out 
for provisions. 
  Then Denísov
’s voice was h
eard shouting fa
rther and farthe
r away. “Sadd
le! Second plato
on!”  “Whe
re are they off 
to now?” thoug
ht Rostóv.  F
ive minutes late
"r, Denísov came"
" into the hut, c"
limbed with mudd
y boots on the 
"bed, lit his pip"
"e, furiously sca"
ttered his thing
"s about, took
h"
"is leaded whip, "
buckled on his s
"aber, and went o"
ut again. In ans
wer to Rostóv�
��s inquiry wher
"e he was going, "
he answered vagu
ely and crossly 
 that he had som
e business.  �
��Let God and ou
r gweat monarch 
judge me afterwa
rds!” said Den
ísov going out
", and Rostóv he"
ard the hoofs of
 several horses 
splashing throu
gh the mud. He d
id not even trou
ble to find out 
where Denísov h
ad gone. Having
 got warm in his
" corner, he fell"
 asleep and did 
not leave the h
ut till toward e
vening. Denísov
 had not yet ret
urned. The weath
er had cleared 
"up, and near the"
 next hut two of
ficers and a cad
et were playing
" sváyka, laughi"
ng as they threw
 their missiles 
which buried th
emselves in the 
soft mud. Rostó
v joined them. I
n the middle of 
"the
game, the o"
fficers saw some
 wagons approach
ing with fifteen
 hussars on the
ir skinny horses
 behind them. Th
e wagons escorte
d by the hussars
 drew up to the
 picket ropes an
d a crowd of hus
sars surrounded 
them.  “Ther
"e now, Denísov "
has been worryin
"g,” said Rost�"
"�v, “and here"
 are the provisi
ons.”  “So
 they are!” sa
id the officers.
 “Won’t the 
soldiers be gla
d!”  A littl
e behind the hus
sars came Denís
"ov, accompanied "
by two infantry 
 officers with w
hom he was talki
ng.  Rostóv w
ent to meet them
.  “I warn y
"ou, Captain,” "
one of the offic
"ers, a short thi"
"n man,
evidentl"
"y very angry, wa"
s saying.  “
Haven’t I told
 you I won’t g
ive them up?” 
replied Denísov
.  “You will
" answer for it, "
Captain. It is m
utiny—seizing 
the transport o
f one’s own ar
my. Our men have
 had nothing to 
eat for two days
.”  “And m
ine have had not
hing for two wee
"ks,” said Den�"
�sov.  “It i
s robbery! You�
�ll answer for i
"t, sir!” said "
the infantry of
"ficer, raising h"
is voice.  “
"Now, what are yo"
u pestewing me f
or?” cried Den
"ísov, suddenly"
 losing his temp
er. “I shall a
nswer for it and
" not you, and yo"
u’d better no
t buzz about her
e till you get h
urt. Be off! Go!
” he shouted 
at the officers.
  “Very well
", then!” shout"
ed the little of
"ficer, undaunted"
 and not riding
 away. “If you
 are determined 
"to rob, I’ll.."
.”  “Go to
 the devil! quic
"k ma’ch, while"
 you’re safe a
nd sound!” and
 Denísov turne
d his horse on t
he officer.  �
"��Very well, ver"
y well!” mutte
"red the officer,"
" threateningly, "
and turning his
 horse he trotte
"d away, jolting "
in his saddle. 
 “A dog astwi
de a fence! A we
al dog astwide a
 fence!” shout
ed Denísov aft
er him (the most
 insulting expre
ssion a cavalrym
an can address 
to a mounted inf
antryman) and ri
ding up to Rost�
"�v, he burst out"
 laughing.  �
��I’ve taken t
wansports from t
he infantwy by f
orce!” he said
".
“After all,"
 can’t let our
 men starve.” 
  The wagons th
at had reached t
he hussars had b
een consigned to
 an infantry re
"giment, but lear"
ning from Lavrú
shka that the tr
ansport was une
"scorted, Deníso"
v with his hussa
rs had seized it
 by force. The 
soldiers had bis
cuits dealt out 
"to them freely, "
and they even sh
ared them with 
the other squadr
ons.  The next
 day the regimen
tal commander se
"nt for Denísov,"
 and holding his
 fingers spread
 out before his 
eyes said:  �
�This is how I l
ook at this affa
ir: I know nothi
ng about it and 
 won’t begin p
"roceedings, but "
I advise you to 
ride over to the
 staff and sett
le the business 
there in the com
missariat depart
ment and if pos
sible sign a rec
eipt for such an
d such stores re
"ceived. If not, "
as the demand w
as booked agains
t an infantry re
"giment, there wi"
ll be a row and
 the affair may 
end badly.”  
 From the regime
ntal commander�
"�s, Denísov rod"
e straight to th
e staff with a 
sincere desire t
o act on this ad
vice. In the eve
ning he came ba
ck to his dugout
 in a state such
 as Rostóv had 
never yet seen h
im in. Denísov
 could not speak
 and gasped for 
breath. When Ros
tóv asked what 
"
was the matter,"
 he only uttered
 some incoherent
 oaths and threa
"ts in a
hoarse,"
 feeble voice. 
 Alarmed at Den
ísov’s condit
"ion, Rostóv sug"
gested that he s
"hould
undress, "
drink some water
", and send for t"
he doctor.  �
�Twy me for wobb
ewy... oh! Some 
more water... Le
"t them twy me, b"
ut I’ll alway
s thwash scoundw
els... and I’l
l tell the Empew
o’... Ice...�
�� he muttered. 
  The regimenta
"l doctor, when h"
"e came, said it "
was absolutely n
ecessary to ble
ed Denísov. A d
eep saucer of bl
ack blood was ta
ken from his hai
ry arm and only
 then was he abl
e to relate what
 had happened to
 him.  “I ge
"t there,” bega"
n Denísov. “�
"��Now then, wher"
e’s your chie
f’s quarters?�
�� They were poi

"� Vewy well, so "
out comes their

so took it into 
his head to lect

"�‘Wobbewy,’ "
"I say, ‘is not"

 him who takes t

 ‘Will you ple

� ‘Vewy good!�
�� Then he says
: ‘Go and give
 a weceipt to th
"e commissioner, "
but your affair 
 will be passed 
on to headquarte
rs.’ I go to t
he commissioner.
" I enter,
and a"
t the table... w
ho do you think?
" No, but wait a "
bit!... Who is i
t that’s star
ving us?” shou
"ted Denísov, hi"
tting the table 
with the fist o
f his newly bled
 arm so violentl
y that the table
 nearly broke do
wn and the tumb
lers on it jumpe
d about. “Tely
ánin! ‘What? 
So it’s you w
ho’s starving 
us to death! Is 
it? Take this an
d this!’ and I
 hit him so pat
", stwaight on hi"
s snout... ‘Ah
", what a... what"
 a...!’ and I
 sta’ted fwash
"ing him... Well,"
 I’ve had a bi
t of fun I can t
ell you!” cri
"ed Denísov, gle"
eful and yet ang
"ry, his white te"
eth showing und
er his black mus
tache. “I’d 
have killed him 
if they hadn’t
 taken him away
!”  “But w
hat are you shou
ting for? Calm y
"ourself,” said"
 Rostóv. “Yo
u’ve set your 
arm bleeding afr
"esh. Wait, we mu"
st tie it up ag
ain.”  Dení
sov was bandaged
 up again and pu
t to bed. Next d
ay he woke calm 
and cheerful. 
 But at noon th
e adjutant of th
e regiment came 
into Rostóv’s
 and Denísov�
�s dugout with a
 grave and serio
us face and regr
etfully showed 
them a paper add
ressed to Major 
Denísov from th
e regimental com
mander in which
 inquiries were 
made about yeste
rday’s occurre
nce. The adjuta
nt told them tha
t the affair was
 likely to take 
a very bad turn
: that a court-m
artial had been 
"appointed, and t"
hat in view of t
he severity wit
h which maraudin
g and insubordin
ation were now r
"egarded,
degrad"
ation to the ran
ks would be the 
best that could 
be hoped for.  
"
The case, as re"
presented by the
 offended partie
"s, was that, aft"
er seizing the 
"transports, Majo"
"r Denísov, bein"
"g drunk, went to"
 the chief quar
termaster and wi
thout any provoc
ation called him
" a thief, threat"
ened to strike 
"him, and on bein"
g led out had ru
shed into the of
fice and given 
two officials a 
"thrashing, and d"
islocated the ar
m of one of them
.  In answer t
o Rostóv’s re
"newed questions,"
" Denísov said, "
"laughing,
that "
he thought he re
membered that so
me other fellow 
had got mixed up
"
in it, but tha"
t it was all non
sense and rubbis
"h, and he did no"
t in the least 
fear any kind of
" trial, and that"
 if those scound
rels dared attac
k him he would 
give them an ans
wer that they wo
uld not easily f
orget.  Denís
ov spoke contemp
tuously of the w
"hole matter, but"
 Rostóv knew hi
m too well not 
to detect that (
while hiding it 
from others) at 
heart he feared
 a court-martial
 and was worried
 over the affair
", which was
evi"
dently taking a 
bad turn. Every 
"day, letters of "
inquiry and noti
ces from the co
"urt arrived, and"
 on the first of
" May, Denísov w"
as ordered to h
and the squadron
 over to the nex
t in seniority a
nd appear before
 the staff of h
is division to e
xplain his viole
nce at the commi
ssariat office.
 On the previous
 day Plátov rec
onnoitered with 
two Cossack reg
iments and two s
quadrons of huss
"ars. Denísov, a"
"s was his wont, "
rode out in fro
nt of the outpos
"ts, parading his"
 courage. A bull
et fired by a F
rench sharpshoot
er hit him in th
e fleshy part of
 his leg. Perhap
s at another ti
me Denísov woul
d not have left 
the regiment for
 so slight a wo
"und, but now he "
took advantage o
f it to excuse h
imself from appe
aring at the st
aff and went int
o hospital.   
    CHAPTER X
VII  In June t
he battle of Fri
edland was fough
"t, in which the "
Pávlograds did 
"
not take part, "
and after that a
n armistice was 
proclaimed. Rost
"óv, who
felt h"
is friend’s ab
"sence very much,"
 having no news 
of him since he 
 left and feelin
g very anxious a
bout his wound a
nd the progress 
"of his
affairs,"
 took advantage 
of the armistice
 to get leave to
 visit Denísov 
 in hospital.  
 The hospital wa
s in a small Pru
ssian town that 
had been twice d
evastated by Ru
ssian and French
 troops. Because
" it was summer, "
when it is so b
eautiful out in 
"the fields, the "
little town pres
ented a particul
arly dismal app
earance with its
 broken roofs an
"d fences, its fo"
"ul streets,
tat"
tered inhabitant
"s, and the sick "
and drunken sold
iers wandering a
bout.  The hos
pital was in a b
rick building wi
th some of the w
indow frames and
 panes broken a
nd a courtyard s
urrounded by the
 remains of a wo
oden fence that
 had been pulled
 to pieces. Seve
ral bandaged sol
"diers, with pale"
"
swollen faces,"
 were sitting or
 walking about i
n the sunshine i
n the yard.  
Directly Rostóv
 entered the doo
r he was envelop
ed by a smell of
 putrefaction a
nd hospital air.
 On the stairs h
e met a Russian 
army doctor smo
king a cigar. Th
e doctor was fol
lowed by a Russi
an assistant.  
 “I can’t te
ar myself to pie
"ces,” the doct"
or was saying. �
��Come to Maká
r Alexéevich in
 the evening. I 
shall be there.�
��  The assist
ant asked some f
urther questions
".

“Oh, do t"
he best you can!
 Isn’t it all 
the same?” The
 doctor noticed
 Rostóv coming 
upstairs.  “
What do you want
", sir?” said t"
he doctor. “Wh
at do you want? 
 The bullets hav
"ing spared you, "
do you want to t
ry typhus? This 
"is a
pesthouse,"
 sir.”  “H
ow so?” asked 
Rostóv.  “T
"yphus, sir. It�"
�s death to go i
"n. Only we two, "
Makéev and I”
 (he pointed to
" the assistant),"
 “keep on here
. Some five of u
s doctors have 
died in this pla
ce.... When a ne
w one comes he i
s done for in a 
"week,”
said t"
he doctor with e
vident satisfact
ion. “Prussian
 doctors have be
en invited here
", but our allies"
 don’t like it
 at all.”  R
ostóv explained
 that he wanted 
to see Major Den
ísov of the hus
"sars,
who was w"
ounded.  “I 
don’t know. I 
can’t tell you
", sir. Only thin"
k! I am alone in
 charge of thre
e hospitals with
 more than four 
hundred patients
! It’s well t
hat the charitab
le Prussian ladi
es send us two p
ounds of coffee 
 and some lint e
ach month or we 
should be lost!�
�� he laughed. �
"��Four
hundred,"
" sir, and they�"
�re always sendi
ng me fresh ones
. There are four
 hundred? Eh?�
"� he asked, turn"
ing to the assis
tant.  The ass
istant looked fa
gged out. He was
 evidently vexed
 and impatient 
for the talkativ
e doctor to go. 
  “Major Den�
"�sov,” Rostóv"
 said again. “
He was wounded a
t Molliten.” 
"

“Dead, I fa"
"ncy. Eh, Makéev"
?” queried the
" doctor, in a to"
ne of indiffere
nce.  The assi
"stant, however, "
did not confirm 
the doctor’s w
ords.  “Is h
e tall and with 
reddish hair?”
 asked the docto
r.  Rostóv de
scribed Denísov
’s appearance.
  “There was
" one like that,�"
�� said the doct
"or, as if please"
d. “That one 
"is dead, I fancy"
". However, I’l"
l look up our li
st. We had a lis
t. Have you got
" it, Makéev?”"
  “Makár Al
exéevich has th
"e list,” answe"
red the assistan
t. “But if yo
u’ll step into
 the officers’
 wards you’ll 
see for yourself
",”
he added, "
turning to Rost�
"�v.

“Ah, yo"
u’d better not
" go, sir,” sai"
"d the doctor, �"
�or you may hav
e to stay here y
ourself.”  B
ut Rostóv bowed
 himself away fr
om the doctor an
d asked the assi
stant to show h
im the way.  �
��Only don’t b
lame me!” the 
doctor shouted u
p after him.  
Rostóv and the 
assistant went i
nto the dark cor
ridor. The smell
 was so strong 
there that Rost�
�v held his nose
 and had to paus
e and collect h
is strength befo
re he could go o
n. A door opened
" to the right, a"
nd an emaciated
 sallow man on c
"rutches, barefoo"
t and in undercl
"othing, limped
"
"out and, leaning"
 against the doo
"rpost, looked wi"
th glittering en
vious eyes at t
hose who were pa
ssing. Glancing 
"in at the door, "
Rostóv saw tha
t the sick and w
ounded were lyin
g on the floor o
n straw and ove
rcoats.  “Ma
y I go in and lo
ok?”  “Wha
t is there to se
e?” said the a
ssistant.  But
", just because t"
he assistant evi
dently did not w
ant him to go in
",
Rostóv enter"
ed the soldiers�
�� ward. The fou
"l air, to which "
he had already 
begun to get use
d in the corrido
"r, was still str"
onger here. It 
was a little dif
"ferent, more pun"
"gent, and one fe"
lt that this was
 where it origi
nated.  In the
" long room, brig"
htly lit up by t
he sun through t
he large windows
",
the sick and "
wounded lay in t
wo rows with the
ir heads to the 
"walls, and
leav"
ing a passage in
 the middle. Mos
t of them were u
nconscious and 
paid no attentio
n to the newcome
rs. Those who we
re conscious rai
sed themselves 
or lifted their 
thin yellow face
"s, and all looke"
d intently at R
ostóv with the 
same expression 
"of hope, of reli"
"ef, reproach, an"
d envy of anoth
er’s health. R
ostóv went to t
he middle of the
 room and looki
ng through the o
pen doors into t
he two adjoining
 rooms saw the s
ame thing there
. He stood still
", looking silent"
ly around. He ha
d not at all ex
pected such a si
ght. Just before
" him, almost acr"
oss the middle o
f the passage o
n the bare floor
", lay a sick man"
", probably a Cos"
sack to judge b
y the cut of his
 hair. The man l
"ay on his back, "
his huge arms an
d legs outstret
ched. His face w
"as purple, his e"
yes were rolled 
back so that on
ly the whites we
"re seen, and on "
his bare legs an
d arms which wer
"e
still red, th"
e veins stood ou
t like cords. He
 was knocking th
e back of his h
ead against the 
"floor, hoarsely "
uttering some wo
rd which he kept
 repeating. Ros
tóv listened an
d made out the w
ord. It was “d
"rink,
drink, a "
drink!” Rostó
"v glanced round,"
 looking for som
eone who would 
put this man bac
k in his place a
nd bring him wat
er.  “Who lo
oks after the si
ck here?” he a
sked the assista
nt.  Just then
 a commissariat 
"soldier, a hospi"
"tal orderly, cam"
e in from the n
"ext room, marchi"
"ng stiffly, and "
drew up in front
 of Rostóv.  
"“Good day, you"
r honor!” he s
"houted, rolling "
his eyes at Rost
óv and evident
ly mistaking him
 for one of the 
hospital authori
ties.  “Get 
him to his place
 and give him so
"me water,” sai"
"d Rostóv,
poin"
ting to the Coss
"ack.

“Yes, "
"your honor,” t"
he soldier repli
"ed complacently,"
 and rolling hi
s eyes more than
 ever he drew hi
mself up still s
"traighter, but d"
id not move.  
"
“No, it’s i"
mpossible to do 
"anything here,�"
� thought Rostó
"v,
lowering his"
" eyes, and he wa"
"s going out, but"
 became aware of
 an intense loo
k fixed on him o
"n his right, and"
 he turned. Clos
"e to the corner,"
 on an overcoat
", sat an old, un"
"shaven, gray-bea"
rded soldier as 
thin as a skele
"ton, with a ster"
n sallow face an
d eyes intently 
fixed on Rostóv
. The man’s n
eighbor on one s
ide whispered so
"mething to him, "
pointing at Ros
"tóv, who notice"
d that the old m
an wanted to spe
ak to him. He dr
ew nearer and s
aw that the old 
man had only one
 leg bent under 
"him, the
other "
had been amputat
ed above the kne
e. His neighbor 
on the other sid
"e,
who lay moti"
onless some dist
ance from him wi
th his head thro
"wn back, was
a "
young soldier wi
th a snub nose. 
His pale waxen f
ace was still fr
eckled and his 
eyes were rolled
 back. Rostóv l
ooked at the you
ng soldier and a
 cold chill ran
 down his back. 
"

“Why, this "
one seems...” 
"he began, turnin"
g to the assista
nt.  “And ho
w we’ve been b
"egging, your hon"
"or,” said the "
"old soldier,
hi"
s jaw quivering.
 “He’s been 
dead since morni
ng. After all we
"’re
men, not "
dogs.”  “I
’ll send someo
ne at once. He s
hall be taken aw
ay—taken away 
"at
once,” sai"
d the assistant 
hurriedly. “Le
"t us go, your ho"
nor.”  “Ye
"s, yes, let us g"
"o,” said Rost�"
"�v hastily, and "
lowering his ey
es and shrinking
", he tried to pa"
ss unnoticed bet
ween the rows of
 reproachful en
vious eyes that 
were fixed upon 
"him, and went ou"
t of the room. 
      CHAPT
ER XVIII  Goin
g along the corr
"idor, the assist"
ant led Rostóv 
to the officers�
"��
wards, consi"
sting of three r
"ooms, the doors "
of which stood o
pen. There were
 beds in these r
ooms and the sic
k and wounded of
ficers were lyin
g or sitting on
 them. Some were
 walking about t
he rooms in hosp
ital dressing g
owns. The first 
person Rostóv m
et in the office
rs’ ward was a
 thin little ma
"n with one arm, "
who was walking 
about the first 
room in a night
cap and hospital
" dressing gown, "
with a pipe betw
een his teeth. 
Rostóv looked a
"t him, trying to"
 remember where 
he had seen him 
before.  “Se
e where we’ve 
met again!” sa
id the little ma
"n. “Túshin,
"
"Túshin, don’t"
" you remember, w"
ho gave you a li
ft at Schön Gra
bern? And I’v
e had a bit cut 
"off, you see...�"
�� he went on wi
"th a smile,
poi"
nting to the emp
ty sleeve of his
 dressing gown. 
“Looking for 
Vasíli Dmítric
h Denísov? My n
"eighbor,” he a"
"dded, when he he"
ard who Rostóv
 wanted. “Here
", here,” and T"
úshin led him i
nto the next ro
"om, from whence "
came sounds of s
everal laughing 
voices.  “Ho
w can they laugh
", or even live a"
t all here?” t
"hought Rostóv,"
 still aware of 
that smell of de
composing flesh 
that had been so
 strong in the 
soldiers’ ward
", and still seem"
ing to see fixed
 on him those e
nvious looks whi
ch had followed 
him out from bot
"h sides, and the"
 face of that y
oung soldier wit
h eyes rolled ba
ck.  Denísov 
lay asleep on hi
s bed with his h
ead under the bl
"anket, though
i"
t was nearly noo
"n.

“Ah, Wos"
tóv? How are yo
"u, how are you?�"
�� he called out
", still in the
"
same voice as in
" the regiment, b"
ut Rostóv notic
ed sadly that un
der this habitu
al ease and anim
"ation some new, "
"sinister, hidden"
 feeling showed 
 itself in the e
xpression of Den
ísov’s face a
nd the intonatio
ns of his voice
".

His wound, "
though a slight 
"one, had not yet"
 healed even now
", six weeks
aft"
er he had been h
it. His face had
 the same swolle
n pallor as the 
faces of the ot
her hospital pat
"ients, but it wa"
s not this that 
struck Rostóv. 
 What struck him
 was that Denís
ov did not seem 
"glad to see him,"
 and smiled at 
him unnaturally.
 He did not ask 
about the regime
"nt, nor about
t"
he general state
" of affairs, and"
 when Rostóv sp
oke of these mat
ters did not li
sten.  Rostóv
 even noticed th
at Denísov did 
not like to be r
eminded of the 
"regiment, or in "
general of that 
other free life 
which was going 
on outside the 
hospital. He see
med to try to fo
rget that old li
fe and was only
 interested in t
he affair with t
he commissariat 
officers. On Ro
stóv’s inquir
y as to how the 
"matter stood, he"
 at once produce
d from under hi
s pillow a paper
 he had received
 from the commis
sion and the ro
ugh draft of his
 answer to it. H
e became animate
d when he began 
 reading his pap
er and specially
 drew Rostóv’
s attention to t
he stinging rej
oinders he made 
to his enemies. 
His hospital com
"panions,
who ha"
d gathered round
 Rostóv—a fre
sh arrival from 
the world outsi
de—gradually b
egan to disperse
 as soon as Den�
�sov began readi
ng his answer. 
Rostóv noticed 
by their faces t
hat all those ge
ntlemen had alr
eady heard that 
story more than 
once and were ti
red of it. Only 
the man who had
" the next bed, a"
" stout Uhlan, co"
ntinued to sit o
"n his bed,
gloo"
mily frowning an
d smoking a pipe
", and little one"
-armed Túshin s
"till
listened, "
shaking his head
 disapprovingly.
 In the middle o
"f the reading,
"
the Uhlan interr
upted Denísov. 
  “But what I
" say is,” he s"
"aid, turning to "
"Rostóv, “it w"
ould be best si
mply to petition
 the Emperor for
 pardon. They sa
y great rewards 
 will now be dis
"tributed, and su"
rely a pardon wo
uld be granted..
..”  “Me p
etition the Empe
wo’!” exclai
"med Denísov, in"
 a voice to whic
h he tried hard
 to give the old
 energy and fire
", but which soun"
ded like an exp
ression of irrit
able impotence. 
“What for? If 
I were a wobber 
I would ask mer
"cy, but I’m be"
ing court-martia
led for bwinging
 wobbers to boo
k. Let them twy 
"me, I’m not af"
waid of anyone. 
I’ve served t

ountwy honowably
 and have not st

o be degwaded?.
".. Listen, I’m"
 w’iting to th
em stwaight. Thi
s is what I say
: ‘If I had wo
bbed the Tweasuw
y...’”  �
�It’s certainl
"y well written,�"
"�� said Túshin,"
 “but that’s
" not
the point,"
 Vasíli Dmítri
"ch,” and he al"
so turned to Ros
tóv. “One ha
"s to submit, and"
 Vasíli Dmítri
ch doesn’t wan
t to. You know t
he auditor told
 you it was a ba
d business.” 
"
“Well, let i"
"t be bad,” sai"
d Denísov.  �
��The auditor wr
ote out a petiti
"on for you,” c"
ontinued Túshin
",
“and you ou"
ght to sign it a
nd ask this gent
leman to take it
. No doubt he�
� (indicating Ro
stóv) “has co
nnections on the
 staff. You won�
��t find a bett
er opportunity.�
��  “Haven�
�t I said I’m 
not going to gwo
vel?” Denísov
 interrupted hi
"m, went on readi"
ng his paper.  
 Rostóv had not
 the courage to 
persuade Deníso
"v, though he
in"
stinctively felt
 that the way ad
vised by Túshin
 and the other 
officers was the
" safest, and tho"
ugh he would hav
e been glad to b
e of service to
 Denísov. He kn
ew his stubborn 
will and straigh
tforward hasty 
temper.  When 
the reading of D
enísov’s viru
"lent reply, whic"
h took more than
" an
hour, was o"
"ver, Rostóv sai"
"d nothing, and h"
e spent the rest
 of the day in 
a most dejected 
state of mind am
id Denísov’s 
hospital comrade
"s,
who had gath"
"ered round him, "
telling them wha
t he knew and li
stening to thei
r stories. Dení
sov was moodily 
silent all the e
vening.  Late 
"in the evening, "
when Rostóv was
" about to leave,"
 he asked Denís
ov whether he h
ad no commission
 for him.  “
"Yes, wait a bit,"
” said Deníso
"v, glancing roun"
d at the officer
"s,
and taking h"
is papers from u
nder his pillow 
he went to the w
"indow, where
he"
" had an inkpot, "
and sat down to 
write.  “It 
seems it’s no 
use knocking one
’s head agains
t a wall!” he 
"
said, coming fr"
om the window an
d giving Rostóv
 a large envelop
e. In it was th
e petition to th
e Emperor drawn 
up by the audito
"r, in
which Den"
"ísov, without a"
lluding to the o
ffenses of the c
ommissariat off
"icials, simply a"
sked for pardon.
  “Hand it i
n. It seems...�
�  He did not 
"finish, but gave"
 a painfully unn
atural smile.  
     CHAPTER
 XIX  Having r
eturned to the r
egiment and told
 the commander t
he state of Den
ísov’s affair
"s, Rostóv rode "
to Tilsit with t

 Emperor.  On
 the thirteenth 
of June the Fren

mperors arrived 
in Tilsit. Bor�

", had always cal"
led Buonaparte. 
  “You are sp
eaking of Buonap
arte?” asked t
"he general, smil"
ing.  Borís l
ooked at his gen
eral inquiringly
 and immediately
 saw that he was
 being tested. 
  “I am speak
"ing, Prince, of "
the Emperor Napo
"leon,” he repl"
ied. The genera
l patted him on 
"the shoulder, wi"
th a smile.  �
��You will go fa
"r,” he said, a"
nd took him to T
ilsit with him. 
  Borís was am
ong the few pres
ent at the Nieme
n on the day the
 two Emperors m
et. He saw the r
"aft, decorated w"
"ith monograms, s"
aw Napoleon pas
s before the Fre
nch Guards on th
e farther bank o
"f the river, saw"
 the pensive fa
ce of the Empero
r Alexander as h
e sat in silence
 in a tavern on
 the bank of the
 Niemen awaiting
 Napoleon’s ar
"rival, saw both"
 Emperors get in
"to boats, and sa"
w how Napoleon�
�reaching the ra
ft first—step
ped quickly forw
ard to meet Alex
ander and held o
ut his hand to 
"him, and how the"
y both retired i
nto the pavilion
. Since he had b
egun to move in
 the highest cir
cles Borís had 
made it his habi
t to watch atte
ntively all that
 went on around 
him and to note 
it down. At the 
time of the mee
ting at Tilsit h
e asked the name
s of those who h
ad come with Na
poleon and about
 the uniforms th
"ey wore, and lis"
tened attentivel
y to words spok
en by important 
personages. At t
he moment the Em
perors went int
o the pavilion h
e looked at his 
"watch, and did n"
ot forget to loo
k at it again w
hen Alexander ca
me out. The inte
rview had lasted
 an hour and fi
fty-three minute
s. He noted this
 down that same 
"evening, among o"
ther facts he f
elt to be of his
toric importance
. As the Emperor
’s suite was 
a very small one
", it was a matte"
r of great impor
"tance, for a man"
 who valued his
 success in the 
"service, to be a"
t Tilsit on the 
occasion of thi
s interview betw
een the two Empe
"rors, and having"
 succeeded in th
"is,
Borís felt"
 that henceforth
 his position wa
s fully assured.
 He had not onl
"y become known, "
but people had g
rown accustomed 
to him and accep
ted him. Twice 
he had executed 
commissions to t
he Emperor himse
"lf, so
that the"
 latter knew his
" face, and all t"
"hose at court, f"
ar from cold-sh
ouldering him as
 at first when t
hey considered h
"im a newcomer,
"
would now have b
een surprised ha
d he been absent
.  Borís lodg
ed with another 
"adjutant, the Po"
lish Count Zhil�
�nski. Zhilíns
"ki, a Pole broug"
"ht up in Paris, "
"was rich, and pa"
ssionately fond
" of the French, "
and almost every
 day of the stay
" at Tilsit, Fren"
ch officers of 
the Guard and fr
om French headqu
arters were dini
ng and lunching
 with him and Bo
rís.  On the 
evening of the t
wenty-fourth of 
"June, Count Zhil"
ínski arranged 
a supper for hi
s French friends
. The guest of h
onor was an aide
-de-camp of Nap
"oleon’s, there"
 were also sever
al French office
"rs of the Guard,"
 and a page of 
"Napoleon’s, a "
young lad of an 
old aristocratic
 French family.
" That same day, "
"Rostóv, profiti"
ng by the darkne
ss to avoid bein
g recognized in
" civilian dress,"
 came to Tilsit 
and went to the 
lodging occupie
d by Borís and 
Zhilínski.  R
"ostóv, in commo"
n with the whole
 army from which
" he came, was fa"
r from having e
xperienced the c
hange of feeling
 toward Napoleon
 and the French
—who from bein
g foes had sudde
nly become frien
ds—that had t
aken place at he
adquarters and i
n Borís. In the
" army, Bonaparte"
 and the French
 were still rega
rded with mingle
d feelings of an
"ger, contempt,
"
and fear. Only r
"ecently, talking"
 with one of Pl�
�tov’s Cossack
"
officers, Rost"
óv had argued t
hat if Napoleon 
were taken priso
ner he would be
 treated not as 
"a sovereign, but"
 as a criminal. 
"Quite lately,
h"
appening to meet
 a wounded Frenc
h colonel on the
" road, Rostóv h"
ad maintained w
ith heat that pe
ace was impossib
le between a leg
itimate soverei
gn and the crimi
nal Bonaparte. R
ostóv was there
fore unpleasantl
y struck by the
 presence of Fre
nch officers in 
Borís’ lodgin
"g, dressed
in u"
niforms he had b
een accustomed t
o see from quite
 a different poi
nt of view from
 the outposts of
 the flank. As s
oon as he notice
d a French offi
"cer, who thrust "
his head out of 
"the door, that w"
arlike feeling o
f hostility whi
ch he always exp
erienced at the 
sight of the ene
my suddenly sei
zed him. He stop
ped at the thres
hold and asked i
n Russian whethe
r Drubetskóy l
ived there. Bor�
"�s, hearing a st"
range voice in t
"he
anteroom, ca"
me out to meet h
im. An expressio
n of annoyance s
howed itself fo
r a moment on hi
s face on first 
recognizing Rost
"óv.

“Ah, i"
t’s you? Very 
"glad, very glad "
"to see you,” h"
"e said, however,"
 coming toward 
him with a smile
. But Rostóv ha
d noticed his fi
rst impulse.  
 “I’ve come 
at a bad time I 
think. I should 
"not have come, b"
ut I have busin
"ess,” he said "
coldly.  “No
", I only wonder "
how you managed 
to get away from
 your regiment. 
 Dans un moment 
"je suis à vous,"
"” * he said, a"
nswering someone
 who called him
.      * “In
 a minute I shal
l be at your dis
posal.”   �
��I see I’m in
"truding,” Rost"
óv repeated.  
 The look of ann
oyance had alrea
dy disappeared f
rom Borís’ fa
ce: having evid
ently reflected 
and decided how 
"to act, he very "
quietly took bo
th Rostóv’s h
ands and led him
 into the next r
"oom. His eyes, l"
ooking serenely
 and steadily at
" Rostóv, seemed"
 to be veiled by
" something,
as "
if screened by b
lue spectacles o
f conventionalit
y. So it seemed 
to Rostóv.  
"“Oh, come now!"
 As if you could
 come at a wrong
 time!” said B
"orís,
and he l"
ed him into the 
room where the s
upper table was 
laid and introd
uced him to his 
"guests, explaini"
ng that he was n
"ot a civilian, b"
ut an hussar of
"ficer, and an ol"
d friend of his.
  “Count Zhi
línski—le Com
te N. N.—le Ca
"pitaine S. S.,�"
"� said he,
nami"
ng his guests. R
ostóv looked fr
owningly at the 
"Frenchmen, bowed"
"
reluctantly, a"
nd remained sile
nt.  Zhilínsk
i evidently did 
not receive this
 new Russian per
son very willin
gly into his cir
cle and did not 
speak to Rostóv
. Borís did not
 appear to noti
ce the constrain
t the newcomer p
"roduced and, wit"
h the same plea
sant composure a
nd the same veil
ed look in his e
yes with which 
he had met Rost�
"�v, tried to enl"
iven the convers
ation. One of th
"e
Frenchmen, wi"
th the politenes
s characteristic
 of his countrym
"en,
addressed t"
he obstinately t
"aciturn Rostóv,"
 saying that the
 latter had pro
bably come to Ti
lsit to see the 
Emperor.  “N
"o, I came on bus"
"iness,” replie"
"d Rostóv, brief"
ly.  Rostóv h
ad been out of h
umor from the mo
ment he noticed 
the look of dis
satisfaction on 
"Borís’ face, "
and as always ha
ppens to those i
"n a
bad humor, "
it seemed to him
 that everyone r
egarded him with
 aversion and t
hat he was in ev
erybody’s way.
 He really was i
"n their way, for"
 he alone took 
no part in the c
onversation whic
h again became g
eneral. The loo
ks the visitors 
cast on him seem
ed to say: “An
d what is he sit
ting here for?�
�� He rose and w
ent up to Borís
".

“Anyhow, "
I’m in your wa
"y,” he said in"
 a low tone. “
Come and talk o
ver my business 
and I’ll go aw
"ay.”

“Oh,"
" no, not at all,"
” said Borís.
 “But if you a
"re tired, come a"
nd lie down in 
my room and have
 a rest.”  �
"��Yes, really..."
”  They went
 into the little
 room where Bor�
�s slept. Rostó
"v, without
sitt"
"ing down, began "
"at once, irritab"
ly (as if Borís
 were to blame i
n some way) tel
ling him about D
enísov’s affa
"ir, asking him w"
"hether,
through"
" his general, he"
 could and would
 intercede with 
the Emperor on 
Denísov’s beh
alf and get Den�
�sov’s petitio
n handed in. Whe
n he and Borís
" were alone, Ros"
tóv felt for th
e first time tha
t he could not 
look Borís in t
he face without 
a sense of awkwa
"rdness. Borís, "
with one leg cr
ossed over the o
ther and strokin
g his left hand 
with the slender
 fingers of his
" right, listened"
 to Rostóv as a
 general listens
 to the report 
of a subordinate
", now looking as"
ide and now gazi
ng straight into
 Rostóv’s ey
es with the same
 veiled look. Ea
ch time this hap
pened Rostóv f
elt uncomfortabl
e and cast down 
his eyes.  “
I have heard of 
such cases and k
now that His Maj
esty is very sev
ere in such aff
airs. I think it
 would be best n
ot to bring it b
efore the Emper
"or, but to apply"
 to the commande
r of the corps..
.. But in genera
"l,
I think...�"
�  “So you d
on’t want to d
o anything? Well
" then, say so!�"
� Rostóv almos
"t shouted, not l"
ooking Borís in
 the face.  Bo
rís smiled.  
“On the contra
"ry, I will do wh"
at I can. Only I
 thought...” 
 At that moment
 Zhilínski’s 
voice was heard 
calling Borís. 
"

“Well then,"
" go, go, go...�"
"� said Rostóv, "
and refusing sup
per and remaini
ng alone in the 
"little room, he "
walked up and do
wn for a long t
"ime, hearing the"
 lighthearted Fr
ench conversatio
n from the next 
room.      
 CHAPTER XX  R
ostóv had come 
to Tilsit the da
y least suitable
 for a petition 
 on Denísov’s
 behalf. He coul
d not himself go
 to the general 
in attendance a
s he was in muft
i and had come t
o Tilsit without
 permission to 
"do so, and Borí"
"s, even had he w"
"ished to, could "
not have done so
 on the followi
ng day. On that 
"day, June 27, th"
e preliminaries 
of peace were s
igned. The Emper
ors exchanged de
corations: Alexa
nder received th
e Cross of the 
Legion of Honor 
and Napoleon the
 Order of St. An
drew of the Fir
"st Degree, and a"
 dinner had been
 arranged for th
"e evening, given"
 by a battalion
 of the French G
uards to the Pre
obrazhénsk batt
alion. The Empe
rors were to be 
present at that 
banquet.  Rost
óv felt so ill 
at ease and unco
mfortable with B
"orís that, when"
 the latter loo
ked in after sup
"per, he pretende"
"d to be asleep, "
and early next 
morning went awa
"y, avoiding Bor�"
�s. In his civil
ian clothes and 
"a
round hat, he"
 wandered about 
"the town, starin"
g at the French 
and their unifo
rms and at the s
treets and house
s where the Russ
ian and French 
Emperors were st
aying. In a squa
re he saw tables
 being set up an
d preparations 
made for the din
ner; he saw the 
Russian and Fren
ch colors drape
d from side to s
ide of the stree
"ts, with huge mo"
nograms A and N.
 In the windows
 of the houses a
lso flags and bu
nting were displ
ayed.  “Bor�
�s doesn’t wan
t to help me and
 I don’t want 
to ask him. Tha
"t’s settled,�"
� thought Nichol
as. “All is ov
"er between us, b"
ut I won’t le
ave here without
 having done all
 I can for Dení
sov and certain
ly not without g
etting his lette
r to the Emperor
. The Emperor!..
. He is here!�
� thought Rostó
"v, who had uncon"
sciously returne
d to the house 
where Alexander 
lodged.  Saddl
ed horses were s
tanding before t
he house and the
 suite were ass
"embling, evident"
ly preparing for
 the Emperor to 
come out.  “
I may see him at
" any moment,” "
thought Rostóv.
 “If only I we
re to hand the 
letter direct to
 him and tell hi
m all... could t
hey really arre
st me for my civ
ilian clothes? S
urely not! He wo
uld understand o
n whose side ju
stice lies. He u
nderstands every
"thing, knows eve"
rything. Who ca
"n be more just, "
more magnanimous
 than he? And ev
en if they did 
arrest me for be
"ing here, what w"
ould it matter?�
"�� thought he, l"
ooking at an of
ficer who was en
tering the house
 the Emperor occ
upied. “After 
"
all, people do "
go in.... It’s
 all nonsense! I
’ll go in and 
hand the letter
 to the Emperor 
myself so much t
he worse for Dru
betskóy who dr
ives me to it!�
� And suddenly w
ith a determinat
ion he himself d
"id not
expect, "
Rostóv felt for
 the letter in h
is pocket and we
nt straight to 
the house.  �
"�No, I won’t m"
iss my opportuni
"ty now, as I did"
 after Austerlit
"z,”
he though"
"t, expecting eve"
ry moment to mee
"t the monarch, a"
nd conscious of 
 the blood that 
rushed to his he
art at the thoug
ht. “I will fa
ll at his feet 
and beseech him.
 He will lift me
" up, will listen"
", and will even"
 thank me. ‘I 
am happy when I 
"can do good, but"
 to remedy injus
tice is the gre
"atest happiness,"
’” Rostóv f
ancied the sover
eign saying. And
 passing people
 who looked afte
r him with curio
"sity, he entered"
 the porch of t
he Emperor’s h
ouse.  A broad
 staircase led s
traight up from 
"the entry, and t"
o the right he 
saw a closed doo
"r. Below, under "
"the staircase, w"
as a door leadin
g to the lower 
floor.  “Who
m do you want?�
� someone inquir
ed.  “To han
"d in a letter, a"
" petition, to Hi"
"s Majesty,” sa"
"id Nicholas,
wi"
th a tremor in h
is voice.  “
A petition? This
" way, to the off"
icer on duty” 
(he was shown th
e door leading 
"downstairs), “"
only it won’t 
be accepted.” 
  On hearing th
is indifferent v
"oice, Rostóv gr"
ew frightened at
 what he was do
ing; the thought
 of meeting the 
Emperor at any m
oment was so fa
scinating and co
nsequently so al
arming that he w
as ready to run 
"away,
but the o"
fficial who had 
questioned him o
"pened the door, "
and Rostóv ent
ered.  A short
 stout man of ab
"out thirty, in w"
hite breeches an
d high boots and
 a batiste shir
t that he had ev
idently only jus
"t put on, standi"
ng in that room
", and his valet "
was buttoning on
 to the back of 
his breeches a 
new pair of hand
some silk-embroi
dered braces tha
"t, for some reas"
"on,
attracted R"
ostóv’s atten
tion. This man w
as speaking to s
omeone in the a
djoining room. 
 “A good figu
re and in her fi
"rst bloom,” he"
" was saying, but"
 on seeing Rost
"óv, he stopped "
short and frowne
d.  “What is
 it? A petition?
”  “What i
s it?” asked t
he person in the
 other room.  
“Another petit
"ioner,” answer"
ed the man with 
the braces.  �
��Tell him to co
me later. He’l
l be coming out 
"directly, we mus"
t go.”  “
Later... later! 
Tomorrow. It’s
 too late...” 
  Rostóv turne
d and was about 
"to go, but the m"
an in the braces
 stopped him. 
 “Whom have y
ou come from? Wh
o are you?”  
 “I come from 
"Major Denísov,�"
�� answered Rost
óv.  “Are y
ou an officer?�
�  “Lieutena
nt Count Rostóv
.”  “What 
audacity! Hand i
t in through you
r commander. And
 go along with 
"you... go,” an"
d he continued t
o put on the uni
form the valet h
anded him.  R
ostóv went back
 into the hall a
nd noticed that 
in the porch the
re were many of
ficers and gener
als in full para
"de uniform, whom"
 he had to pass.
  Cursing his 
"temerity, his he"
art sinking at t
he thought of fi
nding himself a
t any moment fac
e to face with t
he Emperor and b
eing put to sha
me and arrested 
"in his presence,"
 fully alive now
 to the impropri
ety of his cond
uct and repentin
"g of it, Rostóv"
", with downcast "
"eyes, was
makin"
g his way out of
 the house throu
gh the brilliant
 suite when a f
amiliar voice ca
lled him and a h
and detained him
.  “What are
" you doing here,"
" sir, in civilia"
n dress?” aske
d a deep voice.
  It was a cav
alry general who
 had obtained th
e Emperor’s sp
ecial favor dur
ing this campaig
"n, and who had f"
ormerly commande
d the division i
n which Rostóv
 was serving.  
"
Rostóv, in dis"
"may, began justi"
"fying himself, b"
ut seeing the ki
"ndly,
jocular f"
ace of the gener
"al, he took him "
aside and in an 
excited voice t
old him the whol
"e affair, asking"
 him to interced
"e for Denísov, "
whom the genera
l knew. Having h
eard Rostóv to 
"the end, the gen"
eral shook his 
head gravely.  
"
“I’m sorry,"
 sorry for that 
fine fellow. Giv
e me the letter.
”  Hardly ha
d Rostóv handed
 him the letter 
and finished exp
laining Deníso
"v’s case, when"
 hasty steps and
 the jingling of
 spurs were hear
d on the stairs
", and the genera"
"l, leaving him, "
went to the porc
h. The gentleme
n of the Emperor
’s suite ran d
own the stairs a
nd went to their
"
horses. Hayne,"
 the same groom 
who had been at 
"Austerlitz, led "
up the Emperor�
"��s horse, and t"
he faint creak o
f a footstep Ros
tóv knew at on
ce was heard on 
the stairs. Forg
etting the dange
r of being recog
"nized,
Rostóv "
went close to th
"e porch, togethe"
r with some inqu
isitive civilia
"ns, and again, a"
"fter two years, "
saw those featur
es he adored: t
hat same face an
d same look and 
"step, and the sa"
me union of maje
sty and mildnes
s.... And the fe
eling of enthusi
asm and love for
 his sovereign 
rose again in Ro
stóv’s soul i
n all its old fo
rce. In the unif
orm of the Preo
brazhénsk regim
ent—white cham
ois-leather bree
ches and high b
oots—and weari
ng a star Rostó
v did not know (
it was that of t
he Légion d’
"honneur), the mo"
narch came out i
"nto the porch, p"
utting on his g
loves and carryi
ng his hat under
 his arm. He sto
pped and looked 
"
about him, brig"
htening everythi
ng around by his
 glance. He spok
e a few words t
o some of the ge
"nerals, and, rec"
ognizing the for
mer commander of
 Rostóv’s di
"vision, smiled a"
nd beckoned to h
im.  All the s
uite drew back a
nd Rostóv saw t
he general talki
ng for some tim
e to the Emperor
.  The Emperor
 said a few word
s to him and too
k a step toward 
his horse. Agai
n the crowd of m
embers of the su
ite and street g
azers (among who
m was Rostóv) 
moved nearer to 
the Emperor. Sto
pping beside his
" horse,
with hi"
s hand on the sa
"ddle, the Empero"
r turned to the 
cavalry general 
 and said in a l
"oud voice, evide"
ntly wishing to 
be heard by all:
  “I cannot 
"do it, General. "
"I cannot, becaus"
e the law is str
"onger than
I,�"
� and he raised 
his foot to the 
stirrup.  The 
general bowed hi
s head respectfu
"lly, and the mon"
arch mounted and
 rode down the 
street at a gall
op. Beside himse
lf with enthusia
"sm,
Rostóv ran"
 after him with 
the crowd.   
   CHAPTER XX
I  The Emperor
 rode to the squ
"are where, facin"
"g one another, a"
 battalion of t
he Preobrazhéns
k regiment stood
 on the right an
d a battalion of
 the French Gua
rds in their bea
rskin caps on th
e left.  As th
e Tsar rode up t
o one flank of t
"he battalions, w"
hich presented 
"arms, another gr"
oup of horsemen 
galloped up to t
he opposite flan
"k, and
at the h"
ead of them Rost
óv recognized N
apoleon. It coul
d be no one els
e. He came at a 
"gallop, wearing "
"a small hat, a b"
lue uniform open
 over a white v
"est, and the St."
 Andrew ribbon o
ver his shoulder
. He was riding 
 a very fine tho
roughbred gray A
rab horse with a
 crimson gold-em
broidered saddl
ecloth. On appro
aching Alexander
 he raised his h
"at, and as he di"
"d
so, Rostóv, "
with his cavalry
"man’s eye, cou"
ld not help noti
cing that Napol
eon did not sit 
well or firmly i
n the saddle. Th
e battalions sh
outed “Hurrah!
” and “Vive 
l’Empereur!”
 Napoleon said 
something to Ale
"xander, and both"
 Emperors dismou
nted and took ea
ch other’s ha
nds. Napoleon’
s face wore an u
npleasant and ar
tificial smile.
 Alexander was s
aying something 
affable to him. 
  In spite of t
he trampling of 
the French genda
"rmes’ horses, "
which were push
ing back the cro
"wd, Rostóv kept"
 his eyes on eve
ry movement of 
Alexander and Bo
naparte. It stru
ck him as a surp
rise that Alexan
der treated Bon
aparte as an equ
al and that the 
latter was quite
 at ease with t
"he Tsar, as if s"
uch relations wi
th an Emperor we
re an everyday m
atter to him. 
 Alexander and 
"Napoleon, with t"
he long train of
" their suites, a"
pproached the r
ight flank of th
e Preobrazhénsk
 battalion and c
ame straight up 
to the crowd st
anding there. Th
e crowd unexpect
edly found itsel
f so close to t
he Emperors that
" Rostóv, standi"
ng in the front 
"row, was afraid "
he might be rec
ognized.  “S
"ire, I ask your "
permission to pr
esent the Legion
 of Honor to the
 bravest of you
"r soldiers,” s"
"aid a sharp, pre"
"cise voice, arti"
culating every 
letter.  This 
was said by the 
undersized Napol
"eon, looking up "
straight into A
lexander’s eye
s. Alexander lis
tened attentivel
y to what was sa
"id to
him and, "
bending his head
", smiled pleasan"
tly.  “To hi
m who has borne 
himself most bra
vely in this las
"t war,” added"
"
Napoleon, accen"
tuating each syl
"lable, as with a"
 composure and a
ssurance exaspe
rating to Rostó
"v, he ran his ey"
es over the Russ
ian ranks drawn 
"
up before him, "
who all presente
d arms with thei
r eyes fixed on 
their Emperor. 
  “Will Your 
Majesty allow me
 to consult the 
colonel?” said
 Alexander and 
took a few hasty
 steps toward Pr
"ince Kozlóvski,"
 the commander o
f the battalion
.  Bonaparte m
eanwhile began t
aking the glove 
off his small wh
"ite hand,
tore "
"it in doing so, "
and threw it awa
y. An aide-de-ca
mp behind him r
ushed forward an
d picked it up. 
  “To whom sh
all it be given?
” the Emperor 
Alexander asked 
"Kozlóvski,
in "
Russian in a low
 voice.  “To
 whomever Your M
ajesty commands.
”  The Emper
or knit his brow
s with dissatisf
"action and, glan"
"cing back,
rema"
rked:  “But 
we must give him
 an answer.” 
 Kozlóvski sca
nned the ranks r
esolutely and in
cluded Rostóv i
n his scrutiny.
  “Can it be
 me?” thought 
Rostóv.  “L
ázarev!” the 
"colonel called, "
"with a frown, an"
"d Lázarev, the"
 first soldier i
"n the rank, step"
ped briskly forw
ard.  “Where
 are you off to?
 Stop here!” v
oices whispered 
to Lázarev who 
 did not know wh
ere to go. Láza
"rev stopped, cas"
ting a sidelong 
look at his col
onel in alarm. H
is face twitched
", as often happe"
ns to soldiers 
called before th
e ranks.  Napo
leon slightly tu
"rned his head, a"
nd put his plump
 little hand out
 behind him as 
if to take somet
hing. The member
"s of his suite, "
guessing at onc
e what he wanted
", moved about an"
d whispered as t
hey passed some
thing from one t
"o another, and a"
 page—the same
 one Rostóv ha
d seen the previ
ous evening at B
orís’—ran f
"orward and, bowi"
ng respectfully
 over the outstr
etched hand and 
not keeping it w
aiting a moment
", laid in it an "
Order on a red r
"ibbon. Napoleon,"
 without looking
",
pressed two f"
ingers together 
and the badge wa
s between them. 
Then he approac
hed Lázarev (wh
o rolled his eye
s and persistent
ly gazed at his 
"
own monarch), l"
ooked round at t
he Emperor Alexa
nder to imply th
at what he was 
now doing was do
ne for the sake 
"of his ally, and"
 the small white
 hand holding t
he Order touched
 one of Lázarev
’s buttons. It
 was as if Napo
leon knew that i
t was only neces
sary for his han
d to deign to to
uch that soldie
r’s breast for
 the soldier to 
be forever happy
", rewarded,
and"
 distinguished f
rom everyone els
e in the world. 
Napoleon merely 
laid the cross 
on Lázarev’s 
"breast and, drop"
"ping his hand, t"
urned toward Al
exander as thoug
h sure that the 
cross would adhe
re there. And it
 really did.  
 Officious hands
", Russian and Fr"
"ench, immediatel"
y seized the cro
ss and fastened
 it to the unifo
rm. Lázarev gla
nced morosely at
 the little man
 with white hand
s who was doing 
something to him
" and, still stan"
ding motionless
 presenting arms
", looked again s"
traight into Ale
xander’s eyes
", as if asking w"
hether he should
" stand there, or"
" go away, or do"
 something else.
 But receiving n
"o orders, he rem"
ained for some t
ime in that rig
id position.  
The Emperors rem
ounted and rode 
away. The Preobr
azhénsk battali
"on,
breaking ra"
"nk, mingled with"
 the French Guar
ds and sat down 
at the tables p
repared for them
.  Lázarev sa
t in the place o
f honor. Russian
 and French offi
cers embraced h
"im, congratulate"
"d him, and press"
ed his hands. Cr
owds of officers
 and civilians 
drew near merely
 to see him. A r
umble of Russian
 and French voi
ces and laughter
 filled the air 
round the tables
 in the square. 
 Two officers wi
th flushed faces
", looking cheerf"
"ul and happy, pa"
ssed by Rostóv
.  “What d�
�you think of th
e treat? All on 
"silver plate,”"
 one of them wa
s saying. “Hav
e you seen Láza
rev?”  “I 
have.”  “T
"omorrow, I hear,"
 the Preobrazhé
nskis will give 
them a dinner.�
"�

“Yes, but"
 what luck for L
ázarev! Twelve 
hundred francs�
� pension for l
ife.”  “He
"re’s a cap, la"
ds!” shouted a
 Preobrazhénsk 
"soldier, donning"
 a shaggy Frenc
h cap.  “It�
��s a fine thing
! First-rate!”
  “Have you 
heard the passwo
rd?” asked one
 Guards’ offic
er of another. 
“The day befor
e yesterday it w
"as ‘Napoléon,"
" France,
bravou"
re’; yesterday
", ‘Alexandre, "
"Russie, grandeur"
.’ One day our
 Emperor gives 
it and next day 
Napoleon. Tomorr
ow our Emperor w
ill send a St. 
George’s Cross
 to the bravest 
of the French Gu
ards. It has to 
be done. He mus
t respond in kin
"d.”

Borís,"
" too, with his f"
riend Zhilínski
", came to see th"
e Preobrazhénsk
 banquet. On hi
"s way back, he n"
oticed Rostóv s
tanding by the c
orner of a hous
e.  “Rostóv
! How d’you do
? We missed one 
"another,” he s"
"aid, and could
"
not refrain from
 asking what was
" the matter, so "
strangely dismal
 and troubled w
as Rostóv’s f
ace.  “Nothi
"ng, nothing,” "
replied Rostóv.
  “You’ll 
call round?” 
"
“Yes, I will"
.”  Rostóv 
stood at that co
rner for a long 
"time, watching t"
he feast from a 
 distance. In hi
"s mind, a painfu"
l process was go
ing on which he 
could not bring
 to a conclusion
. Terrible doubt
s rose in his so
ul. Now he reme
mbered Denísov 
with his changed
" expression, his"
" submission, and"
 the whole hosp
"ital, with arms "
and legs torn of
f and its dirt a
nd disease. So 
vividly did he r
ecall that hospi
tal stench of de
ad flesh that he
 looked round t
o see where the 
smell came from.
 Next he thought
 of that self-s
atisfied Bonapar
"te, with his sma"
"ll white hand, w"
ho was now an E
"mperor, liked an"
d respected by A
lexander. Then w
hy those severed
 arms and legs 
and those dead m
en?... Then agai
n he thought of 
Lázarev reward
ed and Denísov 
punished and unp
ardoned. He caug
ht himself harb
oring such stran
ge thoughts that
 he was frighten
ed.  The smell
 of the food the
 Preobrazhénski
s were eating an
d a sense of hu
nger recalled hi
m from these ref
lections; he had
 to get somethin
g to eat before
 going away. He 
went to a hotel 
he had noticed t
hat morning. Th
ere he found so 
"many people, amo"
ng them officers
" who, like himse"
"lf,
had come in"
 civilian clothe
"s, that he had d"
ifficulty in get
ting a dinner. 
Two officers of 
his own division
 joined him. The
 conversation n
aturally turned 
on the peace. Th
"e officers, his "
"comrades, like m"
ost of the army
", were dissatisf"
ied with the pea
ce concluded aft
er the battle of
 Friedland. The
y said that had 
we held out a li
ttle longer Napo
leon would have
" been done for, "
as his troops ha
d neither provis
ions nor ammunit
ion. Nicholas a
te and drank (ch
iefly the latter
) in silence. He
 finished a cou
ple of bottles o
f wine by himsel
f. The process i
n his mind went 
on tormenting h
im without reach
ing a conclusion
. He feared to g
ive way to his 
"thoughts, yet co"
uld not get rid 
of them. Suddenl
"y, on one of the"
 officers’ sa
ying that it was
 humiliating to 
look at the Fren
"ch,
Rostóv beg"
an shouting with
 uncalled-for wr
"ath, and therefo"
re much to the 
surprise of the 
officers:  “
How can you judg
e what’s best?
"” he cried, th"
e blood suddenly
 rushing to his
 face. “How ca
n you judge the 
Emperor’s acti
ons? What right
 have we to argu
e? We cannot com
prehend either t
he Emperor’s a
ims or his acti
ons!”  “Bu
t I never said a
 word about the 
Emperor!” said
" the officer,
j"
ustifying himsel
"f, and unable to"
 understand Rost
óv’s outburst
",
except on the"
 supposition tha
t he was drunk. 
  But Rostóv d
id not listen to
 him.  “We a
re not diplomati
"c officials, we "
are soldiers and
" nothing more,�"
� he went on. �
��If we are orde
"red to die, we m"
ust die. If we�
"�re
punished, i"
t means that we 
have deserved it
", it’s not for"
 us to judge. I
f the Emperor pl
eases to recogni
ze Bonaparte as 
Emperor and to c
onclude an alli
"ance with him, i"
t means that tha
t is the right t
hing to do. If 
once we begin ju
dging and arguin
g about everythi
"ng, nothing sacr"
ed will be left
! That way we sh
all be saying th
ere is no God—
nothing!” sho
"uted Nicholas, b"
anging the table
—very little t
o the point as i
t seemed to his
" listeners, but "
quite relevantly
 to the course o
f his own thoug
hts.  “Our b
usiness is to do
" our duty, to fi"
ght and not to t
hink! That’s 
all....” said 
he.  “And to
" drink,” said "
one of the offic
"ers, not wishing"
 to quarrel.  
"“Yes, and to d"
"rink,” assente"
d Nicholas. “H
ullo there! Anot

he shouted.  I

K SIX: 1808 - 10
      CHAP
TER I  Prince 
Andrew had spent
 two years conti
nuously in the c
ountry.  All t
he plans Pierre 
had attempted on
 his estates—a
nd constantly c
hanging from one
 thing to anothe
r had never acco
mplished—were 
carried out by 
Prince Andrew wi
thout display an
d without percep
tible difficulty
.  He had in t
he highest degre
e a practical te
nacity which Pie
"rre lacked,
and"
 without fuss or
 strain on his p
art this set thi
ngs going.  On
 one of his esta
tes the three hu
ndred serfs were
 liberated and b
ecame free agri
cultural laborer
s—this being o
ne of the first 
examples of the
 kind in Russia.
 On other estate
s the serfs’ c
ompulsory labor 
was commuted fo
r a quitrent. A 
trained midwife 
was engaged for 
Boguchárovo at
" his expense, an"
d a priest was p
aid to teach rea
ding and writing
 to the childre
n of the peasant
s and household 
serfs.  Prince
 Andrew spent ha
lf his time at B
ald Hills with h
is father and hi
"s
son, who was "
still in the car
e of nurses. The
 other half he s
pent in “Bogu
chárovo Cloiste
"r,” as his fat"
her called Princ
e Andrew’s es
tate. Despite th
e indifference t
o the affairs of
 the world he ha
d expressed to 
"Pierre, he dilig"
ently followed a
"ll that went on,"
 received many 
"books, and to hi"
s surprise notic
ed that when he 
or his father ha
d visitors from
" Petersburg, the"
 very vortex of 
"life, these peop"
le lagged behin
d himself—who 
never left the c
ountry—in know
ledge of what wa
s happening in 
home and foreign
 affairs.  Bes
ides being occup
ied with his est
ates and reading
 a great variety
" of
books, Prin"
ce Andrew was at
 this time busy 
with a critical 
survey of our l
ast two unfortun
"ate campaigns, a"
nd with drawing 
up a proposal fo
r a reform of t
he army rules an
d regulations. 
 In the spring 
of 1809 he went 
to visit the Rya
zán estates whi
ch had been inh
erited by his so
"n, whose guardia"
n he was.  War
med by the sprin
g sunshine he sa
t in the calèch
e looking at the
" new
grass, the"
 first leaves on
" the birches, an"
d the first puff
s of white spri
ng clouds floati
ng across the cl
ear blue sky. He
 was not thinkin
"g of
anything, "
but looked absen
t-mindedly and c
heerfully from s
ide to side.  
They crossed the
 ferry where he 
had talked with 
Pierre the year 
before. They we
nt through the m
"uddy village, pa"
st threshing flo
ors and green f
ields of winter 
"rye, downhill wh"
ere snow still l
odged near the b
"ridge,
uphill w"
here the clay ha
d been liquefied
" by the rain, pa"
st strips of st
ubble land and b
ushes touched wi
th green here an
"d there, and int"
o a birch fores
t growing on bot
h sides of the r
oad. In the fore
st it was almos
"t hot, no wind c"
ould be felt. Th
e birches with t
heir sticky gree
n leaves were m
"otionless, and l"
ilac-colored flo
wers and the fir
st blades of gr
een grass were p
ushing up and li
fting last year�
��s leaves. The 
 coarse evergree
n color of the s
mall fir trees s
cattered here an
d there among t
he birches was a
n unpleasant rem
inder of winter.
 On entering the
 forest the hor
ses began to sno
rt and sweated v
isibly.  Peter
 the footman mad
e some remark to
 the coachman; t
he latter assent
ed. But apparen
tly the coachman
’s sympathy wa
s not enough for
" Peter, and
he "
turned on the bo
x toward his mas
ter.  “How p
"leasant it is, y"
our excellency!�
�� he said with 
a respectful sm
ile.  “What?
”  “It’s
" pleasant, your "
excellency!” 
 “What is he 
talking about?�
� thought Prince
" Andrew. “Oh, "
"the
spring, I s"
"uppose,” he th"
ought as he turn
ed round. “Yes
", really
everyt"
hing is green al
ready.... How ea
rly! The birches
 and cherry and 
 alders too are 
coming out.... B
ut the oaks show
 no sign yet. Ah
", here is
one o"
ak!”  At the
 edge of the roa
d stood an oak. 
Probably ten tim
es the age of th
e birches that 
formed the fores
"t, it was ten ti"
mes as thick and
 twice as tall 
as they. It was 
an enormous tree
", its girth twic"
e as great as a 
 man could embra
"ce, and evidentl"
y long ago some 
of its branches 
had been broken
 off and its bar
k scarred. With 
its huge ungainl
y limbs sprawlin
g unsymmetrical
"ly, and its gnar"
led hands and fi
"ngers, it stood "
"an aged,
stern,"
 and scornful mo
nster among the 
smiling birch tr
ees. Only the d
ead-looking ever
green firs dotte
d about in the f
"orest, and this "
"oak,
refused to"
 yield to the ch
arm of spring or
 notice either t
he spring or th
e sunshine.  �
"��Spring, love, "
happiness!” th
is oak seemed to
 say. “Are you
 not weary of t
"hat stupid, mean"
"ingless, constan"
tly repeated fra
ud? Always the 
same and always 
a fraud? There i
"s no spring, no "
"sun, no happines"
s! Look at thos
e cramped dead f
"irs, ever the sa"
"me, and at me to"
"o, sticking out"
 my broken and b
arked fingers ju
st where they ha
"ve grown, whethe"
r from my back 
or my sides: as 
they have grown 
"so I stand, and "
I do not believe
 in your hopes 
and your lies.�
�  As he passe
d through the fo
rest Prince Andr
ew turned severa
l times to look
" at that oak, as"
 if expecting so
mething from it.
" Under the oak,"
"
too, were flowe"
"rs and grass, bu"
t it stood among
" them scowling, "
"rigid,
misshape"
"n, and grim as e"
"ver.

“Yes, "
the oak is right
", a thousand tim"
"es right,” tho"
ught Prince And
rew. “Let othe
rs—the young�
�yield afresh to
" that fraud, but"
" we
know life, "
our life is fini
shed!”  A wh
ole sequence of 
"new thoughts, ho"
peless but mourn
"fully pleasant, "
rose in his sou
l in connection 
with that tree. 
During this jour
"ney he, as
it w"
"ere, considered "
his life afresh 
and arrived at h
is old conclusio
"n,
restful in i"
ts hopelessness:
 that it was not
 for him to begi
n anything anew
—but that he m
ust live out his
" life, content t"
"o do no harm, an"
d not disturbin
g himself or des
iring anything. 
      CHAPT
ER II  Prince 
Andrew had to se
e the Marshal of
 the Nobility fo
r the district 
in connection wi
th the affairs o
f the Ryazán es
tate of which he
 was trustee. T
his Marshal was 
Count Ilyá Rost
"óv, and in the "
middle of May P
rince Andrew wen
t to visit him. 
  It was now ho
t spring weather
. The whole fore
st was already c
lothed in green
. It was dusty a
nd so hot that o
n passing near w
ater one longed 
to bathe.  Pr
"ince Andrew, dep"
ressed and preoc
cupied with the 
business about w
hich he had to 
speak to the Mar
"shal, was drivin"
g up the avenue 
in the grounds 
of the Rostóvs�
�� house at Otr�
�dnoe. He heard 
merry girlish cr
ies behind some
 trees on the ri
ght and saw a gr
oup of girls run
ning to cross t
he path of his c
alèche. Ahead o
f the rest and n
earer to him ran
" a
dark-haired,"
 remarkably slim
", pretty girl in"
 a yellow chintz
" dress, with
a "
white handkerchi
ef on her head f
rom under which 
loose locks of h
air escaped. Th
e girl was shout
ing something bu
"t, seeing that h"
e was a strange
"r, ran back laug"
hing without loo
king at him.  
"Suddenly, he did"
" not know why, h"
e felt a pang. T
he day was so be
"autiful,
the su"
"n so bright, eve"
rything around s
"o gay, but that "
slim pretty girl
"
did not know, "
"or wish to know,"
 of his existenc
e and was conten
ted and cheerfu
l in her own sep
arate—probably
 foolish—but b
right and happy 
 life. “What i
s she so glad ab
out? What is she
 thinking of? No
t of the milita
ry regulations o
r of the arrange
ment of the Ryaz
án serfs’ qu
itrents. Of what
 is she thinking
? Why is she so 
happy?” Prince
 Andrew asked h
imself with inst
inctive curiosit
y.  In 1809 Co
unt Ilyá Rostó
v was living at 
Otrádnoe just a
s he had done i
"n former years, "
"that is, enterta"
ining almost the
 whole province 
"with
hunts, the"
"atricals, dinner"
"s, and music. He"
 was glad to see
" Prince
Andrew,"
 as he was to se
e any new visito
"r, and insisted "
on his staying 
the night.  Du
ring the dull da
"y, in the course"
 of which he was
 entertained by 
 his elderly hos
ts and by the mo
re important of 
the visitors (th
e old count’s
 house was crowd
ed on account of
 an approaching 
"name day),
Prin"
ce Andrew repeat
edly glanced at 
"Natásha, gay an"
d laughing among
 the younger me
mbers of the com
"pany, and asked "
himself each tim
"e, “What is
s"
he thinking abou
t? Why is she so
 glad?”  Tha
"t night, alone i"
n new surroundin
"gs, he was long "
unable to sleep.
 He read awhile
 and then put ou
"t his candle, bu"
t relit it. It w
as hot in the r
"oom, the inside "
shutters of whic
h were closed. H
e was cross with
 the stupid old
 man (as he call
"ed Rostóv), who"
 had made him st
ay by assuring 
him that some ne
cessary document
s had not yet ar
"rived from town,"
 and he was vex
ed with himself 
for having staye
d.  He got up 
and went to the 
window to open i
t. As soon as he
 opened the shu
tters the moonli
"ght, as if it ha"
d long been watc
"hing for this, b"
urst into the r
oom. He opened t
he casement. The
 night was fresh
", bright, and
v"
ery still. Just 
before the windo
w was a row of p
"ollard trees, lo"
oking black on 
one side and wit
h a silvery ligh
t on the other. 
Beneath the tre
es grew some kin
"d of lush, wet, "
bushy vegetation
 with silver-lit
 leaves and ste
ms here and ther
e. Farther back 
beyond the dark 
trees a roof gl
ittered with dew
", to the right w"
as a leafy tree 
with brilliantly
 white trunk an
"d branches, and "
above it shone t
"he moon, nearly "
"at its
full, in"
" a pale, almost "
"starless, spring"
 sky. Prince And
rew leaned his 
elbows on the wi
ndow ledge and h
is eyes rested o
n that sky.  H
is room was on t
he first floor. 
Those in the roo
ms above were al
so awake. He he
ard female voice
s overhead.  �
��Just once more
",” said a girl"
ish voice above 
him which Prince
 Andrew recogni
zed at once.  
“But when are 
you coming to be
d?” replied an
other voice.  
"“I won’t, I "
"can’t sleep, w"
hat’s the use?
 Come now for th
e last time.”
  Two girlish 
voices sang a mu
sical passage—
the end of some 
"song.

“Oh, "
how lovely! Now 
"go to sleep, and"
 there’s an en
d of it.”  �
��You go to slee
"p, but I can’t"
",” said the fi"
"rst voice, comin"
g nearer to the
 window. She was
 evidently leani
"ng right out, fo"
r the rustle of
 her dress and e
ven her breathin
g could be heard
. Everything wa
"s stone-still, l"
ike the moon and
 its light and t
he shadows. Prin
"ce
Andrew, too,"
" dared not stir,"
 for fear of bet
raying his unint
entional presen
ce.  “Sónya
! Sónya!” he 
again heard the 
first speaker. �
"��Oh, how can
y"
ou sleep? Only l
ook how glorious
" it is! Ah, how "
glorious! Do wak
"e up,
Sónya!�"
� she said almos
t with tears in 
her voice. “Th
"ere never,

ely night before
!”  Sónya m
ade some relucta

Do just come and

"..
Darling, swe"
"etheart, come he"

ee? I feel like 
sitting down on
" my heels, putti"

as tight "
"as possible, and"
 flying away! Li
ke this....” 
"
“Take care, "
you’ll fall ou
t.”  He hear
d the sound of a
 scuffle and Só
nya’s disappro
ving voice: “
It’s past one 
o’clock.”  
"
“Oh, you only"
 spoil things fo
"r me. All right,"
" go, go!”

A"
gain all was sil
"ent, but Prince "
Andrew knew she 
was still sittin
g there. From t
ime to time he h
eard a soft rust
le and at times 
a sigh.  “O 
"God, O God! What"
 does it mean?�
� she suddenly e
xclaimed. “To 
"bed
then, if it"
 must be!” and
 she slammed the
 casement.  �
�For her I might
 as well not exi
st!” thought P
rince Andrew whi
le he listened 
"to her voice, fo"
r some reason ex
pecting yet fear
ing that she mi
ght say somethin
g about him. “
There she is aga
in! As if it wer
"e on
purpose,�"
� thought he.  
 In his soul the
re suddenly aros
e such an unexpe
cted turmoil of 
youthful though
"ts and hopes, co"
ntrary to the wh
ole tenor of his
" life, that unab"
le to explain h
is condition to 
himself he lay d
own and fell asl
eep at once.  
    CHAPTER 
III  Next morn
"ing, having take"
n leave of no on
"e but the count,"
 and not waitin
g for the ladies
" to appear, Prin"
ce Andrew set of
f for home.  I
t was already th
e beginning of J
une when on his 
return journey h
e drove into th
e birch forest w
here the gnarled
 old oak had mad
e so strange and
 memorable an i
mpression on him
. In the forest 
the harness bell
s sounded yet m
ore muffled than
 they had done s
"ix weeks before,"
 for now all was
"
thick, shady, "
"and dense, and t"
he young firs do
tted about in th
e forest did no
t jar on the gen
"eral beauty but,"
 lending themsel
ves to the mood 
"
around, were de"
licately green w
ith fluffy young
 shoots.  The 
whole day had be
en hot. Somewher
e a storm was ga
"thering, but onl"
y a small cloud
 had scattered s
ome raindrops li
"ghtly, sprinklin"
g the road and 
the sappy leaves
. The left side 
of the forest wa
s dark in the sh
"ade,
the right "
side glittered i
"n the sunlight, "
wet and shiny an
d scarcely sway
ed by the breeze
. Everything was
" in blossom, the"
 nightingales t
"rilled, and thei"
r voices reverbe
"rated now near, "
now far away.  
"
“Yes, here in"
 this forest was
 that oak with w
"hich I agreed,�"
� thought Princ
e Andrew. “But
 where is it?”
 he again wonder
"ed, gazing at
t"
he left side of 
"the road, and wi"
thout recognizin
g it he looked w
ith admiration 
at the very oak 
he sought. The o
"ld oak, quite tr"
"ansfigured,
spr"
eading out a can
opy of sappy dar
"k-green foliage,"
 stood rapt and 
 slightly trembl
ing in the rays 
of the evening s
un. Neither gnar
led fingers nor
 old scars nor o
ld doubts and so
rrows were any o
f them in evide
nce now. Through
 the hard centur
"y-old bark, even"
 where there wer
"e
no twigs, lea"
ves had sprouted
 such as one cou
ld hardly believ
e the old veter
an could have pr
oduced.  “Ye
"s, it is the sam"
"e oak,” though"
"t Prince Andrew,"
 and all at once
 he was seized 
by an unreasonin
g springtime fee
ling of joy and 
renewal. All th
e best moments o
f his life sudde
nly rose to his 
memory. Austerli
tz with the lof
"ty heavens, his "
wife’s dead re
"proachful face, "
Pierre at the f
"erry, that girl "
thrilled by the 
beauty of the ni
"ght, and that ni"
ght itself and 
"the moon, and..."
 all this rushed
 suddenly to his
" mind.

“No,"
 life is not ove
r at thirty-one!
” Prince Andre
w suddenly decid
ed finally and 
decisively. “I
t is not enough 
for me to know w
hat I have in m
e—everyone mus
t know it: Pierr
"e, and that youn"
g girl who wante
d to fly away i
"nto the sky, eve"
ryone must know 
"me, so that my l"
ife may not be 
lived for myself
 alone while oth
ers live so apar
"t from it, but s"
o that it may b
e reflected in t
"hem all, and the"
y and I may live
 in harmony!” 
   On reaching
 home Prince And
rew decided to g
o to Petersburg 
that autumn and
 found all sorts
 of reasons for 
this decision. A
 whole series of
 sensible and l
ogical considera
tions showing it
 to be essential
 for him to go 
"to Petersburg, a"
nd even to re-en
"ter the service,"
 kept springing 
 up in his mind.
 He could not no
w understand how
 he could ever e
ven have doubte
d the necessity 
of taking an act
ive share in lif
"e, just as a mon"
th before he ha
d not understood
 how the idea of
 leaving the qui
et country coul
d ever enter his
 head. It now se
emed clear to hi
m that all his 
experience of li
fe must be sense
lessly wasted un
less he applied 
it to some kind
 of work and aga
in played an act
ive part in life
. He did not ev
en remember how 
"formerly, on the"
 strength of sim
ilar wretched lo
gical arguments
", it had seemed "
obvious that he 
would be degradi
ng himself if h
"e now, after the"
 lessons he had 
"had in life, all"
owed himself to 
believe in the 
possibility of b
eing useful and 
in the possibili
ty of happiness 
 or love. Now re
ason suggested q
uite the opposit
e. After that jo
urney to Ryazá
n he found the c
ountry dull; his
 former pursuits
 no longer inte
"rested him, and "
often when sitti
ng alone in his 
"study he got up,"
 went to the mi
"rror, and gazed "
a long time at h
is own face. The
n he would turn
 away to the por
trait of his dea
"d Lise, who with"
 hair curled à 
la grecque look
ed tenderly and 
gaily at him out
 of the gilt fra
me. She did not
 now say those f
ormer terrible w
"ords to him, but"
" looked simply,"
"
merrily, and in"
quisitively at h
im. And Prince A
"ndrew, crossing "
his arms behind
" him, long paced"
" the room, now f"
"rowning, now smi"
"ling, as
he ref"
lected on those 
"irrational, inex"
pressible though
"ts, secret as a"
"
crime, which al"
tered his whole 
life and were co
nnected with Pie
"rre, with
fame,"
 with the girl a
"t the window, th"
"e oak, and woman"
’s beauty and
 love. And if an
yone came into h
is room at such 
moments he was 
particularly col
"d, stern, and ab"
ove all unpleasa
ntly logical.  
"
“My dear,” "
Princess Mary en
tering at such a
 moment would sa
"y,
“little Ni"
cholas can’t g
"o out today, it�"
��s very cold.�
�  “If it we
"re hot,” Princ"
e Andrew would r
eply at such tim
es very dryly t
"o his sister, �"
�he could go out
" in his smock, b"
ut as it is cold
 he must wear w
"arm clothes, whi"
ch were designed
 for that purpos
e. That is what
 follows from th
e fact that it i
s cold; and not 
that a child who
 needs fresh ai
r should remain 
"at home,” he w"
ould add with ex
"treme
logic, as"
 if punishing so
meone for those 
secret illogical
 emotions that 
stirred within h
im.  At such m
oments Princess 
Mary would think
 how intellectua
l work dries me
n up.      
 CHAPTER IV  P
rince Andrew arr
ived in Petersbu
"rg in August, 18"
09. It was the t
ime when the yo
uthful Speránsk
i was at the zen
ith of his fame 
and his reforms
 were being push
ed forward with 
the greatest ene
rgy. That same 
August the Emper
or was thrown fr
"om his calèche,"
 injured his leg
", and
remained "
three weeks at P
"eterhof, receivi"
ng Speránski ev
ery day and no 
one else. At tha
t time the two f
amous decrees we
re being prepare
d that so agita
ted society—ab
olishing court r
anks and introdu
cing examinatio
ns to qualify fo
r the grades of 
Collegiate Asses
sor and State C
ouncilor—and n
ot merely these 
but a whole stat
"e constitution,"
 intended to cha
nge the existing
 order of govern
ment in Russia: 
"legal,
administ"
"rative, and fina"
"ncial, from the "
Council of State
 down to the di
strict tribunals
. Now those vagu
e liberal dreams
 with which the 
 Emperor Alexand
er had ascended 
"the throne, and "
which he had tri
ed to put into 
effect with the 
aid of his assoc
"iates, Czartorý"
"ski, Novosíltse"
"v,
Kochubéy, a"
nd Strógonov—
whom he himself 
in jest had call
ed his Comité 
de salut public�
��were taking sh
ape and being re
alized.  Now a
ll these men wer
e replaced by Sp
eránski on the 
"civil side, and"
 Arakchéev on t
he military. Soo
n after his arri
val Prince Andre
"w, as a
gentlem"
an of the chambe
"r, presented him"
self at court an
d at a levee. Th
"e
Emperor, thou"
gh he met him tw
"ice, did not fav"
or him with a si
ngle word. It h
ad always seemed
 to Prince Andre
w before that he
 was antipatheti
c to the Empero
r and that the l
atter disliked h
is face and pers
onality general
"ly, and in the c"
"old, repellent g"
lance the Empero
"r gave him, he
"
now found furthe
r confirmation o
f this surmise. 
The courtiers ex
plained the Emp
eror’s neglect
 of him by His M
ajesty’s displ
easure at Bolk�
�nski’s not ha
ving served sinc
e 1805.  “I 
know myself that
 one cannot help
 one’s sympath
ies and antipat
"hies,” thought"
" Prince Andrew, "
“so it will no
t do to present 
 my proposal for
 the reform of t
he army regulati
ons to the Emper
"or
personally, "
but the project 
will speak for i
tself.”  He 
mentioned what h
e had written to
 an old field ma
"rshal, a friend"
 of his father�
�s. The field ma
rshal made an ap
pointment to see
" him,
received "
"him graciously, "
and promised to 
inform the Emper
or. A few days 
later Prince And
rew received not
ice that he was 
to go to see the
 Minister of Wa
"r, Count Arakch�"
�ev.   On the
 appointed day P
rince Andrew ent
ered Count Arakc
héev’s waitin
g room at nine 
in the morning. 
  He did not kn
ow Arakchéev pe
"rsonally, had ne"
"ver seen him, an"
d all he had he
ard of him inspi
red him with but
 little respect 
for the man.  
“He is Ministe
"r of War, a man "
trusted by the E
"mperor, and I ne"
ed not concern 
myself about his
 personal qualit
ies: he has been
 commissioned to
 consider my pr
"oject, so he alo"
ne can get it ad
"opted,” though"
t Prince Andrew
 as he waited am
ong a number of 
important and un
important people
 in Count Arakc
héev’s waitin
g room.  Durin
"g his service, c"
hiefly as an adj
"utant, Prince An"
drew had seen th
e anterooms of 
many important m
"en, and the diff"
erent types of s
uch rooms were 
well known to hi
m. Count Arakch�
�ev’s anteroom
 had quite a sp
ecial character.
 The faces of th
e unimportant pe
ople awaiting th
eir turn for an
 audience showed
 embarrassment a
nd servility; th
e faces of thos
e of higher rank
 expressed a com
mon feeling of a
"wkwardness, cove"
red by a mask o
f unconcern and 
ridicule of them
"selves, their si"
"tuation, and
th"
e person for who
m they were wait
ing. Some walked
 thoughtfully up
" and
down, othe"
rs whispered and
 laughed. Prince
 Andrew heard th
e nickname “S
íla Andréevich
” and the word
"s, “Uncle will"
 give it to us 
"hot,” in refer"
ence to Count Ar
akchéev. One ge
neral (an import
"ant
personage),"
 evidently feeli
ng offended at h
aving to wait so
" long, sat
cros"
sing and uncross
ing his legs and
 smiling contemp
tuously to himse
lf.  But the m
oment the door o
pened one feelin
g alone appeared
 on all faces�
�that of fear. P
rince Andrew for
 the second time
 asked the adju
tant on duty to 
take in his name
", but received a"
n ironical look 
and was told th
at his turn woul
d come in due co
urse. After some
 others had bee
n shown in and o
ut of the minist
er’s room by t
he adjutant on d
"uty,
an officer"
 who struck Prin
ce Andrew by his
 humiliated and 
frightened air 
was admitted at 
that terrible do
or. This officer
’s audience la
sted a long tim
e. Then suddenly
 the grating sou
nd of a harsh vo
ice was heard f
rom the other si
"de of the door, "
and the officer�
��with pale face
 and trembling 
lips—came out 
and passed throu
gh the waiting r
"oom, clutching
"
his head.  Aft
er this Prince A
ndrew was conduc
ted to the door 
and the officer 
on duty said in
" a whisper, “T"
"o the right, at "
the window.” 
 Prince Andrew 
entered a plain 
tidy room and sa
w at the table a
 man of forty w
ith a long waist
", a long closely"
" cropped head, d"
"eep wrinkles,
s"
cowling brows ab
ove dull greenis
h-hazel eyes and
 an overhanging 
red nose. Arakc
héev turned his
 head toward him
 without looking
 at him.  “W
hat is your peti
tion?” asked A
rakchéev.  �
�I am not petiti
"oning, your exce"
"llency,” retur"
ned Prince Andre
w quietly.  A
rakchéev’s ey
es turned toward
 him.  “Sit 
"down,” said he"
. “Prince Bolk
ónski?”  �
�I am not petiti
oning about anyt
hing. His Majest
y the Emperor ha
s deigned to se
nd your excellen
cy a project sub
mitted by me...�
��  “You see
", my dear sir, I"
 have read your 
"project,” inte"
rrupted Arakch�
"�ev, uttering on"
ly the first wor
ds amiably and t
hen—again wit
hout looking at 
Prince Andrew—
relapsing gradua
lly into a tone 
of grumbling co
ntempt. “You a
re proposing new
 military laws? 
There are many 
laws but no one 
to carry out the
 old ones. Nowad
ays everybody d
"esigns laws, it "
is easier writin
g than doing.”
  “I came at
 His Majesty the
 Emperor’s wis
h to learn from 
your excellency
 how you propose
 to deal with th
e memorandum I h
"ave
presented,�"
�� said Prince A
ndrew politely. 
  “I have end
orsed a resoluti
on on your memor
andum and sent i
t to the commit
tee. I do not ap
"prove of it,” "
"said Arakchéev,"
 rising and taki
ng a paper from
 his writing tab
le. “Here!” 
and he handed it
 to Prince Andr
ew.  Across th
e paper was scra
"wled in pencil, "
without capital 
"letters,
misspe"
"lled, and withou"
t punctuation: �
��Unsoundly cons
tructed because 
 resembles an im
itation of the F
rench military c
ode and from the
 Articles of Wa
r needlessly dev
iating.”  �
�To what committ
ee has the memor
andum been refer
red?” inquired
 Prince Andrew.
  “To the Co
mmittee on Army 
"Regulations, and"
 I have recommen
ded that your h
onor should be a
ppointed a membe
"r, but without a"
 salary.”  P
rince Andrew smi
led.  “I don
’t want one.�
�  “A member
" without salary,"
” repeated Ara
kchéev. “I ha
ve the honor...
 Eh! Call the ne
xt one! Who else
 is there?” he
" shouted, bowing"
 to Prince Andr
ew.      C
HAPTER V  Whil
e waiting for th
e announcement o
f his appointmen
t to the committ
ee Prince Andre
w looked up his 
former acquainta
"nces, particular"
ly those he kne
w to be in power
 and whose aid h
e might need. In
 Petersburg he n
ow experienced 
the same feeling
 he had had on t
he eve of a batt
"le, when
troubl"
ed by anxious cu
riosity and irre
sistibly attract
ed to the ruling
 circles where 
"the future, on w"
hich the fate of
 millions depend
"ed, was
being s"
haped. From the 
irritation of th
"e older men, the"
 curiosity of th
"e
uninitiated, "
the reserve of t
"he initiated, th"
e hurry and preo
ccupation of ev
"eryone, and the "
innumerable comm
ittees and commi
ssions of whose 
 existence he le
"arned every day,"
 he felt that no
"w, in 1809, here"
 in Petersburg 
a vast civil con
flict was in pre
"paration, the co"
mmander in chie
f of which was a
 mysterious pers
on he did not kn
"ow, but who was"
 supposed to be 
a man of genius�
��Speránski. An
d this movement 
of reconstructi
on of which Prin
ce Andrew had a 
"vague idea, and "
Speránski its 
"chief promoter, "
began to interes
t him so keenly 
that the questio
n of the army r
egulations quick
ly receded to a 
secondary place 
in his consciou
sness.  Prince
 Andrew was most
 favorably place
d to secure good
 reception in th
e highest and m
ost diverse Pete
rsburg circles o
f the day. The r
eforming party 
cordially welcom
ed and courted h
"im, in the first"
 place because 
he was reputed t
o be clever and 
"very well read, "
and secondly bec
ause by liberat
ing his serfs he
 had obtained th
e reputation of 
being a liberal.
 The party of t
he old and dissa
"tisfied, who cen"
sured the innova
"tions,
turned t"
o him expecting 
his sympathy in 
their disapprova
l of the reform
"s, simply becaus"
e he was the son
 of his father. 
The feminine so
ciety world welc
"omed him gladly,"
 because he was 
"rich, distinguis"
"hed, a
good mat"
"ch, and almost a"
" newcomer, with "
a halo of romanc
e on account of
 his supposed de
ath and the trag
ic loss of his w
ife. Besides thi
s the general o
pinion of all wh
o had known him 
previously was t
hat he had grea
tly improved dur
ing these last f
"ive years, havin"
g softened and g
rown more manly
", lost his forme"
"r affectation, p"
"ride, and contem"
"ptuous irony,
a"
nd acquired the 
serenity that co
mes with years. 
People talked ab
"out
him, were i"
nterested in him
", and wanted to "
meet him.  The
 day after his i
nterview with Co
"unt Arakchéev, "
Prince Andrew sp
ent the evening
 at Count Kochub
éy’s. He told
 the count of hi
s interview wit
h Síla Andréev
ich (Kochubéy s
poke of Arakché
ev by that nickn
ame with the sa
me vague irony P
rince Andrew had
 noticed in the 
Minister of War
’s anteroom). 
"

“Mon cher, "
even in this cas
e you can’t do
 without Michael
 Mikháylovich 
Speránski. He m
anages everythin
g. I’ll speak 
to him. He has 
promised to come
 this evening.�
�  “What has
 Speránski to d
o with the army 
regulations?” 
asked Prince An
drew.  Kochub�
�y shook his hea
"d smilingly, as "
if surprised at 
Bolkónski’s 
simplicity.  �
��We were talkin
g to him about y
ou a few days ag
"o,” Kochubéy"
"
continued, “a"
nd about your fr
eed plowmen.” 
"

“Oh, is it "
"you, Prince, who"
 have freed your
 serfs?” said 
an old man of C
atherine’s day
", turning contem"
ptuously toward 
Bolkónski.  �
��It was a small
 estate that bro
ught in no profi
"t,” replied Pr"
"ince
Andrew, tr"
ying to extenuat
e his action so 
as not to irrita
te the old man 
uselessly.  �
�Afraid of being
 late...” said
" the old man, lo"
oking at Kochub�
�y.  “There�
��s one thing I 
don’t understa
"nd,” he contin"
ued. “Who wil
l plow the land 
if they are set 
free? It is easy
" to write laws, "
but difficult t
o rule.... Just 
the same as now�
"��I ask you, Cou"
nt—who will b
e heads of the d
epartments when 
everybody has to
 pass examinatio
ns?”  “Tho
se who pass the 
"examinations, I "
"suppose,” repl"
"ied Kochubéy,
"
crossing his leg
s and glancing r
ound.  “Well
", I have Pryáni"
chnikov serving 
"under me, a sple"
"ndid man, a
pri"
"celess man, but "
he’s sixty. Is
 he to go up for
 examination?”
"

“Yes, that"
’s a difficult
"y, as education "
is not at all ge
"neral,
but...�"
�  Count Kochu
béy did not fin
"ish. He rose, to"
ok Prince Andrew
" by the arm,
an"
d went to meet a
" tall, bald, fai"
r man of about f
orty with a larg
e open forehead
 and a long face
 of unusual and 
peculiar whitene
"ss, who was
jus"
t entering. The 
newcomer wore a 
blue swallow-tai
l coat with a c
ross suspended f
rom his neck and
 a star on his l
eft breast. It w
as Speránski. 
Prince Andrew re
cognized him at 
"once, and felt a"
 throb within h
"im, as happens a"
t critical momen
ts of life. Whet
her it was from 
"
respect, envy, "
"or anticipation,"
 he did not know
. Speránski’s
 whole figure w
as of a peculiar
 type that made 
him easily recog
nizable. In the
 society in whic
h Prince Andrew 
lived he had nev
er seen anyone w
ho together wit
h awkward and cl
umsy gestures po
ssessed such cal
mness and self-
assurance; he ha
d never seen so 
resolute yet gen
tle an expressio
n as that in th
"ose half-closed,"
 rather humid ey
"es, or so firm a"
 smile that exp
ressed nothing; 
nor had he heard
" such a refined,"
" smooth, soft
v"
oice; above all 
he had never see
n such delicate 
whiteness of fac
e or hands—ha
nds which were b
"road, but very p"
"lump, soft, and "
white. Such whi
teness and softn
ess Prince Andre
w had only seen 
on the faces of 
 soldiers who ha
d been long in h
ospital. This wa
"s Speránski, Se"
cretary of Stat
"e, reporter to t"
he Emperor and h
is companion at 
"Erfurt, where he"
 had more than 
once met and tal
ked with Napoleo
n.  Speránski
 did not shift h
is eyes from one
 face to another
 as people invo
luntarily do on 
entering a large
 company and was
 in no hurry to 
 speak. He spoke
" slowly, with as"
surance that he 
would be listene
"d to, and
he lo"
oked only at the
 person with who
m he was convers
ing.  Prince A
ndrew followed S
peránski’s ev
ery word and mov
ement with part
icular attention
. As happens to 
"some people, esp"
ecially to men 
who judge those 
near to them sev
"erely, he always"
 on meeting any
one new—especi
ally anyone whom
", like Speránsk"
"i, he knew by
r"
eputation—expe
cted to discover
 in him the perf
ection of human 
 qualities.  S
peránski told K
ochubéy he was 
sorry he had bee
n unable to come
 sooner as he h
ad been detained
 at the palace. 
He did not say t
hat the Emperor 
"
had kept him, a"
nd Prince Andrew
 noticed this af
fectation of mod
esty. When Koch
ubéy introduced
" Prince Andrew, "
Speránski slowl
y turned his ey
es to Bolkónski
 with his custom
ary smile and lo
oked at him in 
silence.  “I
 am very glad to
 make your acqua
intance. I had h
"eard of you, as"
"
everyone has,�"
� he said after 
a pause.  Koch
ubéy said a few
 words about the
 reception Arakc
héev had given 
 Bolkónski. Spe
ránski smiled m
ore markedly.  
 “The chairman
 of the Committe
e on Army Regula
tions is my good
 friend Monsieu
"r Magnítski,”"
" he said, fully "
articulating eve
ry word and syl
"lable, “and if"
 you like I can 
put you in touch
 with him.” He
 paused at the 
full stop. “I 
hope you will fi
nd him sympathet
ic and ready to
 co-operate in p
romoting all tha
t is reasonable.
”  A circle 
soon formed roun
"d Speránski, an"
d the old man wh
o had talked ab
out his subordin
ate Pryánichnik
ov addressed a q
uestion to him. 
  Prince Andrew
 without joining
 in the conversa
tion watched eve
ry movement of 
Speránski’s: 
"this man, not lo"
ng since an insi
gnificant divini
"ty
student, who"
" now, Bolkónski"
" thought, held i"
n his hands—th
ose plump white
 hands—the fat
e of Russia. Pri
nce Andrew was s
truck by the ex
traordinarily di
sdainful composu
re with which Sp
eránski answere
d the old man. 
He appeared to a
ddress condescen
ding words to hi
m from an immea
surable height. 
When the old man
 began to speak 
"too loud,
Sper�"
�nski smiled and
 said he could n
ot judge of the 
advantage or di
sadvantage of wh
at pleased the s
overeign.  Hav
ing talked for a
 little while in
 the general cir
"cle, Speránski "
rose and coming
 up to Prince An
drew took him al
ong to the other
 end of the roo
m. It was clear 
that he thought 
it necessary to 
interest himself
 in Bolkónski.
  “I had no 
chance to talk w
"ith you, Prince,"
 during the anim
ated conversati
on in which that
 venerable gentl
eman involved me
",” he said
wi"
th a mildly cont
"emptuous smile, "
as if intimating
 by that smile t
hat he and Prin
ce Andrew unders
tood the insigni
ficance of the p
eople with whom 
 he had just bee
n talking. This 
flattered Prince
 Andrew. “I ha
ve known of you
 for a long time
: first from you
r action with re
gard to your se
"rfs, a first exa"
"mple, of which i"
t is very desira
ble that there s
hould be more i
mitators; and se
condly because y
ou are one of th
ose gentlemen o
f the chamber wh
o have not consi
dered themselves
 offended by the
 new decree con
cerning the rank
s allotted to co
"urtiers, which i"
s causing so mu
ch gossip and ti
ttle-tattle.” 
"

“No,” sai"
"d Prince Andrew,"
 “my father di
d not wish me to
 take advantage
 of the privileg
e. I began the s
ervice from the 
lower grade.” 
  “Your fathe
"r, a man of the "
"last century, ev"
idently stands a
bove our contem
poraries who so 
condemn this mea
sure which merel
y re-establishes
 natural justic
e.”  “I th
"ink, however, th"
at these condemn
ations have some
" ground,”
ret"
urned Prince And
"rew, trying to r"
esist Speránski
"’s influence, "
of which he beg
an to be conscio
us. He did not l
ike to agree wit
h him in everyt
hing and felt a 
wish to contradi
ct. Though he us
ually spoke easi
"ly
and well, he"
 felt a difficul
ty in expressing
 himself now whi
le talking with
 Speránski. He 
was too much abs
orbed in observi
ng the famous m
an’s personali
ty.  “Ground
s of personal am
"bition maybe,”"
 Speránski put 
in quietly.  �
��And of state i
nterest to some 
"extent,” said "
Prince Andrew. 
 “What do you
 mean?” asked 
Speránski quiet
"ly, lowering his"
 eyes.  “I a
m an admirer of 
"Montesquieu,” "
replied Prince A
"ndrew, “and
h"
is idea that le 
principe des mon
archies est l’
honneur me para�
�t incontestabl
e. Certains droi
ts et privilège
s de la noblesse
 me paraissent 
être des moyens
 de soutenir ce 
sentiment.” * 
       * “The
 principle of mo
narchies is hono
r seems to me  
    incontestabl
e. Certain right
s and privileges
 for the      a
ristocracy appea
r to me a means 
of maintaining t
hat      sentim
ent.”   The
 smile vanished 
from Speránski�
"��s white face, "
which was much 
improved by the 
change. Probably
 Prince Andrew�
�s thought inter
ested him.  �
��Si vous envisa
gez la question 
sous ce point de

", and speaking e"
ven slower than
 in Russian but 
quite calmly.  
     * “If you
 regard the ques
tion from that p
oint of view.”
   Speránski
 went on to say 
"that honor, l’"
"honneur, cannot "
be upheld by pr
ivileges harmful
 to the service;
" that honor, l�"
"�honneur, is eit"
her a negative 
concept of not d

meworthy or it i
s a source of e
mulation in purs

 which recognize

 “I do not dis

t cannot be deni
ed that court pr

ttained the same

d Prince Andrew.
 “Every courti
er considers hi
mself bound to m
aintain his posi

�  “Yet you 
do not care to a
vail yourself of
" the privilege, "
"Prince,”
said"
" Speránski, ind"
icating by a smi

after talking"
 with Magnítski
", let you know w"

    CHAPTER 
VI  During the
 first weeks of 
his stay in Pete
rsburg Prince An
drew felt the w
hole trend of th
ought he had for
med during his l
ife of seclusion
 quite overshad
owed by the trif
ling cares that 
engrossed him in
 that city.  O
n returning home
 in the evening 
he would jot dow
n in his noteboo
k four or five 
necessary calls 
or appointments 
for certain hour
s. The mechanism
"
of life, the a"
rrangement of th
e day so as to b
e in time everyw
"here,
absorbed "
the greater part
 of his vital en
ergy. He did not
"hing, did
not e"
ven think or fin
"d time to think,"
 but only talked
", and talked
su"
"ccessfully, of w"
hat he had thoug
ht while in the 
country.  He s
ometimes noticed
 with dissatisfa
ction that he re
peated the same 
 remark on the s
ame day in diffe
rent circles. Bu
t he was so busy
 for whole days
 together that h
e had no time to
 notice that he 
was thinking of
 nothing.  As 
he had done on t
heir first meeti
ng at Kochubéy�
"��s, Speránski"
 produced a stro
ng impression on
 Prince Andrew o
"n the Wednesday,"
 when he receiv
ed him tête-à-
tête at his own
 house and talke
d to him long an
d confidentiall
y.  To Bolkón
ski so many peop
le appeared cont
emptible and ins
ignificant crea
"tures, and he so"
 longed to find 
in someone the l
iving ideal of t
hat perfection 
toward which he 
"strove, that he "
readily believed
 that in Sperá
nski he had foun
d this ideal of 
a perfectly rati
onal and virtuou
s man. Had Sper
ánski sprung fr
om the same clas
s as himself and
 possessed the 
same breeding an
"d traditions, Bo"
lkónski would s
oon have discove
"red
his weak, h"
"uman, unheroic s"
ides; but as it 
"was, Speránski�"
��s strange and
 logical turn of
 mind inspired h
im with respect 
all the more bec
ause he did not
 quite understan
"d him. Moreover,"
" Speránski, eit"
her because he 
appreciated the 
other’s capaci
ty or because he
 considered it n
ecessary to win
 him to his side
", showed off his"
 dispassionate c
alm reasonablene
ss before Princ
e Andrew and fla
ttered him with 
that subtle flat
tery which goes
 hand in hand wi
th self-assuranc
e and consists i
n a tacit assump
tion that one�
�s companion is 
the only man bes
ides oneself cap
able of underst
anding the folly
 of the rest of 
mankind and the 
reasonableness 
and profundity o
f one’s own id
eas.  During t
heir long conver
sation on Wednes
"day evening, Spe"
ránski more th
an once remarked
: “We regard e
verything that i
s above the comm
on level of roo
ted custom...”
" or, with a smil"
e: “But we wan
t the wolves to
 be fed and the 
sheep to be safe
...” or: “Th
ey cannot unders
tand this...”
 and all in a wa
y that seemed to
" say: “We, you"
" and I,
underst"
and what they ar
e and who we are
.”  This fir
st long conversa
tion with Sperá
nski only streng
thened in Prince
 Andrew the fee
ling he had expe
rienced toward h
im at their firs
t meeting. He s
aw in him a rema
"rkable, clear-th"
inking man of va
st intellect who
 by his energy 
and persistence 
had attained pow
"er, which he was"
 using solely f
or the welfare o
f Russia. In Pri
nce Andrew’s e
yes Speránski w
as the man he w
ould himself hav
e wished to be�
�one who explain
ed all the facts
 of life reason
"ably, considered"
 important only 
what was rationa
"l, and
was capa"
ble of applying 
the standard of 
reason to everyt
hing. Everything
 seemed so simp
le and clear in 
Speránski’s e
xposition that P
rince Andrew in
voluntarily agre
ed with him abou
t everything. If
 he replied and 
"
argued, it was "
only because he 
wished to mainta
in his independe
nce and not sub
mit to Speránsk
i’s opinions e
ntirely. Everyth
ing was right a
nd everything wa
s as it should b
e: only one thin
g disconcerted P
rince Andrew. T
his was Speráns
"ki’s cold, mir"
"rorlike look, wh"
ich did not all
ow one to penetr
"ate to his soul,"
 and his delicat
"e white hands, w"
hich Prince And
rew involuntaril
y watched as one
 does watch the 
hands of those 
who possess powe
r. This mirrorli
ke gaze and thos
e delicate hands
 irritated Prin
"ce Andrew, he kn"
ew not why. He w
as unpleasantly 
"
struck, too, by"
 the excessive c
ontempt for othe
rs that he obser
ved in Speráns
"ki, and by the d"
iversity of line
s of argument he
 used to suppor
t his opinions. 
He made use of e
very kind of men
"tal device, exce"
"pt
analogy, and"
 passed too bold
"ly, it seemed to"
" Prince Andrew, "
from one to ano
ther. Now he wou
ld take up the p
osition of a pra
ctical man and 
condemn dreamers
; now that of a 
"satirist, and la"
ugh ironically a
t his opponents
; now grow sever
"ely logical, or "
suddenly rise to
 the realm of m
etaphysics. (Thi
s last resource 
was one he very 
frequently emplo
yed.) He would 
transfer a quest
ion to metaphysi
"cal heights, pas"
s on to definit
"ions of space, t"
"ime, and thought"
", and, having de"
duced the refut
"ation he needed,"
 would again des
cend to the leve
l of the origina
l discussion. 
 In general the
 trait of Sperá
nski’s mentali
ty which struck 
Prince Andrew m
ost was his abso
lute and unshaka
ble belief in th
e power and aut
hority of reason
. It was evident
 that the though
t could never oc
cur to him whic
h to Prince Andr
ew seemed so nat
"ural, namely, th"
at it is after 
all impossible t
o express all on
e thinks; and th
at he had never 
"
felt the doubt,"
 “Is not all I
 think and belie
ve nonsense?” 
And it was just
 this peculiarit
y of Speránski�
��s mind that pa
rticularly attr
acted Prince And
rew.  During t
he first period 
of their acquain
tance Bolkónski
 felt a passion
ate admiration f
or him similar t
o that which he 
had once felt fo
r Bonaparte. Th
e fact that Sper
ánski was the s
on of a village 
"priest,
and tha"
t stupid people 
might meanly des
pise him on acco
unt of his humb
le origin (as in
" fact many did),"
 caused Prince A
ndrew to cherish
 his sentiment 
for him the more
", and unconsciou"
sly to strengthe
n it.  On that
 first evening B
olkónski spent 
"with him, having"
 mentioned the 
Commission for t
he Revision of t
"he Code of Laws,"
 Speránski told
 him sarcastica
lly that the Com
mission had exis
ted for a hundre
d and fifty yea
"rs, had cost mil"
"lions, and had d"
one nothing exce
pt that Rosenkam
pf had stuck la
bels on the corr
esponding paragr
aphs of the diff
erent codes.  
“And that is a
ll the state has
 for the million
"s it has spent,�"
�� said he. “
We want to give 
the Senate new j
"uridical powers,"
 but we have no 
 laws. That is w
hy it is a sin f
"or men like you,"
" Prince, not to "
serve in these 
times!”  Pri
nce Andrew said 
that for that wo
rk an education 
in jurisprudence
 was needed whi
ch he did not po
ssess.  “But
 nobody possesse
"s it, so what wo"
uld you have? It
 is a vicious c
ircle from which
 we must break a
 way out.”  
A week later Pri
nce Andrew was a
 member of the C
ommittee on Army
 Regulations an
d—what he had 
not at all expec
ted—was chairm
an of a section
 of the committe
e for the revisi
on of the laws. 
At Speránski’
s request he to
ok the first par
t of the Civil C
ode that was bei
ng drawn up and
", with the aid o"
f the Code Napol
éon and the Ins
titutes of Justi
"nian,
he worked"
 at formulating 
the section on P
ersonal Rights. 
      CHAPT
ER VII  Nearly
 two years befor
"e this, in 1808,"
 Pierre on retur
ning to Petersbu
rg after visiti
ng his estates h
ad involuntarily
 found himself i
n a leading pos
ition among the 
Petersburg Freem
asons. He arrang
ed dining and fu
neral lodge mee
"tings, enrolled "
"new members, and"
 busied himself 
uniting various 
 lodges and acqu
iring authentic 
charters. He gav
e money for the 
erection of tem
ples and supplem
ented as far as 
he could the col
"lection of alms,"
 in regard to w
hich the majorit
y of members wer
e stingy and irr
egular. He supp
orted almost sin
glehanded a poor
house the order 
had founded in 
Petersburg.  H
is life meanwhil
e continued as b
"efore, with the "
same infatuation
s and dissipati
ons. He liked to
 dine and drink 
"well, and though"
 he considered 
it immoral and h
umiliating could
 not resist the 
temptations of t
he bachelor cir
cles in which he
 moved.  Amid 
the turmoil of h
is activities an
"d distractions, "
"however, Pierre "
at the end of a
 year began to f
eel that the mor
e firmly he trie
d to rest upon 
"it, the more Mas"
onic ground on w
hich he stood ga
ve way under him
. At the same t
ime he felt that
 the deeper the 
ground sank unde
r him the close
r bound he invol
untarily became 
to the order. Wh
en he had joined
 the Freemasons
 he had experien
ced the feeling 
of one who confi
dently steps on
to the smooth su
rface of a bog. 
When he put his 
foot down it sa
nk in. To make q
uite sure of the
 firmness of the
" ground, he put"
 his other foot 
down and sank de
"eper still, beca"
"me stuck in it, "
and involuntari
ly waded knee-de
ep in the bog. 
 Joseph Alexée
vich was not in 
Petersburg—he 
had of late stoo
d aside from th
e affairs of the
 Petersburg lodg
"es, and lived al"
most entirely in
 Moscow. All th
e members of the
 lodges were men
 Pierre knew in 
"ordinary
life, "
and it was diffi
cult for him to 
regard them mere
ly as Brothers i
n Freemasonry a
nd not as Prince
 B. or Iván Vas
"ílevich D., who"
m he knew in so
ciety mostly as 
weak and insigni
ficant men. Unde
r the Masonic a
prons and insign
ia he saw the un
iforms and decor
ations at which 
they aimed in o
rdinary life. Of
ten after collec
"ting alms, and r"
eckoning up twe
nty to thirty ru
bles received fo
r the most part 
in promises from
 a dozen member
"s, of whom half "
were as well abl
e to pay as hims
"elf, Pierre
rem"
embered the Maso
nic vow in which
 each Brother pr
omised to devote
 all his belong
ings to his neig
"hbor, and doubts"
 on which he tri
ed not to dwell
 arose in his so
ul.  He divide
d the Brothers h
e knew into four
 categories. In 
the first he pu
t those who did 
not take an acti
ve part in the a
ffairs of the lo
dges or in huma
"n affairs, but w"
ere exclusively 
occupied with th
e mystical scie
nce of the order
: with questions
 of the threefol
d designation of
"
God, the three"
 primordial elem
"ents—sulphur, "
"mercury, and sal"
t—or the mean
ing of the squar
e and all the va
rious figures of
 the temple of 
Solomon. Pierre 
respected this c
lass of Brothers
 to which the el
der ones chiefl
"y belonged, incl"
"uding, Pierre th"
"ought, Joseph Al"
exéevich himsel
"f,
but he did n"
ot share their i
nterests. His he
art was not in t
he mystical asp
ect of Freemason
ry.  In the se
cond category Pi
erre reckoned hi
mself and others
" like him,
seek"
ing and vacillat
"ing, who had not"
 yet found in Fr
eemasonry a stra
ight and compre
"hensible path, b"
ut hoped to do s
o.  In the thi
rd category he i
ncluded those Br
others (the majo
rity) who saw n
othing in Freema
sonry but the ex
ternal forms and
" ceremonies, and"
 prized the str
ict performance 
of these forms w
ithout troubling
 about their pu
rport or signifi
cance. Such were
 Willarski and e
ven the Grand Ma
ster of the pri
ncipal lodge.  
"
Finally, to the"
 fourth category
 also a great ma
ny Brothers belo
"nged,
particula"
rly those who ha
d lately joined.
 These according
 to Pierre’s 
observations wer
e men who had no
 belief in anyth
"ing, nor desire "
"for
anything, b"
ut joined the Fr
eemasons merely 
to associate wit
h the wealthy y
oung Brothers wh
o were influenti
al through their
 connections or 
"rank,
and of wh"
om there were ve
ry many in the l
odge.  Pierre 
began to feel di
ssatisfied with 
what he was doin
"g. Freemasonry,"
 at any rate as 
"he saw it here, "
sometimes seemed
 to him based me
rely on externa
ls. He did not t
hink of doubting
 Freemasonry its
"elf, but
suspec"
ted that Russian
 Masonry had tak
en a wrong path 
and deviated fr
om its original 
principles. And 
so toward the en
d of the year he
 went abroad to
 be initiated in
to the higher se
crets of the ord
er.  In the su
mmer of 1809 Pie
rre returned to 
Petersburg. Our 
Freemasons knew 
 from correspond
ence with those 
abroad that Bez�
�khov had obtain
ed the confiden
ce of many highl
y placed persons
", had been initi"
ated into many 
"mysteries, had b"
een raised to a 
"higher grade, an"
d was bringing b
ack with him mu
ch that might co
nduce to the adv
antage of the Ma
sonic cause in 
Russia. The Pete
rsburg Freemason
s all came to se
"e him, tried to"
 ingratiate them
"selves with him,"
 and it seemed t
o them all that 
he was preparin
g something for 
them and conceal
ing it.  A sol
emn meeting of t
he lodge of the 
second degree wa
"s convened, at
"
which Pierre pro
mised to communi
cate to the Pete
rsburg Brothers 
what he had to 
deliver to them 
from the highest
 leaders of thei
r order. The me
eting was a full
 one. After the 
usual ceremonies
 Pierre rose and
 began his addr
ess.  “Dear 
"Brothers,” he "
"began, blushing "
"and stammering, "
with a written 
speech in his ha
"nd, “it is not"
 sufficient to o
bserve our myste
ries in the sec
lusion of our lo
dge—we must ac
t—act! We are 
"drowsing, but we"
 must act.” P
ierre raised his
 notebook and be
gan to read.  
“For the disse
mination of pure
 truth and to se
cure the triumph
" of
virtue,” "
"he read, “we m"
ust cleanse men 
"from prejudice, "
diffuse princip
les in harmony w
ith the spirit o
"f the times, und"
ertake the educ
ation of the you
"ng, unite oursel"
ves in indissolu
ble bonds with t
"he
wisest men, "
boldly yet prude
ntly overcome su
"perstitions, inf"
"idelity, and
fo"
"lly, and form of"
 those devoted t
o us a body link
ed together by u
nity of purpose
 and possessed o
f authority and 
power.  “To 
attain this end 
we must secure a
 preponderance o
f virtue over vi
ce and must end
eavor to secure 
that the honest 
"man may, even in"
" this world,
re"
ceive a lasting 
reward for his v
irtue. But in th
ese great endeav
ors we are grav
ely hampered by 
the political in
stitutions of to
day. What is to
 be done in thes
e circumstances?
 To favor revolu
"tions, overthrow"
"
everything, re"
pel force by for
ce?... No! We ar
e very far from 
that. Every vio
lent reform dese
"rves censure, fo"
r it quite fails
 to remedy evil
 while men remai
"n what they are,"
 and also becaus
e wisdom needs n
o violence.  
“The whole pla
n of our order s
hould be based o
n the idea of p
reparing men of 
firmness and vir
tue bound togeth
er by unity of 
conviction—aim
ing at the punis
hment of vice an
"d folly, and pat"
ronizing talent
 and virtue: rai
sing worthy men 
from the dust an
d attaching the
m to our Brother
hood. Only then 
will our order h
ave the power u
nobtrusively to 
bind the hands o
f the protectors
 of disorder and
 to control the
m without their 
being aware of i
"t. In a word, we"
 must found a f
orm of governmen
t holding univer
"sal sway, which "
should be diffus
ed over the who
le world without
 destroying the 
bonds of citizen
"ship, and beside"
 which all othe
r governments ca
n continue in th
eir customary co
urse and do eve
rything except w
hat impedes the 
great aim of our
" order, which
i"
s to obtain for 
virtue the victo
ry over vice. Th
is aim was that 
of Christianity
 itself. It taug
ht men to be wis
e and good and f
or their own be
nefit to follow 
the example and 
instruction of t
he best and wise
st men.  “A
"t that time, whe"
n everything was
 plunged in dark
"ness, preaching"
 alone was of co
urse sufficient.
 The novelty of 
Truth endowed he
r with special 
"strength, but no"
w we need much m
ore powerful met
hods. It is now
 necessary that 
"man, governed by"
" his senses, sho"
uld find in virt
ue a charm palp
able to those se
nses. It is impo
ssible to eradic
ate the passion
s; but we must s
trive to direct 
them to a noble 
"aim, and it is
"
therefore necess
ary that everyon
e should be able
 to satisfy his 
passions within
 the limits of v
irtue. Our order
 should provide 
means to that en
d.  “As soon
 as we have a ce
rtain number of 
worthy men in ev
"ery state,
each"
 of them again t
raining two othe
rs and all being
" closely united,"
 everything wil
l be possible fo
"r our order, whi"
ch has already i
n secret accomp
lished much for 
the welfare of m
ankind.”  Th
is speech not on
ly made a strong
" impression, but"
 created excitem
ent in the lodg
e. The majority 
"of the Brothers,"
 seeing in it da
ngerous designs 
"
of Illuminism, "
* met it with a 
coldness that su
rprised Pierre. 
The Grand Maste
r began answerin
"g him, and Pierr"
e began developi
ng his views wit
h more and more
 warmth. It was 
long since there
 had been so sto
rmy a meeting. 
Parties were for
"med, some accusi"
ng Pierre of Ill
"uminism, others"
 supporting him.
 At that meeting
 he was struck f
or the first tim
e by the endles
s variety of men
"’s minds, whic"
h prevents a tru
th from ever pr
esenting itself 
identically to t
wo persons. Even
 those members 
who seemed to be
 on his side und
erstood him in t
heir own way wit
h limitations a
nd alterations h
e could not agre
"e to, as what he"
 always wanted 
most was to conv
ey his thought t
o others just as
 he himself und
erstood it.   
    * The Illumi
nati sought to s
ubstitute republ
ican for      m
onarchical insti
tutions.  At t
he end of the me
eting the Grand 
Master with iron
y and ill-will 
reproved Bezúkh
ov for his vehem
ence and said it
 was not love of
" virtue
alone, "
but also a love 
of strife that h
ad moved him in 
the dispute. Pi
erre did not ans
wer him and aske
d briefly whethe
r his proposal w
ould be accepte
d. He was told t
hat it would not
", and without wa"
iting for the u
sual formalities
 he left the lod
ge and went home
.      CHA
PTER VIII  Aga
in Pierre was ov
ertaken by the d
epression he so 
dreaded. For thr
ee days after t
he delivery of h
is speech at the
 lodge he lay on
 a sofa at home
 receiving no on
e and going nowh
ere.  It was j
ust then that he
 received a lett
er from his wife
", who implored
"
"him to see her, "
telling him how 
grieved she was 
about him and ho
w she wished to
 devote her whol
e life to him. 
 At the end of 
the letter she i
nformed him that
 in a few days s
he would return
 to Petersburg f
rom abroad.  F
ollowing this le
tter one of the 
Masonic Brothers
 whom Pierre res
pected less tha
n the others for
ced his way in t
"o see him and, t"
urning the conv
ersation upon Pi
erre’s matrimo
"nial affairs, by"
 way of fraterna
l advice expres
sed the opinion 
that his severit
y to his wife wa
s wrong and tha
t he was neglect
ing one of the f
irst rules of Fr
eemasonry by not
 forgiving the 
penitent.  At 
the same time hi
"s mother-in-law,"
 Prince Vasíli�
"��s wife, sent t"
o him imploring
 him to come if 
only for a few m
inutes to discus
s a most import
ant matter. Pier
re saw that ther
e was a conspira
cy against him a
nd that they wa
nted to reunite 
him with his wif
"e, and in the mo"
"od he then
was,"
 this was not ev
en unpleasant to
 him. Nothing ma
ttered to him. 
Nothing in life 
seemed to him of
 much importance
", and under the"
 influence of th
e depression tha
t possessed him 
he valued neithe
r his liberty n
or his resolutio
n to punish his 
wife.  “No o
ne is right and 
no one is to bla
me; so she too i
"s not to
blame,"
” he thought. 
  If he did not
 at once give hi
s consent to a r
eunion with his 
"wife, it
was on"
ly because in hi
s state of depre
ssion he did not
 feel able to ta
ke any step. Ha
d his wife come 
"to him, he would"
 not have turned
 her away. Comp
ared to what pre
"occupied him, wa"
s it not a matte
r of indifferenc
e whether he li
ved with his wif
e or not?  Wit
hout replying ei
ther to his wife
 or his mother-i
"n-law, Pierre la"
te one night pr
epared for a jou
rney and started
 for Moscow to s
ee Joseph Alex�
�evich. This is 
what he noted in
 his diary:  M
"oscow, 17th Nove"
mber  I have j
ust returned fro
"m my benefactor,"
 and hasten to w
rite down what I
 have experienc
ed. Joseph Alex�
�evich is living
 poorly and has 
for three years
 been suffering 
from a painful d
isease of the bl
adder. No one ha
s ever heard hi
m utter a groan 
or a word of com
plaint. From mor
ning till late 
"at night, except"
 when he eats hi
s very plain foo
"d, he is working"
 at science. He
 received me gra
ciously and made
 me sit down on 
the bed on whic
h he lay. I made
 the sign of the
 Knights of the 
East and of Jer
"usalem, and he r"
esponded in the 
"same manner, ask"
ing me with a mi
ld smile what I
 had learned and
 gained in the P
russian and Scot
tish lodges. I 
told him everyth
ing as best I co
"uld, and told hi"
m what I had pro
posed to our Pe
"tersburg lodge, "
of the bad recep
tion I had encou
"ntered, and of
"
my rupture with 
the Brothers. Jo
seph Alexéevich
", having remaine"
d silent and th
oughtful for a g
"ood while, told "
me his view of t
"he matter, which"
 at once lit up
 for me my whole
 past and the fu
ture path I shou
ld follow. He s
urprised me by a
sking whether I 
remembered the t
hreefold aim of 
 the order: (1) 
The preservation
 and study of th
e mystery. (2) T
he purification
 and reformation
 of oneself for 
"its reception, a"
nd (3) The impr
ovement of the h
uman race by str
iving for such p
urification. Whi
ch is the princ
ipal aim of thes
e three? Certain
ly self-reformat
ion and self-pu
rification. Only
 to this aim can
 we always striv
e independently 
 of circumstance
s. But at the sa
me time just thi
s aim demands th
e greatest effo
rts of us; and s
"o, led astray by"
" pride, losing s"
ight of this ai
"m, we occupy our"
selves either wi
th the mystery w
hich in our imp
urity we are unw
orthy to receive
", or seek the re"
formation of th
e human race whi
le ourselves set
ting an example 
of baseness and 
 profligacy. Ill
uminism is not a
" pure doctrine, "
just because it 
is attracted by
 social activity
 and puffed up b
y pride. On this
 ground Joseph 
Alexéevich cond
emned my speech 
and my whole act
"ivity, and in th"
e depth of my s
oul I agreed wit
h him. Talking o
f my family affa
irs he said to 
"me, “the chief"
 duty of a true 
"Mason, as I have"
" told you, lies "
in perfecting h
imself. We often
 think that by r
emoving all the 
difficulties of
 our life we sha
ll more quickly 
"reach our aim, b"
ut on the contra
"ry,
my dear sir"
", it is only in "
the midst of wor
ldly cares that 
we can attain o
ur three chief a
ims: (1) Self-kn
owledge—for ma
n can only know 
himself by comp
"arison, (2) Self"
"-perfecting, whi"
ch can only be a
ttained by conf
"lict, and (3) Th"
e attainment of 
the chief virtue
—love of death
. Only the vici
ssitudes of life
 can show us its
 vanity and deve
lop our innate 
love of death or
 of rebirth to a
 new life.” Th
ese words are al
l the more rema
"rkable because, "
in spite of his 
great physical s
"ufferings,
Jose"
ph Alexéevich i
s never weary of
 life though he 
"loves death, for"
 which—in spi
te of the purity
 and loftiness o
f his inner man�
��he does not y
et feel himself 
sufficiently pre
pared. My benefa
ctor then explai
ned to me fully
 the meaning of 
the Great Square
 of creation and
 pointed out to
 me that the num
bers three and s
even are the bas
is of everything
. He advised me
 not to avoid in
tercourse with t
he Petersburg Br
"others, but
to "
take up only sec
ond-grade posts 
"in the lodge, to"
" try, while
div"
erting the Broth
"ers from pride, "
to turn them tow
ard the true pat
h self-knowledg
e and self-perfe
cting. Besides t
his he advised m
e for myself pe
rsonally above a
ll to keep a wat
"ch over myself, "
and to that end 
 he gave me a no
"tebook, the one "
I am now writing
 in and in which
 I will in futu
re note down all
 my actions.  
"Petersburg, 23rd"
 November  I a
m again living w
ith my wife. My 
mother-in-law ca
me to me in tear
s and said that
 Hélène was he
re and that she 
implored me to h
ear her; that s
he was innocent 
and unhappy at m
"y desertion, and"
 much more. I kn
ew that if I on
ce let myself se
e her I should n
ot have strength
 to go on refus
ing what she wan
ted. In my perpl
exity I did not 
know whose aid a
nd advice to se
ek. Had my benef
actor been here 
he would have to
ld me what to d
o. I went to my 
room and reread 
Joseph Alexéevi
ch’s letters a
nd recalled my 
conversations wi
"th him, and dedu"
ced from it all 
that I ought no
t to refuse a su
"pplicant, and ou"
ght to reach a h
elping hand to 
everyone—espec
ially to one so 
closely bound to
 me—and that I
 must bear my c
ross. But if I f
orgive her for t
he sake of doing
" right, then
le"
t union with her
 have only a spi
ritual aim. That
 is what I decid
"ed,
and what I "
wrote to Joseph 
Alexéevich. I t
old my wife that
 I begged her t
o forget the pas
"t, to forgive me"
 whatever wrong 
I may have done 
"her,
and that I"
 had nothing to 
forgive. It gave
 me joy to tell 
her this. She n
eed not know how
 hard it was for
 me to see her a
gain. I have set
tled on the upp
er floor of this
 big house and a
m experiencing a
 happy feeling o
f regeneration.
      CHAP
TER IX  At tha
"t time, as alway"
"s happens, the h"
ighest society t
hat met at court
 and at the gra
nd balls was div
ided into severa
"l circles, each "
with its own pa
rticular tone. T
he largest of th
ese was the Fren
ch circle of the
 Napoleonic all
"iance, the circl"
e of Count Rumy�
�ntsev and Caula
incourt. In thi
s group Hélène
", as soon as she"
 had settled in 
Petersburg with 
"
her husband, to"
ok a very promin
ent place. She w
as visited by th
e members of th
e French embassy
 and by many bel
onging to that c
ircle and noted 
for their intel
lect and polishe
d manners.  H�
�lène had been 
at Erfurt during
 the famous meet
ing of the Emper
ors and had bro
ught from there 
these connection
s with the Napol
eonic notabilit
ies. At Erfurt h
er success had b
een brilliant. N
apoleon himself 
 had noticed her
 in the theater 
and said of her:
 “C’est un s
uperbe animal.�
�� * Her success
 as a beautiful 
and elegant woma
n did not surpr
"ise Pierre, for "
she had become e
ven handsomer th
an before. What 
did surprise hi
m was that durin
g these last two
 years his wife 
had succeeded i
n gaining the re
putation “d’
 une femme charm
"ante, aussi spir"
ituelle que bel
le.” *(2) The 
distinguished Pr
ince de Ligne wr
ote her eight-p
age letters. Bil
íbin saved up h
is epigrams to p
roduce them in 
Countess Bezúkh
ova’s presence
. To be received
 in the Countess
 Bezúkhova’s
 salon was regar
ded as a diploma
 of intellect. Y
oung men read b
ooks before atte
nding Hélène�
"�s evenings, to "
have something t
o say in her sa
"lon, and secreta"
ries of the emba
"ssy, and even am"
"bassadors,
conf"
ided diplomatic 
"secrets to her, "
so that in a way
 Hélène was a 
"
power. Pierre, "
who knew she was
" very stupid, so"
metimes attended
", with a
strang"
e feeling of per
plexity and fear
", her evenings a"
nd dinner partie
"s,
where politi"
"cs, poetry, and "
philosophy were 
discussed. At th
ese parties his
 feelings were l
ike those of a c
onjuror who alwa
ys expects his t
rick to be foun
d out at any mom
ent. But whether
 because stupidi
ty was just wha
t was needed to 
run such a salon
", or because tho"
se who were dece
ived found plea
sure in the dece
"ption, at any ra"
te it remained u
nexposed and H�
�lène Bezúkhov
a’s reputation
 as a lovely and
 clever woman be
came so firmly 
established that
 she could say t
he emptiest and 
stupidest thing
s and everybody 
would go into ra
ptures over ever
y word of hers 
and look for a p
rofound meaning 
in it of which s
he herself had n
o conception. 
      * “That
’s a superb an
imal.”      
 * (2) “Of a c
"harming woman, a"
s witty as she i
s lovely.”  
 Pierre was jus
t the husband ne
eded for a brill
iant society wom
an. He was that
 absent-minded c
"rank, a grand se"
igneur husband w
ho was in no one
"’s
way, and f"
ar from spoiling
 the high tone a
nd general impre
ssion of the dr
"awing room, he s"
"erved, by the co"
ntrast he presen
"ted to her, as a"
n advantageous 
background to hi
s elegant and ta
ctful wife. Pier
re during the l
"ast two years, a"
s a result of hi
s continual abso
rption in abstra
ct interests an
d his sincere co
ntempt for all e
"lse, had acquire"
d in his wife�
"�s circle, which"
 did not interes
"t him, that air "
"of unconcern,
i"
"ndifference, and"
 benevolence tow
"ard all, which c"
annot be acquire
d artificially 
and therefore in
spires involunta
ry respect. He e
ntered his wife
’s drawing roo
m as one enters 
"a theater, was a"
cquainted with 
"everybody, equal"
ly pleased to se
"e everyone, and "
equally indiffer
ent to them all
. Sometimes he j
oined in a conve
rsation which in
terested him an
"d, regardless of"
 whether any “
gentlemen of the
 embassy” were
 present or not
", lispingly expr"
"essed his views,"
 which were some
times not at al
l in accord with
 the accepted to
ne of the moment
. But the genera
l opinion conce
rning the queer 
husband of “th
e most distingui
shed woman in P
etersburg” was
 so well establi
shed that no one
 took his freaks
 seriously.  
Among the many y
oung men who fre
quented her hous
"e every day, Bor"
ís Drubetskóy
", who had alread"
y achieved great
 success in the 
"service, was
th"
e most intimate 
friend of the Be
zúkhov househol
d since Hélène
’s return fro
m Erfurt. Hélè
ne spoke of him 
as “mon page�
� and treated h
im like a child.
 Her smile for h
im was the same 
as for everybody
",
but sometimes"
 that smile made
 Pierre uncomfor
table. Toward hi
m Borís behave
d with a particu
larly dignified 
and sad deferenc
e. This shade o
f deference also
 disturbed Pierr
e. He had suffer
ed so painfully 
three years bef
ore from the mor
tification to wh
ich his wife had
 subjected him 
that he now prot
ected himself fr
om the danger of
" its repetition,"
 first by not b
eing a husband t
"o his wife, and "
secondly by not 
allowing himself
 to suspect.  
"
“No, now that"
 she has become 
a bluestocking s
he has finally r
enounced her fo
rmer infatuation
"s,” he told hi"
mself. “There 
has never been 
an instance of a
 bluestocking be
ing carried away
 by affairs of t
he heart”—a
 statement which
", though gathere"
d from an unknow
"n source,
he be"
lieved implicitl
y. Yet strange t
o say Borís’ 
presence in his 
 wife’s drawin
g room (and he w
as almost always
 there) had a ph
ysical effect u
pon Pierre; it c
onstricted his l
imbs and destroy
ed the unconsci
ousness and free
dom of his movem
ents.  “What
 a strange antip
"athy,” thought"
" Pierre, “yet "
I used to like 
him very much.�
�  In the eyes
 of the world Pi
erre was a great
" gentleman, the "
rather blind an
d absurd husband
 of a distinguis
"hed wife, a clev"
er crank who did
 nothing but ha
rmed nobody and 
was a first-rate
", good-natured f"
ellow. But a co
mplex and diffic
ult process of i
nternal developm
ent was taking p
lace all this t
ime in Pierre’
"s soul, revealin"
g much to him an
d causing him m
any spiritual do
ubts and joys.

"ot up at eight, "
read the Scriptu

 Joseph Alexée
vich’s advice 
Pierre had enter

 served on one o
f the committees
.) Returned home
 for dinner and 
dined alone—t
he countess had 
many visitors I 
do not like. I a
te and drank mo
derately and aft
er dinner copied
 out some passag

 to the countess
 and told a funn
y story about B

27th November  
 I got up late. 
On waking I lay 
long in bed yiel
ding to sloth. O
" God,
help and "
strengthen me th
at I may walk in
 Thy ways! Read 
"the Scriptures,"
 but without pro
per feeling. Bro
ther Urúsov cam
e and we talked 
about worldly v
anities. He told
 me of the Emper
or’s new proje
cts. I began to
" criticize them,"
 but remembered 
my rules and my 
benefactor’s 
words—that a t
rue Freemason sh
ould be a zealou
s worker for the
 state when his
 aid is required
 and a quiet onl
ooker when not c
alled on to ass
ist. My tongue i
s my enemy. Brot
hers G. V. and O
. visited me and
 we had a preli
minary talk abou
t the reception 
of a new Brother
. They laid on 
me the duty of R
hetor. I feel my
self weak and un
worthy. Then our
 talk turned to
 the interpretat
ion of the seven
 pillars and ste
ps of the Templ
"e, the seven sci"
"ences, the seven"
" virtues, the se"
"ven vices, and t"
he seven gifts 
of the Holy Spir
it. Brother O. w
as very eloquent
. In the evenin
g the admission 
took place. The 
new decoration o
f the Premises 
contributed much
 to the magnific
ence of the spec
tacle. It was Bo
rís Drubetskó
y who was admitt
ed. I nominated 
him and was the 
Rhetor. A stran
ge feeling agita
ted me all the t
ime I was alone 
with him in the 
 dark chamber. I
 caught myself h
arboring a feeli
ng of hatred tow
ard him which I
 vainly tried to
 overcome. That 
is why I should 
really like to 
save him from ev
il and lead him 
into the path of
" truth, but evil"
 thoughts of hi
m did not leave 
me. It seemed to
 me that his obj
ect in entering

 3rd December  
"
Awoke late, rea"
d the Scriptures
 but was apathet
ic. Afterwards w
ent and paced u
p and down the l
arge hall. I wis
"hed to meditate,"
 but instead my 
 imagination pic
tured an occurre
nce of four year
"s ago, when Dól"
"okhov,
meeting "
me in Moscow aft
"er our duel, sai"
d he hoped I was
 enjoying perfe
ct peace of mind
 in spite of my 
wife’s absence
. At the time I 
 gave him no ans
wer. Now I recal
led every detail
 of that meeting
 and in my mind
 gave him the mo
st malevolent an
d bitter replies
. I recollected 
 myself and drov
e away that thou
ght only when I 
found myself glo
wing with anger
", but I did not "
sufficiently rep
ent. Afterwards 
Borís Drubetsk�
�y came and beg
an relating vari
ous adventures. 
His coming vexed
 me from the fi
"rst, and I said "
something disagr
eeable to him. H
e replied. I fla
red up and said
 much that was u
npleasant and ev
en rude to him. 
He became silen
"t, and I recolle"
cted myself only
 when it was too
" late. My God, I"
 cannot get on 
with him at all.
 The cause of th
is is my egotism
. I set myself 
above him and so
 become much wor
"se than he, for "
he is lenient t
o my rudeness wh
ile I on the con
trary nourish co
ntempt for him. 
"O God,
grant th"
at in his presen
ce I may rather 
see my own vilen
"ess, and behave"
 so that he too 
may benefit. Aft
er dinner I fell
 asleep and as I
 was drowsing o
ff I clearly hea
rd a voice sayin
g in my left ear
", “Thy
day!�"
�  I dreamed t
hat I was walkin
g in the dark an
d was suddenly s
urrounded by do
"gs, but I went o"
n undismayed. Su
ddenly a smallis
h dog seized my 
left thigh with
 its teeth and w
ould not let go.
 I began to thro
ttle it with my
 hands. Scarcely
 had I torn it o
ff before anothe
"r, a bigger one,"
 began biting m
e. I lifted it u
"p, but the highe"
r I lifted it th
e bigger and he
avier it grew. A
nd suddenly Brot
"her A. came and,"
" taking my arm, "
led me to a bui
lding to enter w
hich we had to p
ass along a narr
ow plank. I ste
"pped on it, but "
it bent and gave
 way and I began
 to clamber up a
 fence which I 
could scarcely r
each with my han
ds. After much e
ffort I dragged
" myself up, so t"
hat my leg hung 
down on one side
 and my body on 
 the other. I lo
oked round and s
aw Brother A. st
anding on the fe
nce and pointin
g me to a broad 
avenue and garde
"n, and in the ga"
rden was a large
 and beautiful 
building. I woke
" up. O Lord, gre"
at Architect of 
"Nature,
help me"
 to tear from my
self these dogs�
��my passions es
pecially the la
"st, which unites"
 in itself the s
trength of all t
"he former ones, "
and aid me to e
nter that temple
 of virtue to a 
vision of which 
I attained in m
y dream.   7t
h December  I 
dreamed that Jos
eph Alexéevich 
was sitting in m
"y house, and tha"
t I was very gl
ad and wished to
 entertain him. 
It seemed as if 
I chattered inc
essantly with ot
her people and s
uddenly remember
ed that this cou
ld not please h
"im, and I wished"
 to come close t
o him and embrac
e him. But as s
oon as I drew ne
ar I saw that hi
s face had chang
ed and grown you
"ng,
and he was "
quietly telling 
me something abo
ut the teaching 
"of our order,
b"
ut so softly tha
t I could not he
ar it. Then it s
eemed that we al
l left the room
 and something s
trange happened.
 We were sitting
 or lying on th
e floor. He was 
telling me somet
"hing, and I wish"
ed to show him m
"y
sensibility, "
and not listenin
g to what he was
 saying I began 
picturing to my
self the conditi
on of my inner m
an and the grace
 of God sanctify
ing me. And tea
rs came into my 
"eyes, and I was "
glad he noticed 
this. But he lo
oked at me with 
vexation and jum
"ped up, breaking"
 off his remarks
. I felt abashe
d and asked whet
her what he had 
been saying did 
not concern me;
 but he did not 
"reply, gave me a"
" kind look, and "
then we suddenly
 found ourselve
s in my bedroom 
where there is a
 double bed. He 
lay down on the
 edge of it and 
I burned with lo
nging to caress 
him and lie down
 too. And he sa
"id, “Tell me f"
rankly what is y
our chief tempta
tion? Do you kn
ow it? I think y
ou know it alrea
dy.” Abashed b
"y this question,"
 I replied that
 sloth was my ch
ief temptation. 
He shook his hea
d incredulously
; and even more 
"abashed, I said "
that though I wa
s living with m
y wife as he adv
"ised, I was not "
living with her 
as her husband. 
To this he repl
ied that one sho
uld not deprive 
a wife of one’
s embraces and 
gave me to under
stand that that 
was my duty. But
 I replied that 
 I should be ash
"amed to do it, a"
nd suddenly ever
ything vanished.
 And I awoke an
d found in my mi
nd the text from
 the Gospel: “
The life was th
e light of men. 
And the light sh
ineth in darknes
s; and the darkn
ess comprehende
d it not.” Jos
eph Alexéevich�
��s face had loo
ked young and b
right. That day 
I received a let
ter from my bene
factor in which 
he wrote about 
“conjugal duti
es.”   9th 
December  I ha
d a dream from w
hich I awoke wit
h a throbbing he
art. I saw that 
 I was in Moscow
" in my house, in"
 the big sitting
" room, and Josep"
h Alexéevich c
ame in from the 
drawing room. I 
seemed to know a
t once that the
 process of rege
neration had alr
eady taken place
" in him, and I r"
ushed to meet h
im. I embraced h
im and kissed hi
"s hands, and he "
"said, “Hast
t"
hou noticed that
 my face is diff
erent?” I look
"ed at him, still"
 holding him in
" my arms, and sa"
w that his face 
"was young, but t"
hat he had no h
air on his head 
and his features
 were quite chan
"ged. And I said,"
 “I should ha
ve known you had
 I met you by ch
"ance,” and I t"
hought to mysel
"f, “Am I telli"
ng the truth?”
 And suddenly I 
saw him lying li
ke a dead body;
 then he gradual
ly recovered and
 went with me in
to my study car
rying a large bo
ok of sheets of 
drawing paper; I
" said, “I drew"
"
that,” and h"
e answered by bo
wing his head. I
 opened the book
", and on
all th"
e pages there we
re excellent dra
wings. And in my
 dream I knew t
hat these drawin
gs represented t
he love adventur
es of the soul w
ith its beloved
. And on its pag
es I saw a beaut
iful representat
ion of a maiden 
 in transparent 
garments and wit
h a transparent 
"body, flying up "
to the clouds. 
And I seemed to 
know that this m
aiden was nothin
g else than a r
epresentation of
 the Song of Son
gs. And looking 
at those drawing
s I dreamed I f
elt that I was d
"oing wrong, but "
could not tear m
yself away from
" them. Lord, hel"
"p me! My God, if"
 Thy forsaking m
"e is Thy doing, "
Thy will be don
e; but if I am m
"yself the cause,"
 teach me what I
 should do! I s
hall perish of m
y debauchery if 
Thou utterly des
ertest me!   
   CHAPTER XI
  The Rostóvs
’ monetary aff
airs had not imp
roved during the
 two years they
 had spent in th
e country.  Th
ough Nicholas Ro
stóv had kept f
irmly to his res
olution and was 
still serving m
odestly in an ob
"scure regiment, "
spending compara
"tively little,
"
the way of life 
at Otrádnoe—M
ítenka’s mana
gement of affair
"s, in
particula"
r—was such tha
t the debts inev
itably increased
 every year. Th
e only resource 
obviously presen
ting itself to t
he old count was
 to apply for a
"n official post,"
 so he had come 
to Petersburg to
 look for one a
"nd also, as he s"
"aid, to let the "
lassies enjoy th
emselves for the
 last time.  
Soon after their
 arrival in Pete
rsburg Berg prop
osed to Véra an
d was accepted.
  Though in Mo
scow the Rostóv
s belonged to th
e best society w
ithout themselv
es giving it a t
"hought, yet in P"
etersburg their 
circle of acqua
intances was a m
ixed and indefin
ite one. In Pete
rsburg they were
"
provincials, a"
nd the very peop
le they had ente
rtained in Mosco
w without inqui
ring to what set
" they belonged, "
here looked down
 on them.  The
 Rostóvs lived 
in the same hosp
itable way in Pe
tersburg as in 
"Moscow, and the "
most diverse peo
ple met at their
 suppers. Countr
y neighbors fro
"m Otrádnoe, imp"
overished old sq
uires and their 
"daughters,
Per�"
�nskaya a maid o
"f honor, Pierre "
"Bezúkhov, and t"
he son of their 
 district postma
ster who had obt
ained a post in 
Petersburg. Amon
g the men who v
ery soon became 
frequent visitor
s at the Rostóv
s’ house in P
etersburg were B
"orís, Pierre wh"
om the count had
 met in the stre
et and dragged 
"home with him, a"
nd Berg who spen
t whole days at 
the Rostóvs’ 
 and paid the el
"dest daughter, C"
"ountess Véra, t"
he attentions a 
young man pays 
when he intends 
to propose.  N
ot in vain had B
erg shown everyb
ody his right ha
nd wounded at A
usterlitz and he
ld a perfectly u
nnecessary sword
 in his left. He
 narrated that 
episode so persi
stently and with
 so important an
 air that every
one believed in 
the merit and us
efulness of his 
"deed, and he had"
 obtained two d
ecorations for A
usterlitz.  In
 the Finnish war
 he also managed
 to distinguish 
himself. He had 
picked up the s
crap of a grenad
e that had kille
d an aide-de-cam
p standing near 
 the commander i
n chief and had 
taken it to his 
commander. Just 
as he had done 
after Austerlitz
", he related thi"
s occurrence at 
such length and 
 so insistently 
that everyone ag
ain believed it 
had been necessa
"ry to do
this, "
and he received 
two decorations 
for the Finnish 
war also. In 18
09 he was a capt
ain in the Guard
"s, wore medals, "
and held some sp
ecial lucrative
 posts in Peters
burg.  Though 
some skeptics sm
iled when told o
f Berg’s merit
"s, it could not"
 be denied that 
he was a painsta
king and brave o
"fficer, on excel"
lent terms with
" his superiors, "
and a moral youn
g man with a bri
lliant career b
efore him and an
 assured positio
n in society.  
 Four years befo
"re, meeting a Ge"
rman comrade in 
the stalls of a 
"Moscow
theater,"
 Berg had pointe
d out Véra Rost
óva to him and 
had said in Ger
"man, “das soll"
 mein Weib werde
"n,” * and from"
 that moment had
 made up his mi
nd to marry her.
 Now in Petersbu
"rg, having consi"
dered the Rost�
�vs’ position 
"and his own, he "
decided that the
 time had come t
o propose.   
   * “That gir
l shall be my wi
fe.”   Berg
’s proposal wa
s at first recei
ved with a perpl
exity that was n
ot flattering t
o him. At first 
it seemed strang
e that the son o
f an obscure Li
vonian gentleman
 should propose 
marriage to a Co
untess Rostóva;
 but Berg’s c
hief characteris
tic was such a n
aïve and good n
atured egotism 
that the Rostóv
s involuntarily 
came to think it
 would be a good
" thing,
since h"
e himself was so
 firmly convince
d that it was go
"od, indeed
exce"
"llent. Moreover,"
 the Rostóvs’
 affairs were se
riously embarras
"sed,
as the sui"
tor could not bu
t know; and abov
"e all, Véra was"
" twenty-four,
h"
ad been taken ou
"t everywhere, an"
d though she was
 certainly good-
looking and sen
"sible, no one up"
 to now had prop
osed to her. So 
they gave their 
 consent.  “
"You see,” said"
 Berg to his com
"rade, whom he ca"
lled “friend�
� only because 
he knew that eve
ryone has friend
"s, “you see, I"
 have considere
"d it all, and sh"
ould not marry i
f I had not thou
ght it all out 
or if it were in
 any way unsuita
ble. But on the 
"contrary, my pap"
a and mamma are
 now provided fo
r—I have arran
ged that rent fo
r them in the B
altic Provinces�
��and I can live
 in Petersburg o
"n my pay, and wi"
th her fortune 
and my good mana
gement we can ge
t along nicely. 
I am not marryi
ng for money—I
 consider that d
ishonorable—bu
t a wife should 
 bring her share
 and a husband h
is. I have my po
sition in the se
"rvice,
she has "
connections and 
some means. In o
ur times that is
 worth somethin
"g, isn’t it? B"
"ut above all, sh"
"e is a handsome,"
" estimable girl,"
 and she loves 
me....”  Ber
g blushed and sm
iled.  “And 
"I love her, beca"
use her characte
r is sensible an
d very good. No
w the other sist
"er, though they "
are the same fam
"ily, is quite
d"
ifferent—an un
pleasant charact
er and has not t
he same intellig
ence. She is so
... you know?...
 Unpleasant... B
ut my fiancée!.
".. Well, you
wi"
"ll be coming,”"
 he was going to
" say, “to dine"
",” but changed"
 his mind and s
aid “to take t
"ea with us,” a"
nd quickly doubl
ing up his tong
ue he blew a sma
ll round ring of
" tobacco smoke, "
perfectly embody
ing his dream o
f happiness.  
After the first 
feeling of perpl
exity aroused in
 the parents by 
Berg’s propos
"al, the holiday "
tone of joyousne
ss usual at such
 times took pos
session of the f
"amily, but the r"
ejoicing was ext
ernal and insinc
ere. In the fam
ily’s feeling 
toward this wedd
ing a certain aw
kwardness and c
onstraint was ev
"ident, as if the"
y were ashamed o
f not having lov
ed Véra suffic
iently and of be
ing so ready to 
get her off thei
r hands. The ol
d count felt thi
s most. He would
 probably have b
een unable to st
ate the cause o
f his embarrassm
"ent, but it resu"
lted from the st
ate of his affa
irs. He did not 
know at all how 
"much he had, wha"
t his debts amou
"nted
to, or wha"
t dowry he could
 give Véra. Whe
n his daughters 
were born he ha
d assigned to ea
"ch of them, for "
"her dowry, an es"
tate with three 
 hundred serfs; 
but one of these
 estates had alr
"eady been sold, "
and the other w
as mortgaged and
 the interest so
 much in arrears
 that it would 
"have to be sold,"
 so that it was 
impossible to gi
ve it to Véra. 
Nor had he any 
money.  Berg h
ad already been 
"engaged a month,"
 and only a week
 remained before
"
the wedding, b"
ut the count had
 not yet decided
 in his own mind
 the question o
"f the dowry, nor"
 spoken to his w
ife about it. At
 one time the c
ount thought of 
giving her the R
yazán estate or
 of selling a fo
"rest,
at anothe"
r time of borrow
ing money on a n
ote of hand. A f
ew days before 
the wedding Berg
 entered the cou
nt’s study ear
ly one morning a
"nd, with
a plea"
"sant smile, resp"
ectfully asked h
is future father
-in-law to let 
him know what V�
�ra’s dowry wo
uld be. The coun
t was so disconc
erted by this l
ong-foreseen inq
uiry that withou
t consideration 
he gave the firs
t reply that ca
me into his head
. “I like your
 being businessl
ike about it...
. I like it. You
 shall be satisf
ied....”  An
d patting Berg o
n the shoulder h
"e got up, wishin"
g to end the co
nversation. But 
"Berg, smiling pl"
"easantly, explai"
ned that if he d
id not know for
 certain how muc
h Véra would ha
ve and did not r
eceive at least 
 part of the dow
"ry in advance, h"
e would have to 
break matters of
f.  “Because
", consider, Coun"
t—if I allowed
 myself to marry
 now without ha
ving definite me
ans to maintain 
"my wife, I shoul"
d be acting bad
ly....”  The
 conversation en
ded by the count
", who wished to "
be generous and 
to avoid furthe
"r importunity, s"
aying that he wo
uld give a note 
of hand for eig
hty thousand rub
les. Berg smiled
" meekly, kissed "
the count on the
"
shoulder, and "
said that he was
" very grateful, "
but that it was 
impossible for 
him to arrange h
is new life with
out receiving th
irty thousand in
 ready money. �
��Or at least tw
"enty thousand, C"
"ount,” he adde"
"d, “and
then "
a note of hand f
or only sixty th
ousand.”  �
"�Yes, yes, all r"
ight!” said th
e count hurriedl
y. “Only excus
"e me,

"s well. Yes, yes"
! Kiss me.”  
     CHAPTER
 XII  Natásha
 was sixteen and
 it was the year
" 1809, the very "
year to which s
he had counted o
n her fingers wi
th Borís after 
they had kissed 
four years ago.
 Since then she 
had not seen him
. Before Sónya 
"and her
mother,"
 if Borís happe
ned to be mentio
"ned, she spoke q"
uite freely of 
that episode as 
of some childish
", long-forgotten"
 matter that was
 not worth ment
ioning. But in t
he secret depths
 of her soul the
 question wheth
er her engagemen
t to Borís was 
a jest or an imp
"ortant, binding"
 promise torment
ed her.  Since
 Borís left Mos
cow in 1805 to j
oin the army he 
had not seen the
 Rostóvs. He h
ad been in Mosco
"w several times,"
 and had passed 
"near
Otrádnoe,"
 but had never b
een to see them.
  Sometimes it
 occurred to Nat
ásha that he di
d not wish to se
"e her, and
this"
 conjecture was 
confirmed by the
 sad tone in whi
ch her elders sp
oke of him.  
“Nowadays old 
friends are not 
"remembered,” t"
he countess woul
d say when Bor�
�s was mentioned
.  Anna Mikhá
ylovna also had 
of late visited 
them less freque
"ntly, seemed
to"
 hold herself wi
th particular di
"gnity, and alway"
s spoke rapturou
sly and gratefu
lly of the merit
s of her son and
 the brilliant c
areer on which 
he had entered. 
When the Rostóv
s came to Peters
burg Borís call
ed on them.  
He drove to thei
r house in some 
agitation. The m
emory of Natásh
a was his most 
poetic recollect
ion. But he went
 with the firm i
ntention of let
ting her and her
 parents feel th
at the childish 
relations betwee
n himself and N
atásha could no
t be binding eit
her on her or on
 him. He had a 
brilliant positi
on in society th
anks to his inti
macy with Counte
"ss
Bezúkhova, "
a brilliant posi
tion in the serv
ice thanks to th
e patronage of 
an important per
sonage whose com
plete confidence
" he enjoyed, and"
 he was beginni
ng to make plans
 for marrying on
e of the richest
 heiresses in P
"etersburg, plans"
 which might ver
y easily be real
ized. When he en
tered the Rost�
�vs’ drawing r
oom Natásha was
 in her own room
. When she hear
d of his arrival
 she almost ran 
into the drawing
" room, flushed a"
nd beaming with
 a more than cor
dial smile.  B
orís remembered
 Natásha in a s
"hort dress, with"
 dark eyes shini
ng from under h
er curls and boi
"sterous, childis"
"h laughter, as h"
e had known her 
 four years befo
re; and so he wa
s taken aback wh
en quite a diffe
rent Natásha e
"ntered, and his "
face expressed r
apturous astonis
hment. This exp
ression on his f
ace pleased Nat�
�sha.  “Well
", do you recogni"
ze your little m
adcap playmate?�
�� asked the co
untess.  Borí
s kissed Natásh
a’s hand and s
aid that he was 
astonished at th

.  “How hand
some you have gr
own!”  “I 
should think so!
” replied Nat�
�sha’s laughin
g eyes.  “An
d is Papa older?
” she asked. 
 Natásha sat d
"own and, without"
 joining in Bor�
�s’ conversati
on with the cou
"ntess, silently "
and minutely stu
died her childho
od’s suitor. H
e felt the weig
ht of that resol
ute and affectio
nate scrutiny an
d glanced at he
r occasionally. 
  Borís’ uni
"form, spurs, tie"
", and the way hi"
s hair was brush
ed were all com
me il faut and i
n the latest fas
hion. This Natá
sha noticed at o
nce. He sat rat
her sideways in 
the armchair nex
t to the countes
"s, arranging
wi"
th his right han
d the cleanest o
f gloves that fi
tted his left ha
"nd
like a skin,"
 and he spoke wi
th a particularl
y refined compre
ssion of his li
ps about the amu
sements of the h
ighest Petersbur
"g society, recal"
ling with mild 
irony old times 
in Moscow and Mo
scow acquaintanc
es. It was not 
"accidentally, Na"
"tásha felt, tha"
"t he alluded, wh"
en speaking of t
he highest aris
"tocracy, to an a"
mbassador’s ba
ll he had attend
"ed, and to
invi"
tations he had r
eceived from N.N
. and S.S.  Al
l this time Nat�
"�sha sat silent,"
 glancing up at 
him from under h
er brows. This 
gaze disturbed a
nd confused Bor�
�s more and more
. He looked rou
nd more frequent
"ly toward her, a"
nd broke off in 
what he was sayi
ng. He did not 
stay more than t
"en minutes, then"
 rose and took h
is leave. The s
"ame inquisitive,"
" challenging, an"
d rather mocking
 eyes still look
ed at him. Afte
r his first visi
t Borís said to
 himself that Na
tásha attracte
d him just as mu
"ch as ever, but "
that he must not
 yield to that 
"feeling, because"
" to marry her, a"
 girl almost wit
"hout fortune, wo"
uld mean ruin t
"o his career, wh"
ile to renew the
ir former relati
ons without int
ending to marry 
her would be dis
honorable. Borí
s made up his mi
nd to avoid mee
"ting Natásha, b"
ut despite that 
resolution he ca
lled again a fe
w days later and
 began calling o
ften and spendin
g whole days at 
the Rostóvs’
. It seemed to h
im that he ought
 to have an expl
anation with Na
tásha and tell 
her that the old
 times must be f
"orgotten, that i"
n spite of ever
ything... she co
uld not be his w
"ife, that he had"
" no means,
and "
they would never
 let her marry h
im. But he faile
d to do so and f
elt awkward abo
ut entering on s
uch an explanati
on. From day to 
day he became m
ore and more ent
angled. It seeme
d to her mother 
and Sónya that 
 Natásha was in
 love with Borí
s as of old. She
 sang him his fa
"vorite
songs, s"
howed him her al
"bum, making him "
"write in it, did"
 not allow him 
to allude to the
" past, letting i"
t be understood 
how delightful w
as the present;
 and every day h
e went away in a
" fog, without ha"
ving said what 
"he meant to, and"
 not knowing wha
t he was doing o
"r why he came, o"
r how it would 
all end. He left
 off visiting H�
�lène and recei
ved reproachful 
 notes from her 
"every day, and y"
et he continued 
to spend whole d
ays with the Ro
stóvs.     
  CHAPTER XIII 
  One night whe
n the old counte
"ss, in nightcap "
and dressing jac
"ket,
without he"
"r false curls, a"
nd with her poor
 little knob of 
hair showing un
der her white co
"tton cap, knelt "
sighing and groa
ning on a rug an
d bowing to the
 ground in praye
"r, her door crea"
ked and Natásha
", also in
a dre"
ssing jacket wit
h slippers on he
r bare feet and 
her hair in cur
"lpapers, ran in."
 The countess—
her prayerful mo
od dispelled—l
ooked round and
 frowned. She wa
s finishing her 
last prayer: “
Can it be that 
this couch will 
be my grave?” 
"Natásha, flushe"
"d and eager, see"
ing her mother 
"in prayer, sudde"
nly checked her 
"rush, half sat d"
"own, and
uncons"
ciously put out 
her tongue as if
 chiding herself
. Seeing that h
er mother was st
ill praying she 
ran on tiptoe to
" the bed and, ra"
pidly slipping 
one little foot 
against the othe
"r, pushed off he"
r slippers and 
jumped onto the 
bed the countess
 had feared migh
t become her gra
ve. This couch 
"was high, with a"
 feather bed and
 five pillows ea
ch smaller than 
 the one below. 
Natásha jumped 
"on it, sank into"
 the feather bed
", rolled
over t"
"o the wall, and "
began snuggling 
up the bedclothe
s as she settled
"
down, raising "
her knees to her
" chin, kicking o"
ut and laughing 
almost inaudibl
"y, now covering "
herself up head 
"and all, and now"
 peeping at her 
 mother. The cou
ntess finished h
er prayers and c
ame to the bed w
ith a stern fac
"e, but seeing th"
at Natásha’s 
head was covered
", she smiled
in"
" her kind, weak "
way.  “Now t
"hen, now then!�"
� said she.  �
"��Mamma, can we "
have a talk? Yes
?” said Natás
"ha. “Now, just"
 one on your th
roat and another
... that’ll do
!” And seizing
 her mother roun
"d
the neck, she"
 kissed her on t
he throat. In he
r behavior to he
r mother Natás
"ha seemed rough,"
 but she was so 
sensitive and ta
ctful that howev
er she clasped 
her mother she a
lways managed to
 do it without h
urting her or m
aking her feel u
ncomfortable or 
displeased.  �
"��Well, what is "
it tonight?” s
"aid the mother, "
having arranged 
her pillows and
 waited until Na
"tásha, after tu"
rning over a cou
"ple of times,
h"
ad settled down 
beside her under
" the quilt, spre"
"ad out her arms,"
 and assumed a 
serious expressi
on.  These vis
its of Natásha�
��s at night bef
ore the count re
turned from his 
 club were one o
f the greatest p
leasures of both
" mother, and dau"
ghter.  “Wha
t is it tonight?
—But I have to
 tell you...” 
  Natásha put 
her hand on her 
mother’s mouth
.  “About Bo
"rís... I know,�"
�� she said seri
ously; “that�
�s what I have 
come about. Don�
��t say it—I k
"now. No, do tell"
 me!” and she 
 removed her han
"d. “Tell me, M"
amma! He’s nic
e?”  “Nat�
"�sha, you are si"
xteen. At your a
ge I was married
. You say Borís
 is nice. He is
" very nice, and "
I love him like 
a son. But what 
then?... What a
re you thinking 
about? You have 
quite turned his
" head, I can see"
 that....”  
 As she said thi
s the countess l
ooked round at h
er daughter. Nat
ásha was lying
 looking steadil
y straight befor
e her at one of 
the mahogany sp
hinxes carved on
 the corners of 
"the bedstead, so"
 that the counte
ss only saw her
 daughter’s fa
ce in profile. T
hat face struck 
her by its pecu
liarly serious a
nd concentrated 
expression.  N
atásha was list
ening and consid
ering.  “Wel
"l, what then?”"
 said she.  �
�You have quite 
"turned his head,"
 and why? What d
o you want of hi
m? You know you
 can’t marry h
im.”  “Why
 not?” said Na
"tásha, without "
changing her pos
ition.  “Bec
ause he is young
", because he is "
"poor, because he"
 is a relation..
. and because y
ou yourself don�
��t love him.”
  “How do yo
u know?”  �
�I know. It is n
"ot right, darlin"
g!”  “But 
if I want to...�
�� said Natásha
.  “Leave of
f talking nonsen
"se,” said the "
countess.  “
But if I want to
...”  “Nat
"ásha, I am in e"
arnest...”  
Natásha did not
 let her finish.
 She drew the co
untess’ large 
"hand to
her, ki"
ssed it on the b
ack and then on 
"the palm, then a"
gain turned it 
over and began k
issing first one
" knuckle, then t"
he space between
" the
knuckles, "
then the next kn
"uckle, whisperin"
"g, “January, F"
"ebruary,
March,"
" April, May. Spe"
"ak, Mamma, why d"
on’t you say a
nything? Speak!�
"��
said she, tu"
rning to her mot
"her, who was ten"
derly gazing at 
her daughter an
d in that contem
plation seemed t
o have forgotten
 all she had wis
hed to say.  
“It won’t do
", my love! Not e"
veryone will und
erstand this fri
endship dating 
from your childi
"sh days, and to "
see him so intim
ate with you may
 injure you in 
the eyes of othe
r young men who 
"visit us, and ab"
ove all it torm
ents him for not
hing. He may alr
eady have found 
a suitable and 
"wealthy match, a"
nd now he’s ha
lf crazy.”  
“Crazy?” rep
eated Natásha. 
  “I’ll tel
l you some thing
s about myself. 
I had a cousin..
.”  “I kno
w! Cyril Matvéi
ch... but he is 
old.”  “He
 was not always 
old. But this is
" what I’ll do,"
" Natásha, I’l"
l have a talk w
ith Borís. He n
eed not come so 
often....”  
"“Why not, if h"
e likes to?” 
 “Because I k
now it will end 
in nothing....�
�  “How can 
"you know? No, Ma"
"mma, don’t spe"
ak to him! What 
nonsense!” sa
id Natásha in t
he tone of one b
eing deprived of
 her property. 
"“Well, I won�"
"�t marry, but le"
t him come if he
 enjoys it and I
 enjoy it.” N
atásha smiled a
nd looked at her
 mother. “Not 
"to marry, but
j"
"ust so,” she a"
dded.  “How 
"so, my pet?”
"
 “Just so. Th
ere’s no need 
for me to marry 
him. But... just
 so.”  “Ju
"st so, just so,�"
�� repeated the 
"countess, and sh"
"aking all over, "
she went off in
to a good humore
"d, unexpected, e"
lderly laugh.  
 “Don’t laug
"h, stop!” crie"
d Natásha. “Y
ou’re shaking 
the whole bed! 
You’re awfully
" like me, just s"
uch another gigg

�Little countess

from behind the 
door. “You’

� Natásha jumpe
"d up, snatched u"
"p her slippers,"
 and ran barefoo
t to her own roo
m.  It was a l
ong time before 
she could sleep.
 She kept thinki
ng that no one 
could understand
 all that she un
derstood and all
 there was in he
r.  “Sónya?
"” she thought,"
 glancing at tha

" on, speaking
o"
f herself in the
" third person, a"
nd imagining it 
was some very wi

sest and best of
 men—who was s
aying it of her.
 “There is ev

he hummed a scra

 passed into yet
 another happier
 world of dream

ing was as light
 and beautiful a
"s in

nd even more so 
because it was d
ifferent.  Nex
t day the counte

 aside and had a

after which he 
ceased coming to

PTER XIV  On t

"of December, New"
" Year’s Eve, 1"
809 - 10 an old 
 grandee of Cath
erine’s day wa
s giving a ball 
and midnight sup
per. The diplom
atic corps and t
he Emperor himse
lf were to be pr
esent.  The gr
andee’s well-k
nown mansion on 
the English Quay
 glittered with 
 innumerable lig
hts. Police were
 stationed at th
e brightly lit e
ntrance which w
as carpeted with
" red baize, and "
not only gendarm
es but dozens of
 police officer
s and even the p
olice master him
self stood at th
e porch. Carria
ges kept driving
 away and fresh 
"ones arriving, w"
ith red-liveried
 footmen and fo
otmen in plumed 
hats. From the c
arriages emerged
 men wearing un
"iforms, stars, a"
"nd ribbons, whil"
e ladies in sati

utiously descend
ed the carriage 
steps which were
 let down for th
em with a clatt

ked hurriedly an
d noiselessly ov

 the entrance. 
 Almost every t

" than the rest, "
seemed to know e
veryone and men
tioned by name t

ay.  A third o
f the visitors h
ad already arriv
"ed, but the Rost"
"óvs, who were
"
"to be present, w"
ere still hurryi
ng to get dresse
d.  There had 
been many discus
sions and prepar
ations for this 
ball in the Ros
"tóv family, man"
y fears that the
 invitation woul
"d not arrive, th"
at the dresses 
would not be rea
"dy, or that some"
thing would not 
be arranged as 
it should be.  
 Márya Ignátev

a thin and shall

 at the court o
f the Dowager Em
"press, who was a"
 friend and rela
tion of the cou
ntess and pilote
d the provincial
 Rostóvs in Pet
ersburg high soc
"iety,
was to ac"
company them to 
the ball.  The
y were to call f
or her at her ho
use in the Tauri
da Gardens at te
"n
o’clock, bu"
t it was already
 five minutes to
" ten, and the gi"
rls were not ye
t dressed.  Na
tásha was going
 to her first gr
and ball. She ha
d got up at eigh
t that morning 
and had been in 
a fever of excit
ement and activi
ty all day. All 
 her powers sinc
e morning had be
en concentrated 
on ensuring that
 they all—she
" herself, Mamma,"
 and Sónya—sh
ould be as well 
dressed as poss
ible. Sónya and
 her mother put 
themselves entir
ely in her hands
. The countess 
was to wear a cl
aret-colored vel
"vet dress, and t"
he two girls wh
ite gauze over p
"ink silk slips, "
with roses on th
eir bodices and 
 their hair dres
sed à la grecqu
e.  Everything
 essential had a
lready been done
"; feet, hands, n"
"ecks, and
ears "
"washed, perfumed"
", and powdered, "
as befits a ball
; the openwork 
silk stockings a
nd white satin s
hoes with ribbon
s were already o
n; the hairdres
sing was almost 
done. Sónya was
 finishing dress
ing and so was 
"the countess, bu"
"t Natásha, who "
had bustled abou
t helping them a
"ll, was
behindh"
and. She was sti
ll sitting befor
e a looking-glas
s with a dressin
g jacket thrown
 over her slende
r shoulders. Só
nya stood ready 
dressed in the 
middle of the ro
"om and, pressing"
 the head of a p
in till it hurt 
her dainty fing
"er, was fixing o"
n a last ribbon 
that squeaked as
 the pin went t
hrough it.  �
�That’s not th
"e way, that’s "
"not the way, Só"
nya!” cried Na
tásha turning 
her head and clu
tching with both
 hands at her ha
ir which the ma
id who was dress
ing it had not t
ime to release. 
“That bow is n
ot right. Come 
here!”  Són
ya sat down and 
Natásha pinned 
the ribbon on di
fferently.  �
"�Allow me, Miss!"
 I can’t do it
" like that,” s"
aid the maid who
 was holding Na
tásha’s hair.
"

“Oh, dear!"
" Well then, wait"
. That’s right
", Sónya.”

"
“Aren’t you 
ready? It is nea
"rly ten,” came"
 the countess’
 voice.  “Di
rectly! Directly
"! And you, Mamma"
?”  “I hav
e only my cap to
 pin on.”  �
��Don’t do it 
without me!” c
alled Natásha. 
“You won’t d
o it right.” 
  “But it’s
 already ten.”
  They had dec
ided to be at th
e ball by half-p
"ast ten, and Nat"
ásha had still
 to get dressed 
and they had to 
call at the Taur
ida Gardens.  
When her hair wa
"s done, Natásha"
", in her short p"
etticoat from un
der which her d
ancing shoes sho
"wed, and in her "
mother’s dress
"ing jacket,
ran"
" up to Sónya, s"
"crutinized her, "
and then ran to 
her mother. Turn
ing her mother�
��s head this wa
"y and that, she "
fastened on the 
"cap and,
hurrie"
dly kissing her 
"gray hair, ran b"
ack to the maids
 who were turnin
g up the hem of
 her skirt.  T
he cause of the 
delay was Natás
"ha’s skirt, wh"
ich was too long
. Two maids wer
e turning up the
 hem and hurried
ly biting off th
e ends of threa
d. A third with 
pins in her mout
h was running ab
out between the 
 countess and S�
"�nya, and a four"
th held the whol
e of the gossame
r garment up hi
gh on one uplift
ed hand.  “M
"ávra, quicker, "
darling!”  �
��Give me my thi
"mble, Miss, from"
 there...”  
“Whenever will
 you be ready?�
� asked the coun
t coming to the 
door. “Here i
s some scent. Pe
rónskaya must b
e tired of waiti
ng.”  “It�
"��s ready, Miss,"
” said the mai
"d, holding up th"
e shortened gauz
e dress with tw
"o fingers, and b"
lowing and shaki
ng something off
" it, as if
by t"
his to express a
 consciousness o
f the airiness a
nd purity of wha
t she held.  
Natásha began p
utting on the dr
ess.  “In a 
minute! In a min
ute! Don’t com
"e in, Papa!” s"
he cried to her 
 father as he op
ened the door—
speaking from un
der the filmy sk
irt which still
 covered her who
le face.  Són
ya slammed the d
oor to. A minute
 later they let 
the count in. He
 was wearing a 
blue swallow-tai
"l coat, shoes an"
"d stockings, and"
 was perfumed a
nd his hair poma
"ded.

“Oh, P"
apa! how nice yo
u look! Charming
!” cried Natá
"sha, as she
sto"
od in the middle
 of the room smo
othing out the f
olds of the gauz
e.  “If you 
"please, Miss! al"
"low me,” said "
"the maid, who on"
 her knees was 
pulling the skir
t straight and s
hifting the pins
 from one side o
f her mouth to 
the other with h
er tongue.  �
�Say what you li
"ke,” exclaimed"
" Sónya, in a de"
spairing voice a
s she looked at
" Natásha, “sa"
"y what you like,"
 it’s still to

tásha stepped b
ack to look at h
erself in the pi
er glass. The dr
ess was too lon
"g.

“Really,"
" madam, it is no"
t at all too lon
"g,” said Mávr"
"a, crawling on
"
her knees after 
her young lady. 
"

“Well, if i"
t’s too long w
e’ll tack it u
p... we’ll tac

the resolute Dun
yásha taking a 
needle that was 
 stuck on the fr
ont of her littl
"e shawl and, sti"
ll kneeling on t

set t"
o work once more
.  At that mom

"
“Oo-oo, my b"
eauty!” exclai
"med the count, �"
��she looks bett

 aside fearing t

"
“Mamma, your"

 Natásha. “I�

hed forward so t
hat the maids wh

up her skirt cou

 enough and a pi

 torn off.  �
��Oh goodness! W
hat has happened
? Really it was 
not my fault!”
  “Never min

" up, it won’t "

nyásha.  “W

 very queen!” 
said the nurse a

Sónya! They are
 lovely!”  A
t a quarter past
 ten they at las
t got into their
 carriages and s
tarted. But the
y had still to c
all at the Tauri
da Gardens.  P
erónskaya was q
uite ready. In s
pite of her age 
and plainness sh
e had gone thro
ugh the same pro
cess as the Rost
"óvs, but with l"
ess flurry—fo
r to her it was 
a matter of rout
ine. Her ugly ol
d body was wash
"ed, perfumed, an"
d powdered in ju
st the same way.
 She had washed 
 behind her ears
 just as careful
"ly, and when she"
 entered her dra
wing room in he
"r yellow dress, "
wearing her badg
e as maid of hon
"or, her old
lad"
y’s maid was a
s full of raptur
ous admiration a
s the Rostóvs�
� servants had 
been.  She pra
ised the Rostóv
s’ toilets. Th
ey praised her t
"aste and toilet,"
 and at eleven 
"o’clock, caref"
ul of their coif
fures and dresse
"s, they
settled"
 themselves in t
heir carriages a
nd drove off.  
     CHAPTER
 XV  Natásha 
had not had a mo
ment free since 
early morning an
d had not once 
had time to thin
k of what lay be
fore her.  In 
the damp chill a
ir and crowded c
loseness of the 
swaying carriage
", she
for the f"
irst time vividl
y imagined what 
was in store for
 her there at t
"he ball, in thos"
e brightly light
ed rooms—with 
"music, flowers, "
"dances,
the Emp"
"eror, and all th"
e brilliant youn
g people of Pete
rsburg. The pro
spect was so spl
endid that she h
ardly believed i
t would come tru
"e,
so out of ke"
eping was it wit
h the chill dark
ness and closene
ss of the carri
age. She underst
ood all that awa
ited her only wh
"en, after steppi"
ng over the red
 baize at the en
"trance, she ente"
"red the hall, to"
ok off her fur 
"cloak, and, besi"
de Sónya and in
 front of her mo
"ther, mounted th"
e brightly illu
minated stairs b
etween the flowe
rs. Only then di
d she remember 
how she must beh
"ave at a ball, a"
nd tried to assu
me the majestic 
 air she conside
red indispensabl
e for a girl on 
such an occasion
". But,
fortunat"
"ely for her, she"
 felt her eyes g
"rowing misty, sh"
e saw nothing c
"learly, her puls"
e beat a hundred
" to the minute, "
and the blood th
robbed at her h
eart. She could 
not assume that 
"pose, which woul"
d have made her 
"
ridiculous, and"
 she moved on al
most fainting fr
om excitement an
d trying with a
ll her might to 
conceal it. And 
this was the ver
y attitude that 
 became her best
. Before and beh
ind them other v
isitors were ent
"ering,
also tal"
king in low tone
s and wearing ba
ll dresses. The 
mirrors on the 
landing reflecte
d ladies in whit
"e, pale-blue, an"
"d pink dresses, "
with diamonds a
nd pearls on the
ir bare necks an
d arms.  Natá
sha looked in th
e mirrors and co
uld not distingu
ish her reflecti
on from the oth
ers. All was ble
nded into one br
illiant processi
on. On entering
 the ballroom th
e regular hum of
" voices, footste"
"ps, and
greetin"
gs deafened Nat�
"�sha, and the li"
ght and glitter 
dazzled her stil
l more. The hos
"t and hostess, w"
ho had already b
een standing at 
the door for ha
lf an hour repea
ting the same wo
rds to the vario
"us arrivals,
�"
�Charmé de vous
" voir,” * gree"
ted the Rostóvs
 and Perónskaya
 in the same ma
nner.      * �
��Delighted to s
ee you.”   
The two girls in
 their white dre
"sses, each with "
a rose in her b
"lack hair, both "
curtsied in the 
"same way, but th"
e hostess’ eye
 involuntarily 
rested longer on
 the slim Natás
ha. She looked a
t her and gave 
her alone a spec
ial smile in add
ition to her usu
al smile as hos
tess. Looking at
 her she may hav
e recalled the g
"olden, irrecover"
able days of he
r own girlhood a
nd her own first
 ball. The host 
also followed N
atásha with his
 eyes and asked 
the count which 
was his daughter
.  “Charming
"!” said he, ki"
ssing the tips o
f his fingers. 
 In the ballroo
m guests stood c
rowding at the e
ntrance doors aw
aiting the Empe
ror. The countes
s took up a posi
tion in one of t
he front rows o
f that crowd. Na
tásha heard and
 felt that sever
al people were a
sking about her
 and looking at 
her. She realize
d that those not
icing her liked 
"
her, and this o"
bservation helpe
d to calm her. 
 “There are s
ome like ourselv
es and some wors
"e,” she though"
t.  Perónskay
a was pointing o
ut to the counte
ss the most impo
rtant people at
 the ball.  �
�That is the Dut
"ch ambassador, d"
o you see? That 
"gray-haired man,"
"”
she said, i"
ndicating an old
 man with a prof
usion of silver-
gray curly hair
", who was surrou"
nded by ladies l
aughing at somet
hing he said.  
"
“Ah, here she"
" is, the Queen o"
"f Petersburg, Co"
untess Bezúkhov
"a,”
said Per�"
"�nskaya, indicat"
ing Hélène who
 had just entere
d. “How lovel
y! She is quite 
equal to Márya 
Antónovna. See 
"how the men, you"
"ng
and old, pay"
 court to her. B
eautiful and cle
ver... they say 
Prince —— i
s quite mad abou
"t her. But see, "
"those two, thoug"
h not good-look
"ing, are even mo"
re run after.”
  She pointed 
to a lady who wa
s crossing the r
oom followed by 
a very plain da
ughter.  “Sh
e is a splendid 
"match, a million"
"airess,” said "
Perónskaya. “
"And
look, here "
come her suitors
.”  “That 
is Bezúkhova’
"s brother, Anato"
"le Kurágin,” "
"she said,
indic"
ating a handsome
 officer of the 
Horse Guards who
 passed by them 
 with head erect
", looking at som"
ething over the 
heads of the lad
ies. “He’s 
"handsome, isn’"
t he? I hear the
y will marry him
 to that rich g
irl. But your co
"usin, Drubetskó"
"y, is also very "
attentive to her
. They say she 
has millions. Oh
" yes, that’s t"
he French ambass
ador himself!”
 she replied to
 the countess’
 inquiry about C
aulaincourt. “
Looks as if he 
were a king! All
" the same, the F"
rench are charmi
"ng, very charmin"
g. No one more 
charming in soci
"ety. Ah, here sh"
"e is! Yes, she i"
s still the mos
t beautiful of t
"hem all, our Má"
rya Antónovna! 
And how simply s
he is dressed! 
Lovely! And that
 stout one in sp
ectacles is the 
universal Freem
"ason,” she wen"
"t on, indicating"
 Pierre. “Put 
him beside his w
ife and he look
s a regular buff
oon!”  Pierr
"e, swaying his s"
"tout body, advan"
"ced, making way "
through the crow
d and nodding t
o right and left
 as casually and
 good-naturedly 
as if he were p
assing through a
 crowd at a fair
. He pushed thro
"ugh, evidently
"
looking for some
one.  Natásha
 looked joyfully
 at the familiar
" face of Pierre,"
 “the buffoon
",” as Perónsk"
aya had called h
"im, and knew he "
was looking for 
"
them, and for h"
er in particular
. He had promise
d to be at the b
all and introdu
ce partners to h
er.  But befor
e he reached the
m Pierre stopped
 beside a very h
"andsome, dark
m"
an of middle hei
"ght, and in a wh"
"ite uniform, who"
 stood by a wind
ow talking to a
 tall man wearin
g stars and a ri
bbon. Natásha a
t once recogniz
ed the shorter a
nd younger man i
n the white unif
orm: it was Bol
"kónski, who see"
med to her to ha
ve grown much yo
"unger, happier, "
and better-look
ing.  “There
’s someone els
e we know—Bolk
"ónski, do you s"
"ee, Mamma?”
s"
"aid Natásha, po"
inting out Princ
e Andrew. “You
" remember, he st"
ayed a night wi
th us at Otrádn

“Oh,"
 you know him?�
� said Perónska
ya. “I can’t
 bear him. Il fa

��s too proud fo

at him. “I’d

     * “He is

    CHAPTER X
VI  Suddenly e
verybody stirred
", began talking,"
 and pressed for
ward and then b
"ack, and between"
" the two rows, w"
"hich separated, "
the Emperor ente
red to the soun
ds of music that
 had immediately
 struck up. Behi
nd him walked h
is host and host
ess. He walked i
"n rapidly, bowin"
g to right and l
eft as if anxio
us to get the fi
rst moments of t
he reception ove
r. The band pla
yed the polonais
e in vogue at th
at time on accou
nt of the words 
that had been s
"et to it, beginn"
ing: “Alexande
"r, Elisaveta, al"
l our hearts yo
u ravish quite..
.” The Emperor
 passed on to th
"e drawing room, "
the crowd made 
a rush for the d
"oors, and severa"
l persons with e
xcited faces hu
rried there and 
back again. Then
 the crowd hasti
ly retired from 
 the drawing roo
"m door, at which"
 the Emperor rea
ppeared talking 
to the hostess.
" A young man, lo"
oking distraught
", pounced down o"
"n the ladies,
a"
sking them to mo
ve aside. Some l
"adies, with face"
s betraying comp
lete forgetfuln
ess of all the r
"ules of decorum,"
 pushed forward 
to the detrimen
t of their toile
ts. The men bega
n to choose part
ners and take t
heir places for 
the polonaise. 
 Everyone moved
" back, and the E"
mperor came smil
ing out of the d
rawing room lea
ding his hostess
 by the hand but
 not keeping tim
e to the music.
 The host follow
ed with Márya A
ntónovna Narýs
hkina; then cam
"e ambassadors, m"
"inisters, and va"
"rious generals, "
whom Perónskaya
 diligently nam
ed. More than ha
lf the ladies al
ready had partne
rs and were tak
"ing up, or prepa"
"ring to take up,"
 their positions
 for the polona
ise. Natásha fe
lt that she woul
d be left with h
er mother and S
ónya among a mi
nority of women 
who crowded near
" the wall, not h"
aving been invi
ted to dance. Sh
e stood with her
 slender arms ha
"nging down,
her"
 scarcely define
d bosom rising a
nd falling regul
"arly, and with
"
bated breath and
" glittering, fri"
ghtened eyes gaz
ed straight befo
"re
her, evident"
ly prepared for 
the height of jo
y or misery. She
 was not concer
ned about the Em
peror or any of 
those great peop
le whom Peróns
kaya was pointin
g out—she had 
but one thought:
 “Is it possi
ble no one will 
"ask me, that I s"
hall not be amon
g the first to 
dance? Is it pos
sible that not o
ne of all these 
men will notice 
me? They do not
 even seem to se
"e me, or if they"
 do they look as
 if they were s
"aying, ‘Ah, sh"
e’s not the on
"e I’m after, s"
o it’s not wor
th looking at h
"er!’ No, it’"
"s impossible,”"
 she thought. �
�They must know
 how I long to d
"ance, how splend"
"idly I dance, an"
d how they would
 enjoy dancing 
with me.”  T
he strains of th
"e polonaise, whi"
ch had continued
 for a considera
"ble
time, had b"
egun to sound li
ke a sad reminis
cence to Natásh
a’s ears. She
 wanted to cry. 
Perónskaya had 
left them. The c
ount was at the 
 other end of th
e room. She and 
the countess and
 Sónya were sta
nding by themse
lves as in the d
epths of a fores
t amid that crow
"d of strangers,"
 with no one int
erested in them 
and not wanted b
y anyone. Prince
 Andrew with a 
"lady passed by, "
evidently not re
cognizing them. 
The handsome An
atole was smilin
gly talking to a
 partner on his 
arm and looked a
t Natásha as o
ne looks at a wa
ll. Borís passe
d them twice and
 each time turn
ed away. Berg an
"d his wife, who "
were not dancing
", came up to the"
m.  This famil
y gathering seem
ed humiliating t
o Natásha—as 
if there were n
owhere else for 
the family to ta
lk but here at t
he ball. She did
 not listen to 
or look at Véra
", who was tellin"
g her something 
about her own g
reen dress.  A
t last the Emper
or stopped besid
e his last partn
er (he had dance
d with three) a
nd the music cea
sed. A worried a
ide-de-camp ran 
up to the Rost�
�vs requesting t
hem to stand far
"ther back, thoug"
h as it was they
 were already c
lose to the wall
", and from the g"
allery resounded
" the
distinct, "
"precise, enticin"
gly rhythmical s
trains of a walt
z. The Emperor 
looked smilingly
 down the room. 
A minute passed 
but no one had y
et begun dancin
g. An aide-de-ca
"mp, the Master o"
"f Ceremonies, we"
nt up to Countes
s Bezúkhova an
d asked her to d
ance. She smilin
gly raised her h
and and laid it
 on his shoulder
 without looking
 at him. The aid
"e-de-camp, an
a"
"dept in his art,"
 grasping his pa
rtner firmly rou
"nd her waist, wi"
th confident de
liberation start
"ed smoothly, gli"
ding first round
 the edge of th
"e circle, then a"
t the corner of 
the room he caug
ht Hélène’s 
 left hand and t
"urned her, the o"
nly sound audibl
"e, apart from th"
e ever-quickeni
"ng music, being "
the rhythmic cli
ck of the spurs 
"on his
rapid, a"
"gile feet, while"
 at every third 
beat his partner
’s velvet dre
ss spread out an
d seemed to flas
h as she whirled
 round. Natásha
 gazed at them 
and was ready to
 cry because it 
was not she who 
was dancing tha
t first turn of 
the waltz.  Pr
"ince Andrew, in "
the white unifor
m of a cavalry c
"olonel, wearing"
 stockings and d
"ancing shoes, st"
ood looking anim
ated and bright 
in the front ro
w of the circle 
not far from the
 Rostóvs. Baron
 Firhoff was ta
lking to him abo
ut the first sit
ting of the Coun
cil of State to 
be held next da
y. Prince Andrew
", as one closely"
 connected with 
Speránski and 
participating in
 the work of the
 legislative com
"mission, could g"
ive reliable in
formation about 
"that sitting, co"
ncerning which v
arious rumors w
ere current. But
 not listening t
o what Firhoff w
"as saying, he wa"
s gazing now at
 the sovereign a
nd now at the me
n intending to d
ance who had no
t yet gathered c
ourage to enter 
the circle.  P
rince Andrew was
 watching these 
men abashed by t
he Emperor’s 
"presence, and th"
e women who were
 breathlessly lo
nging to be aske
d to dance.  
Pierre came up t
o him and caught
 him by the arm.
  “You alway
s dance. I have 
"a protégée, th"
e young Rostóva
", here. Ask
her"
",” he said.
"
 “Where is she
?” asked Bolk�
�nski. “Excuse
 me!” he added
", turning
to th"
"e baron, “we w"
ill finish this 
conversation els
ewhere—at a ba
ll one must dan
ce.” He steppe
d forward in the
 direction Pierr
e indicated. Th
"e despairing, de"
jected expressio
n of Natásha’
s face caught hi
s eye. He recog
"nized her, guess"
"ed her feelings,"
 saw that it was
" her début,
re"
membered her con
versation at the
" window, and wit"
h an expression 
of pleasure on 
his face approac
hed Countess Ros
tóva.  “All
ow me to introdu
ce you to my dau
"ghter,” said t"
"he countess, wit"
h heightened co
lor.  “I hav
e the pleasure o
f being already 
"acquainted, if t"
he countess rem
"embers me,” sa"
id Prince Andrew
 with a low and 
courteous bow qu
ite belying Per
ónskaya’s rem
arks about his r
"udeness, and app"
roaching Natás
ha he held out h
is arm to grasp 
her waist before
 he had complete
d his invitatio
n. He asked her 
to waltz. That t
remulous express
ion on Natásha
"’s face, prepa"
red either for d
espair or raptur
"e, suddenly
bri"
ghtened into a h
"appy, grateful, "
childlike smile.
  “I have lo
ng been waiting 
"for you,” that"
 frightened happ
y little girl s
eemed to say by 
the smile that r
eplaced the thre
"atened tears, as"
 she raised her
 hand to Prince 
Andrew’s shoul
der. They were t
he second coupl
e to enter the c
ircle. Prince An
drew was one of 
the best dancers
 of his day and
 Natásha danced
 exquisitely. He
r little feet in
 their white sa
tin dancing shoe
s did their work
" swiftly, lightl"
"y, and independe"
ntly of herself
", while her face"
 beamed with ecs
tatic happiness.
 Her slender ba
re arms and neck
 were not beauti
ful—compared t
o Hélène’s h
er shoulders lo
oked thin and he
r bosom undevelo
ped. But Hélèn
"e seemed, as
it"
" were, hardened "
by a varnish lef
t by the thousan
ds of looks that
 had scanned he
"r person, while "
Natásha was lik
e a girl exposed
 for the first 
"time, who would "
have felt very m
uch ashamed had 
she not been ass
ured that this 
was absolutely n
ecessary.  Pri
nce Andrew liked
" dancing, and wi"
shing to escape 
as quickly as p
ossible from the
 political and c
lever talk which
 everyone addres
"sed
to him, wis"
hing also to bre
ak up the circle
 of restraint he
" disliked,
caus"
ed by the Empero
"r’s presence, "
"he danced, and h"
ad chosen Natás
ha because Pier
re pointed her o
ut to him and be
cause she was th
e first pretty 
girl who caught 
his eye; but sca
rcely had he emb
raced that slen
der supple figur
e and felt her s
tirring so close
 to him and smil
ing so near him
 than the wine o
f her charm rose
" to his head, an"
d he felt himse
lf revived and r
ejuvenated when 
after leaving he
r he stood brea
thing deeply and
 watching the ot
her dancers.  
    CHAPTER 
XVII  After Pr
"ince Andrew, Bor"
ís came up to a
sk Natásha for 
"a dance, and
th"
en the aide-de-c
amp who had open
"ed the ball, and"
 several other y
"oung
men, so th"
"at, flushed and "
"happy, and passi"
ng on her superf
luous partners 
"to Sónya, she d"
id not cease dan
cing all the eve
ning. She notice
d and saw nothi
ng of what occup
ied everyone els
e. Not only did 
she fail to not
ice that the Emp
eror talked a lo
ng time with the
 French ambassad
"or,
and how par"
ticularly gracio
us he was to a c
"ertain lady, or "
that Prince So-
and-so and So-an
d-so did and sai
"d this and that,"
 and that Hélè
ne had great su
ccess and was ho
nored by the spe
cial attention o
"f So-and-so,
bu"
t she did not ev
en see the Emper
"or, and only not"
iced that he had
 gone because t
he ball became l
ivelier after hi
s departure. For
 one of the mer
ry cotillions be
fore supper Prin
ce Andrew was ag
ain her partner.
 He reminded he
r of their first
 encounter in th
e Otrádnoe aven
"ue, and how
she"
 had been unable
 to sleep that m
"oonlight night, "
and told her how
 he had involun
tarily overheard
 her. Natásha b
lushed at that r
ecollection and
 tried to excuse
" herself, as if "
there had been s
omething to be 
ashamed of in wh
at Prince Andrew
 had overheard. 
  Like all men 
who have grown u
"p in society, Pr"
ince Andrew like
d meeting someo
ne there not of 
the conventional
 society stamp. 
And such was Na
"tásha, with her"
" surprise, her d"
"elight, her shyn"
"ess, and even he"
r mistakes in s
peaking French. 
With her he beha
ved with special
 care and tende
"rness, sitting b"
eside her and ta
lking of the sim
plest and most 
unimportant matt
ers; he admired 
her shy grace. I
n the middle of 
"the
cotillion, "
having completed
 one of the figu
"res, Natásha, s"
till out of bre
"ath, was returni"
ng to her seat w
hen another danc
er chose her. Sh
e was tired and
 panting and evi
dently thought o
"f declining, but"
 immediately pu
t her hand gaily
 on the man’s 
"shoulder, smilin"
g at Prince Andr
ew.  “I’d 
be glad to sit b
eside you and re
st: I’m tired;
 but you see ho
w they keep aski
"ng me, and I’m"
" glad of it, I�"
�m happy and I l
"ove
everybody, "
and you and I un
"derstand it all,"
"” and much, mu"
ch more was sai
d in her smile. 
When her partner
 left her Natás
ha ran across th
e room to choos
e two ladies for
 the figure.  
“If she goes t
o her cousin fir
st and then to a
"nother lady, she"
 will be my wif
"e,” said Princ"
e Andrew to hims
elf quite to his
" own surprise, a"
s he watched he
r. She did go fi
rst to her cousi
n.  “What ru
bbish sometimes 
enters one’s h
ead!” thought 
"Prince Andrew,
"
“but what is c
ertain is that t
hat girl is so c
"harming, so orig"
"inal,
that she "
won’t be danci
ng here a month 
before she will 
be married.... 
Such as she are 
"rare here,” he"
" thought, as Nat"
"ásha, readjusti"
ng a rose that 
was slipping on 
"her bodice, sett"
led herself besi
de him.  When 
the cotillion wa
s over the old c
ount in his blue
 coat came up to
 the dancers. H
e invited Prince
 Andrew to come 
"and see them, an"
d asked his dau
ghter whether sh
e was enjoying h
erself. Natásha
 did not answer 
 at once but onl
y looked up with
 a smile that sa
id reproachfully
: “How can yo
u ask such a que
stion?”  “
I have never enj
oyed myself so m
uch before!” s
"he said, and Pri"
nce Andrew noti
ced how her thin
 arms rose quick
ly as if to embr
ace her father 
and instantly dr
opped again. Nat
ásha was happie
r than she had 
ever been in her
 life. She was a
t that height of
 bliss when one 
becomes complet
ely kind and goo
d and does not b
elieve in the po
ssibility of ev
"il, unhappiness,"
 or sorrow.  A
t that ball Pier
re for the first
 time felt humil
iated by the pos
ition his wife 
occupied in cour
t circles. He wa
s gloomy and abs
ent-minded. A d
eep furrow ran a
cross his forehe
"ad, and standing"
 by a window he 
stared over his
 spectacles seei
ng no one.  On
 her way to supp
er Natásha pass
ed him.  Pierr
"e’s gloomy, un"
happy look struc
k her. She stopp
ed in front of h
im. She wished 
"to help him, to "
bestow on him th
e superabundance
 of her own hap
piness.  “Ho
w delightful it 
"is, Count!” sa"
id she. “Isn�
�t it?”  Pie
rre smiled absen
"t-mindedly, evid"
ently not graspi
ng what she said
".

“Yes, I a"
"m very glad,” "
he said.  “H
ow can people be
 dissatisfied wi
th anything?” 
thought Natásha
. “Especially
 such a capital 
fellow as Bezúk
hov!” In Natá
sha’s eyes al
l the people at 
the ball alike w
"ere good, kind, "
and splendid pe
"ople, loving one"
 another; none o
f them capable o
f injuring anot
her—and so the
y ought all to b
e happy.    
  CHAPTER XVII
I  Next day Pr
ince Andrew thou
"ght of the ball,"
 but his mind di
d not dwell on 
"it long. “Yes,"
 it was a very b
"rilliant ball,�"
� and then... �
"�Yes,
that litt"
le Rostóva is v
ery charming. Th
ere’s somethin
"g fresh,
origin"
"al, un-Petersbur"
g-like about her
 that distinguis
hes her.” That
 was all he tho
ught about yeste
"rday’s ball, a"
nd after his mor
ning tea he set
 to work.  But
 either from fat
igue or want of 
sleep he was ill
-disposed for wo
rk and could ge
t nothing done. 
He kept criticiz
ing his own work
", as he
often d"
"id, and was glad"
 when he heard s
omeone coming. 
 The visitor wa
"s Bítski, who s"
erved on various
" committees, fre"
quented all the
 societies in Pe
"tersburg, and wa"
s a passionate d
evotee of the ne
w ideas and of 
"Speránski, and "
a diligent Peter
sburg newsmonger
—one of those
 men who choose 
their opinions l
ike their clothe
s according to 
"the fashion, but"
 who for that ve
ry reason appear
 to be the warme
st partisans. H
ardly had he got
 rid of his hat 
before he ran in
to Prince Andre
w’s room with 
a preoccupied ai
r and at once be
gan talking. He 
 had just heard 
particulars of t
hat morning’s 
sitting of the C
ouncil of State
 opened by the E
"mperor, and he s"
poke of it enthu
siastically. The
 Emperor’s sp
eech had been ex
traordinary. It 
had been a speec
h such as only 
constitutional m
onarchs deliver.
 “The Sovereig
n plainly said 
that the Council
 and Senate are 
estates of the r
"ealm, he said th"
at the governme
nt must rest not
 on authority bu
t on secure base
s. The Emperor 
said that the fi
scal system must
 be reorganized 
and the accounts
"
published,” "
recounted Bítsk
"i, emphasizing c"
ertain words and
 opening his ey
es significantly
".

“Ah, yes!"
 Today’s event
"s mark an epoch,"
 the greatest ep
och in our hist
"ory,” he concl"
uded.  Prince 
Andrew listened 
to the account o
f the opening of
 the Council of 
"
State, which he"
 had so impatien
tly awaited and 
to which he had 
attached such i
"mportance, and w"
as surprised tha
"t this event, no"
w that it had t
"aken place, did "
"not affect him, "
and even seemed 
quite insignific
ant. He listene
d with quiet iro
ny to Bítski’
s enthusiastic a
ccount of it. A 
 very simple tho
ught occurred to
 him: “What do
es it matter to 
me or to Bítsk
i what the Emper
or was pleased t
o say at the Cou
ncil? Can all th
at make me any 
happier or bette
r?”  And thi
s simple reflect
ion suddenly des
troyed all the i
nterest Prince 
Andrew had felt 
in the impending
 reforms. He was
 going to dine t
hat evening at 
"Speránski’s, "
“with only a f
"ew friends,” a"
s the host had 
said when inviti
ng him. The pros
pect of that din
ner in the intim
ate home circle
 of the man he s
o admired had gr
eatly interested
" Prince
Andrew,"
 especially as h
e had not yet se
en Speránski in
 his domestic s
"urroundings, but"
 now he felt dis
inclined to go t
o it.  At the 
"appointed hour, "
"however, he ente"
red the modest h
ouse Speránski 
 owned in the Ta
urida Gardens. I
n the parqueted 
dining room of t
his small house
", remarkable for"
 its extreme cle
anliness (sugges
ting that of a 
"monastery), Prin"
"ce Andrew, who w"
"as rather late, "
found the friend
ly gathering of
 Speránski’s 
intimate acquain
tances already a
ssembled at fiv
e o’clock. The
re were no ladie
s present except
 Speránski’s 
 little daughter
 (long-faced lik
e her father) an
d her governess.
 The other gues
"ts were Gervais,"
" Magnítski, and"
 Stolýpin. Whil
e still in the 
anteroom Prince 
Andrew heard lou
d voices and a r
inging staccato 
 laugh—a laugh
 such as one hea
rs on the stage.
 Someone—it so
unded like Sper
ánski—was dis
tinctly ejaculat
ing ha-ha-ha. Pr
ince Andrew had
 never before he
ard Speránski�
"�s famous laugh,"
 and this ringin
"g,
high-pitched"
 laughter from a
 statesman made 
a strange impres
sion on him.  
He entered the d
ining room. The 
whole company we
re standing betw
een two windows
 at a small tabl
e laid with hors
-d’oeuvres. Sp
"eránski, wearin"
g a gray swallo
w-tail coat with
 a star on the b
"reast, and evide"
ntly still the 
same waistcoat a
nd high white st
ock he had worn 
at the meeting o
f the Council o
"f State, stood a"
t the table with
 a beaming count
enance. His gue
sts surrounded h
"im. Magnítski, "
addressing himse
lf to Speránski
",
was relating "
"an anecdote, and"
 Speránski was 
laughing in adva
nce at what Mag
nítski was goin
g to say. When P
rince Andrew ent
ered the room M
agnítski’s wo
rds were again c
rowned by laught
er. Stolýpin ga
ve a deep bass 
guffaw as he mun
ched a piece of 
bread and cheese
. Gervais laugh
ed softly with a
 hissing chuckle
", and Speránski"
 in a high-pitch
ed staccato man
ner.  Still la
"ughing, Speráns"
ki held out his 
soft white hand 
to Prince Andre
w.  “Very pl
eased to see you
", Prince,” he "
said. “One mom
ent...” he we
"nt on, turning t"
o Magnítski and
 interrupting hi
s story. “We h
ave agreed that
 this is a dinne
r for recreation
", with not a wor"
d about busines
s!” and turnin
g again to the n
arrator he began
 to laugh afresh
.  Prince Andr
ew looked at the
 laughing Sperá
nski with astoni
"shment,
regret,"
 and disillusion
ment. It seemed 
to him that this
 was not Sperá
nski but someone
 else. Everythin
g that had forme
rly appeared my
sterious and fas
cinating in Sper
ánski suddenly 
became plain and
 unattractive. 
  At dinner the
 conversation di
d not cease for 
a moment and see
med to consist 
of the contents 
of a book of fun
ny anecdotes. Be
fore Magnítski 
 had finished hi
s story someone 
else was anxious
 to relate somet
hing still funn
ier. Most of the
" anecdotes, if n"
ot relating to t
he state servic
"e, related to pe"
ople in the serv
ice. It seemed t
hat in this com
pany the insigni
ficance of those
 people was so d
efinitely accept
ed that the onl
y possible attit
ude toward them 
was one of good 
humored ridicul
e. Speránski re
lated how at the
 Council that mo
rning a deaf di
"gnitary, when as"
"ked his opinion,"
 replied that he
 thought so too.
 Gervais gave a
 long account of
 an official rev
"ision, remarkabl"
e for the stupi
dity of everybod
y concerned. Sto
"lýpin, stutteri"
"ng, broke into
"
the conversation
 and began excit
edly talking of 
the abuses that 
existed under t
he former order 
of things—thre
atening to give 
a serious turn 
to the conversat
ion. Magnítski 
starting quizzin
g Stolýpin abou
t his vehemence
. Gervais interv
ened with a joke
", and the talk r"
everted to its 
former lively to
ne.  Evidently
 Speránski like
d to rest after 
his labors and f
ind amusement i
n a circle of fr
"iends, and his g"
"uests, understan"
"ding his wish, t"
ried to enliven
 him and amuse t
hemselves. But t
heir gaiety seem
ed to Prince An
drew mirthless a
nd tiresome. Spe
ránski’s high
-pitched voice s
truck him unple
"asantly, and the"
 incessant laugh
ter grated on hi
m like a false 
note. Prince And
rew did not laug
h and feared tha
t he would be a 
damper on the s
pirits of the co
"mpany, but no on"
e took any notic
e of his being 
out of harmony w
ith the general 
mood. They all s
eemed very gay. 
  He tried seve
ral times to joi
n in the convers
"ation, but his r"
emarks were tos
sed aside each t
ime like a cork 
thrown out of th
"e water, and he "
could not jest 
with them.  Th
ere was nothing 
wrong or unseeml
y in what they s
"aid, it was witt"
y and might hav
"e been funny, bu"
t it lacked just
 that something 
which is the sa
"lt of mirth, and"
 they were not e
ven aware that s
uch a thing exis
ted.  After di
nner Speránski�
��s daughter and
 her governess r
ose. He patted 
the little girl 
with his white h
and and kissed h
er. And that ges
"ture,
too, seem"
ed unnatural to 
Prince Andrew. 
 The men remain
ed at table over
 their port—En
glish fashion. I
n the midst of 
a conversation t
hat was started 
about Napoleon�
�s Spanish affa
"irs, which they "
all agreed in ap
"proving, Prince "
Andrew began to 
 express a contr
ary opinion. Spe
ránski smiled a
"nd, with an evid"
ent wish to pre
vent the convers
ation from takin
g an unpleasant 
"course, told a
"
story that had n
o connection wit
h the previous c
onversation. For
 a few moments 
all were silent.
  Having sat s
ome time at tabl
"e, Speránski co"
rked a bottle of
" wine and,
rema"
"rking, “Nowada"
ys good wine rid
es in a carriage
" and pair,” pa"
ssed it to the 
servant and got 
up. All rose and
 continuing to t
alk loudly went
 into the drawin
g room. Two lett
ers brought by a
 courier were ha
nded to Sperán
ski and he took 
them to his stud
y. As soon as he
 had left the r
oom the general 
merriment stoppe
d and the guests
 began to conver
se sensibly and
 quietly with on
e another.  �
�Now for the rec
itation!” said
 Speránski on r
eturning from h
is study. “A w
onderful talent!
” he said to P
"rince Andrew, an"
d Magnítski im
mediately assume
d a pose and beg
an reciting some
 humorous verse
s in French whic
h he had compose
d about various 
well-known Pete
rsburg people. H
e was interrupte
d several times 
by applause. Whe
n the verses we
re finished Prin
ce Andrew went u
p to Speránski 
and took his le
ave.  “Where
 are you off to 
so early?” ask
ed Speránski. 
 “I promised 
to go to a recep
tion.”  They
 said no more. P
rince Andrew loo
ked closely into
 those mirrorlik
"e,
impenetrable"
" eyes, and felt "
that it had been
 ridiculous of h
im to have expe
cted anything fr
om Speránski an
d from any of hi
s own activities
 connected with
" him, or ever to"
 have attributed
 importance to w
hat Speránski 
was doing. That 
"precise, mirthle"
ss laughter rang
 in Prince Andr
ew’s ears long
 after he had le
ft the house.  
 When he reached
 home Prince And
rew began thinki
ng of his life i
n Petersburg du
ring those last 
four months as i
f it were someth
ing new. He rec
alled his exerti
ons and solicita
"tions, and the h"
istory of his pr
oject of army r
"eform, which had"
 been accepted f
or consideration
 and which they 
 were trying to 
pass over in sil
ence simply beca
"use another, a v"
"ery poor
one, h"
ad already been 
prepared and sub
mitted to the Em
peror. He though
t of the meetin
gs of a committe
e of which Berg 
was a member. He
 remembered how
 carefully and a
t what length ev
erything relatin
g to form and p
rocedure was dis
cussed at those 
"meetings, and ho"
w sedulously and
 promptly all t
hat related to t
he gist of the b
usiness was evad
ed. He recalled
 his labors on t
"he Legal Code, a"
nd how painstaki
ngly he had tra
nslated the arti
cles of the Roma
n and French cod
"es into Russian,"
 and he felt as
hamed of himself
. Then he vividl
y pictured to hi
mself Boguchár
"ovo, his occupat"
ions in the coun
"try, his journey"
 to Ryazán; he
 remembered the 
peasants and Dro
n the village el
"der, and mentall"
y applying to t
hem the Personal
 Rights he had d
ivided into para
"graphs, he
felt"
 astonished that
 he could have s
pent so much tim
e on such useles
s work.    
  CHAPTER XIX 
  Next day Prin
ce Andrew called
 at a few houses
 he had not visi
"ted before,
and"
 among them at t
he Rostóvs’ w
ith whom he had 
renewed acquaint
ance at the bal
l. Apart from co
nsiderations of 
politeness which
 demanded the c
"all, he wanted t"
o see that origi
"nal, eager girl "
who had left suc
h a pleasant im
pression on his 
"mind, in her own"
 home.  Natás
ha was one of th
e first to meet 
him. She was wea
ring a dark-blue
 house dress in
 which Prince An
drew thought her
 even prettier t
han in her ball
 dress. She and 
all the Rostóv 
family welcomed 
him as an old f
"riend, simply an"
d cordially. The
" whole family, w"
hom he had forme
rly judged seve
"rely, now seemed"
 to him to consi
"st of excellent,"
" simple,
and ki"
ndly people. The
 old count’s h
ospitality and g
"ood nature, whic"
h struck one es
pecially in Pete
rsburg as a plea
"sant surprise, w"
ere such that P
rince Andrew cou
ld not refuse to
 stay to dinner.
" “Yes,”
he "
"thought, “they"
 are capital peo
"ple, who of cour"
se have not the 
 slightest idea 
what a treasure 
they possess in 
Natásha; but th
ey are kindly f
olk and form the
 best possible s
etting for this 
strikingly poet
"ic, charming gir"
"l, overflowing w"
ith life!”  
In Natásha Prin
ce Andrew was co
nscious of a str
ange world compl
etely alien to 
him and brimful 
of joys unknown 
"to him, a differ"
"ent world,
that"
 in the Otrádno
e avenue and at 
the window that 
moonlight night 
 had already beg
un to disconcert
 him. Now this w
orld disconcerte
d him no longer
 and was no long
"er alien to him,"
 but he himself 
having entered i
t found in it a
 new enjoyment. 
  After dinner 
"Natásha, at Pri"
nce Andrew’s r
"equest, went to "
the clavichord 
and began singin
g. Prince Andrew
 stood by a wind
ow talking to t
he ladies and li
stened to her. I
n the midst of a
 phrase he cease
d speaking and 
suddenly felt te
"ars choking him,"
 a thing he had 
thought impossi
ble for him. He 
looked at Natás
"ha as she sang, "
and something ne
w and joyful st
irred in his sou
l. He felt happy
 and at the same
 time sad. He h
ad absolutely no
thing to weep ab
out yet he was r
eady to weep. Wh
at about? His f
ormer love? The 
little princess?
 His disillusion
ments?... His h
opes for the fut
ure?... Yes and 
no. The chief re
ason was a sudde
"n,
vivid sense "
of the terrible 
contrast between
 something infin
itely great and
 illimitable wit
hin him and that
 limited and mat
erial something 
"that
he, and ev"
"en she, was. Thi"
s contrast weigh
ed on and yet ch
eered him while
 she sang.  As
 soon as Natásh
a had finished s
he went up to hi
m and asked how 
he liked her vo
ice. She asked t
his and then bec
"ame confused, fe"
eling that she 
ought not to hav
e asked it. He s
"miled, looking a"
"t her, and said "
he liked her si
nging as he like
d everything she
 did.  Prince 
Andrew left the 
Rostóvs’ late
 in the evening.
 He went to bed 
"
from habit, but"
 soon realized t
hat he could not
 sleep. Having l
it his candle h
"e sat up in bed,"
" then got up, th"
en lay down agai
n not at all tr
oubled by his sl
eeplessness: his
 soul was as fre
sh and joyful as
 if he had step
ped out of a stu
ffy room into Go
d’s own fresh 
air. It did not 
 enter his head 
that he was in l
ove with Natásh
a; he was not th
inking about he
"r, but only pict"
uring her to him
"self, and in con"
sequence all li
fe appeared in a
 new light. “W
"hy do I strive, "
why do I toil in
" this
narrow, c"
"onfined frame, w"
"hen life, all li"
fe with all its 
"joys, is open
t"
o me?” said he
 to himself. And
 for the first t
ime for a very l
ong while he be
gan making happy
 plans for the f
uture. He decide
d that he must 
attend to his so
n’s education 
by finding a tut
or and putting 
the boy in his c
"harge, then he o"
ught to retire f
rom the service 
"and go
abroad, "
"and see England,"
 Switzerland and
 Italy. “I mus
t use my freedom
 while I feel s
o much strength 
"and youth in me,"
” he said to h
imself. “Pier
re was right whe
n he said one mu
st believe in th
e possibility of
 happiness in o
rder to be happy
", and now I do b"
elieve in it. Le
t the dead bury
" their dead, but"
 while one has l
ife one must liv
e and be happy!�
�� thought he. 
      CHAPT
ER XX  One mor
ning Colonel Ber
"g, whom Pierre k"
new as he knew e
verybody in Mos
cow and Petersbu
"rg, came to see "
him. Berg arrive
d in an immacula
te brand-new un
"iform, with his "
hair pomaded and
 brushed forward
 over his templ
es as the Empero
r Alexander wore
 his hair.  �
�I have just bee
n to see the cou
"ntess, your wife"
. Unfortunately 
she could not g
"rant my request,"
" but I hope, Cou"
"nt, I shall be m"
ore fortunate w
"ith you,” he s"
aid with a smile
.  “What is 
"it you wish, Col"
onel? I am at yo
ur service.” 
 “I have now 
quite settled in
" my new rooms, C"
ount” (Berg sa
id this with pe
rfect conviction
 that this infor
mation could not
 but be agreeab
"le), “and so I"
 wish to arrange
 just a small pa
rty for my own 
and my wife’s 
friends.” (He 
smiled still mor
e pleasantly.) �
��I wished to a
sk the countess 
and you to do me
 the honor of co
ming to tea and
 to supper.” 
 Only Countess 
"Hélène, consid"
ering the societ
y of such people
 as the Bergs b
"eneath her, coul"
d be cruel enoug
h to refuse such
 an invitation. 
 Berg explained 
so clearly why h
e wanted to coll
ect at his house
 a small but se
"lect company, an"
d why this would
 give him pleasu
"re, and why thou"
gh he grudged s
pending money on
 cards or anythi
"ng harmful, he w"
as prepared to 
run into some ex
pense for the sa
ke of good socie
ty—that Pierre
 could not refu
"se, and promised"
 to come.  “
But don’t be l
"ate, Count, if I"
 may venture to 
ask; about ten 
minutes to eight
", please. We sha"
ll make up a rub
ber. Our general
 is coming. He 
is very good to 
me. We shall hav
"e supper, Count."
 So you will do
 me the favor.�
�  Contrary to
 his habit of be
"ing late, Pierre"
 on that day arr
ived at the Ber
"gs’ house, not"
 at ten but at f
ifteen minutes t
o eight.  Havi
ng prepared ever
ything necessary
" for the party, "
the Bergs were r
eady for their 
guests’ arriva
l.  In their n
"ew, clean, and l"
ight study with 
its small busts 
and pictures an
d new furniture 
sat Berg and his
" wife. Berg, clo"
sely buttoned up
 in his new uni
"form, sat beside"
 his wife explai
ning to her that
 one always cou
ld and should be
 acquainted with
 people above on
"e, because only "
then does one g
et satisfaction 
from acquaintanc
es.  “You ca
n get to know so
"mething, you can"
 ask for somethi
ng. See how I m
anaged from my f
irst promotion.�
�� (Berg measure
d his life not b
y years but by 
promotions.) “
My comrades are 
"still nobodies, "
while I am only 
 waiting for a v
acancy to comman
"d a regiment, an"
d have the happi
ness to be your
 husband.” (He
 rose and kissed
" Véra’s hand,"
 and on the way 
 to her straight
ened out a turne
d-up corner of t
he carpet.) “A
nd how have I o
btained all this
? Chiefly by kno
wing how to choo
se my aquaintan
ces. It goes wit
hout saying that
 one must be con
scientious and 
methodical.” 
 Berg smiled wi
th a sense of hi
s superiority ov
"er a weak woman,"
" and
paused, re"
flecting that th
is dear wife of 
his was after al
l but a weak wo
man who could no

the same unders

to Véra all men

" all men, though"
 they understand

 conceited and

 rose and embrac
ed his wife care
"fully, so as not"
 to crush her la
ce fichu for wh

"a good price, ki"
ssing her straig
ht on the lips.
  “The only 
"thing is, we mus"

"� he
continued,"
 following an un
conscious sequen
ce of ideas.  
"“Yes,” answe"

don’t at all w
ant that. We mus
t live for soci
ety.”  “Pr
incess Yusúpova
 wore one exactl
"y like this,” "
"said Berg, point"
ing to the fich
u with a happy a
nd kindly smile.
  Just then Co
unt Bezúkhov wa
s announced. Hus
band and wife gl
anced at one an
"other, both smil"
ing with self-sa
"tisfaction, and "
each mentally cl
aiming the hono
r of this visit.
  “This is w
hat comes of kno
wing how to make
" acquaintances,�"
�� thought Berg
. “This is wha
t comes of knowi
ng how to conduc
t oneself.”  
 “But please d
on’t interrupt
 me when I am en
tertaining the g
"uests,”
said "
"Véra, “becaus"
e I know what in
terests each of 
them and what to
 say to differe
nt people.”  
 Berg smiled aga
in.  “It can
’t be helped: 
men must sometim
es have masculin
"e
conversation,"
” said he.  
They received Pi
erre in their sm
"all, new drawing"
" room, where it "
was impossible 
to sit down anyw
here without dis
turbing its symm
"etry,
neatness,"
 and order; so i
t was quite comp
rehensible and n
ot strange that 
"
Berg, having ge"
nerously offered
 to disturb the 
symmetry of an a
rmchair or of t
he sofa for his 
"dear guest, but "
being apparently
 painfully unde
cided on the mat
"ter himself, eve"
ntually left the
 visitor to sett
le the question
 of selection. P
ierre disturbed 
the symmetry by 
moving a chair 
"for himself, and"
 Berg and Véra 
immediately bega
n their evening 
"
party, interrup"
ting each other 
in their efforts
 to entertain th
eir guest.  V
"éra, having dec"
ided in her own 
mind that Pierre
 ought to be en
tertained with c
onversation abou
t the French emb
"assy, at once be"
gan accordingly
". Berg, having d"
ecided that masc
uline conversati
on was required
", interrupted hi"
s wife’s remar
ks and touched o
n the question 
of the war with 
"Austria, and unc"
onsciously jumpe
d from the gener
al subject to p
ersonal consider
ations as to the
 proposals made 
him to take par
t in the Austria
n campaign and t
he reasons why h
e had declined t
hem. Though the
 conversation wa
s very incoheren
t and Véra was 
angry at the in
trusion of the m
asculine element
", both husband a"
nd wife felt wit
h satisfaction 
"that, even if on"
ly one guest was
" present, their "
evening had beg
un very well and
 was as like as 
two peas to ever
y other evening 
party with its 
"talk, tea, and l"
ighted candles. 
  Before long B
"orís, Berg’s "
"old comrade, arr"
ived. There was 
a shade of cond
escension and pa
tronage in his t
reatment of Berg
 and Véra. Afte
r Borís came a
 lady with the c
"olonel, then the"
 general himself
", then the
Rost"
"óvs, and the pa"
rty became unque
stionably exactl
y like all other
 evening partie
s. Berg and Vér
a could not repr
ess their smiles
 of satisfactio
n at the sight o
f all this movem
ent in their dra
"wing room,
at t"
he sound of the 
disconnected tal
"k, the rustling "
"of dresses, and "
the bowing and 
scraping. Everyt
hing was just as
 everybody alway
"s has it,
espec"
ially so the gen
"eral, who admire"
"d the apartment,"
 patted Berg on 
"the
shoulder, a"
nd with parental
 authority super
intended the set
ting out of the
 table for bosto
n. The general s
at down by Count
" Ilyá Rostóv, "
who was next to
 himself the mos
t important gues
t. The old peopl
e sat with the 
"old, the young w"
"ith the young, a"
nd the hostess a
"t the tea table,"
 on which stood
 exactly the sam
e kind of cakes 
in a silver cake
 basket as the 
Panins had at th
eir party. Every
thing was just a
s it was everywh
ere else.   
   CHAPTER XX
"I

Pierre, as "
one of the princ
"ipal guests, had"
 to sit down to 
boston with Cou
"nt Rostóv, the "
"general, and the"
 colonel. At the
 card table he 
happened to be d
irectly facing N
"atásha, and was"
 struck by a cur
ious change tha
t had come over 
her since the ba
ll. She was sile
"nt, and not
onl"
y less pretty th
"an at the ball, "
but only redeeme
d from plainness
 by her look of
 gentle indiffer
ence to everythi
ng around.  �
�What’s the ma
tter with her?�
� thought Pierre
", glancing at he"
r. She was sitt
ing by her siste
r at the tea tab
"le, and reluctan"
"tly, without
lo"
"oking at him, ma"
de some reply to
 Borís who sat 
down beside her.
 After playing 
out a whole suit
 and to his part
ner’s delight 
taking five tri
"cks, Pierre, hea"
ring greetings a
nd the steps of 
someone who had 
 entered the roo
m while he was p
icking up his tr
"icks, glanced ag"
ain at Natásha
.  “What has
 happened to her
?” he asked hi
mself with still
 greater surpri
se.  Prince An
drew was standin
"g before her, sa"
ying something t
o her with a lo
ok of tender sol
"icitude. She, ha"
ving raised her 
"head, was lookin"
"g up
at him, fl"
ushed and eviden
tly trying to ma
ster her rapid b
reathing. And t
he bright glow o
f some inner fir
e that had been 
suppressed was a
gain alight in 
her. She was com
pletely transfor
med and from a p
lain girl had a
gain become what
 she had been at
 the ball.  Pr
ince Andrew went
" up to Pierre, a"
nd the latter no
ticed a new and 
 youthful expres
sion in his frie
nd’s face.  
Pierre changed p
laces several ti
mes during the g
"ame, sitting now"
 with his back 
to Natásha and 
"now facing her, "
but during the w
hole of the six 
 rubbers he watc
hed her and his 
friend.  “So
mething very imp
ortant is happen
ing between them
",” thought
Pi"
"erre, and a feel"
ing that was bot
h joyful and pai
nful agitated hi
m and made him 
neglect the game
.  After six r
ubbers the gener
"al got up, sayin"
g that it was no
 use playing li
"ke that, and Pie"
rre was released
. Natásha on on
e side was talki
ng with Sónya 
"and Borís, and "
Véra with a sub
tle smile was sa
ying something 
to Prince Andrew
. Pierre went up
 to his friend a
"nd, asking
whet"
her they were ta
"lking secrets, s"
at down beside t
"hem. Véra, havi"
ng noticed Prin
ce Andrew’s at
tentions to Nat�
"�sha, decided th"
"at at a
party, "
a real evening p
"arty, subtle all"
usions to the te
nder passion wer
e absolutely ne
"cessary and, sei"
zing a moment wh
en Prince Andrew
" was alone,
beg"
an a conversatio
n with him about
 feelings in gen
eral and about h
er sister. With
 so intellectual
 a guest as she 
considered Princ
"e Andrew to
be,"
 she felt that s
he had to employ
 her diplomatic 
tact.  When Pi
erre went up to 
them he noticed 
that Véra was b
eing carried awa
y by her self-s
"atisfied talk, b"
ut that Prince A
ndrew seemed emb
"arrassed, a
thi"
ng that rarely h
appened with him
.  “What do 
you think?” V�
�ra was saying w
ith an arch smil
e. “You are s
"o discerning, Pr"
"ince, and unders"
tand people’s 
characters so we
ll at a glance.
 What do you thi
nk of Natalie? C
ould she be cons
tant in her att
achments? Could 
"she, like other "
women” (Véra 
"meant herself),"
 “love a man o
nce for all and 
remain true to h
im forever? That
 is what I cons
ider true love. 
What do you thin
"k, Prince?”
"
 “I know your 
sister too littl
"e,” replied Pr"
"ince Andrew, wit"
h a sarcastic s
mile under which
 he wished to hi
de his embarrass
"ment, “to
be "
able to solve so
 delicate a ques
"tion, and then I"
 have noticed th
at the less att
ractive a woman 
is the more cons
tant she is like
"ly to be,”
he"
" added, and look"
ed up at Pierre 
who was just app
roaching them. 
"
“Yes, that i"
"s true, Prince. "
"In our days,” "
continued Véra
—mentioning �
�our days” as 
people of limite
d intelligence a
re fond of doin
"g, imagining tha"
t they have disc
overed and appra
ised the peculi
arities of “ou
r days” and th
at human charact
eristics change 
 with the times�
��“in our days
 a girl has so m
uch freedom that
 the pleasure o
f being courted 
often stifles re
al feeling in he
r. And it must 
be confessed tha
t Natalie is ver
y susceptible.�
� This return to
 the subject of
 Natalie caused 
Prince Andrew to
 knit his brows 
with discomfort
: he was about t
"o rise, but Vér"
a continued with
 a still more s
ubtle smile:  
“I think no on
e has been more 
courted than she
",” she went on"
", “but
till q"
uite lately she 
never cared seri
ously for anyone
". Now you know,"
"
Count,” she s"
"aid to Pierre, �"
��even our dear 
"cousin Borís, w"
"ho,
between our"
"selves, was very"
 far gone in the
 land of tendern
ess...” (allu
ding to a map of
 love much in vo
gue at that time
).  Prince And
rew frowned and 
remained silent.
  “You are f
riendly with Bor
"ís, aren’t yo"
u?” asked Vér
"a.

“Yes, I "
know him....” 
  “I expect h
e has told you o
f his childish l
ove for Natásha
"?”

“Oh, t"
here was childis
h love?” sudde
nly asked Prince
" Andrew,
blushi"
ng unexpectedly.
"

“Yes, you "
know between cou
sins intimacy of
ten leads to lov
e. Le cousinage
 est un dangereu
x voisinage. * D
on’t you think
 so?”      *
 “Cousinhood i
s a dangerous ne
ighborhood.” 
"

“Oh, undou"
btedly!” said 
"Prince Andrew, a"
nd with sudden a
nd unnatural li
veliness he bega
n chaffing Pierr
e about the need
 to be very care
ful with his fi
fty-year-old Mos
"cow cousins, and"
 in the midst of
 these jesting 
"remarks he rose,"
 taking Pierre b
"y the arm, and d"
rew him aside. 
 “Well?” as
"ked Pierre, seei"
ng his friend’
s strange animat
ion with surpri
"se, and noticing"
 the glance he t
urned on Natásh
a as he rose.  
 “I must... I 
must have a talk
" with you,” sa"
id Prince Andrew
. “You know t
hat pair of wome
n’s gloves?”
 (He referred to
 the Masonic gl
oves given to a 
newly initiated 
Brother to prese
nt to the woman 
he loved.) “I
"... but no, I wi"
ll talk to you l
"ater on,” and "
with a strange 
light in his eye
s and restlessne
ss in his moveme
"nts, Prince
And"
rew approached N
atásha and sat 
down beside her.
 Pierre saw how 
 Prince Andrew a
sked her somethi
ng and how she f
lushed as she re
plied.  But at
 that moment Ber
g came to Pierre
 and began insis
ting that he sh
ould take part i
n an argument be
tween the genera
l and the colone
l on the affair
s in Spain.  B
erg was satisfie
d and happy. The
 smile of pleasu
re never left hi
s face. The par
ty was very succ
essful and quite
 like other part
ies he had seen
. Everything was
 similar: the la
dies’ subtle t
"alk, the cards, "
the general rai
sing his voice a
t the card table
", and the samova"
r and the tea c
akes; only one t
hing was lacking
 that he had alw
ays seen at the 
evening parties
 he wished to im
itate. They had 
not yet had a lo
ud conversation 
 among the men a
nd a dispute abo
ut something imp
ortant and cleve
r. Now the gene
ral had begun su
ch a discussion 
and so Berg drew
 Pierre to it. 
     CHAPTE
R XXII  Next d
"ay, having been "
invited by the c
"ount, Prince And"
rew dined with t
he Rostóvs and
 spent the rest 
of the day there
.  Everyone in
 the house reali
zed for whose sa
ke Prince Andrew
" came, and
with"
out concealing i
t he tried to be
 with Natásha a
ll day. Not only
 in the soul of
 the frightened 
yet happy and en
raptured Natásh
"a, but in the
w"
"hole house, ther"
e was a feeling 
of awe at someth
ing important th
at was bound to
 happen. The cou
ntess looked wit
h sad and sternl
y serious eyes 
at Prince Andrew
 when he talked 
to Natásha and 
timidly started 
some artificial
 conversation ab
out trifles as s
oon as he looked
 her way. Sóny
a was afraid to 
leave Natásha a
nd afraid of bei
ng in the way wh
en she was with
 them. Natásha 
"grew pale, in a "
panic of expecta
"tion, when
she "
remained alone w
ith him for a mo
ment. Prince And
rew surprised he
r by his timidi
ty. She felt tha
t he wanted to s
ay something to 
her but could n
ot bring himself
 to do so.  In
" the evening, wh"
en Prince Andrew
" had left, the c"
ountess went up 
to Natásha and
 whispered: “W
"ell, what?”
"
 “Mamma! For h
eaven’s sake d
on’t ask me an
ything now! One 
can’t talk ab
"out that,” sai"
d Natásha.  B
ut all the same 
that night Natá
"sha, now agitate"
d and now fright
"ened,
lay a lon"
g time in her mo
ther’s bed gaz
ing straight bef
ore her. She to
ld her how he ha
d complimented h
"er, how he told "
her he was going
"
abroad, asked "
her where they w
ere going to spe
"nd the summer, a"
nd then how he 
had asked her ab
out Borís.  �
��But such a... 
such a... never 
happened to me b
efore!” she sa
id. “Only I f
eel afraid in hi
s presence. I am
 always afraid w
hen I’m with 
him. What does t
hat mean? Does i
t mean that it�
�s the real thin
"g?
Yes? Mamma, "
are you asleep?�
"��

“No, my "
love; I am frigh
"tened myself,”"
 answered her mo
ther. “Now go
!”  “All t
he same I shan�
�t sleep. What s
"illiness, to sle"
ep! Mummy! Mumm
y! such a thing 
never happened t
"o me before,” "
"she said, surpri"
sed and alarmed
 at the feeling 
she was aware of
 in herself. “
And could we ev
er have thought!
...”  It see
med to Natásha 
that even at the
 time she first 
saw Prince Andre
w at Otrádnoe 
she had fallen i
n love with him.
 It was as if sh
e feared this s
"trange, unexpect"
ed happiness of 
meeting again th
e very man she h
ad then chosen 
(she was firmly 
convinced she ha
d done so) and o
"f finding
him, "
"as it seemed, no"
t indifferent to
 her.  “And 
it had to happen
 that he should 
come specially t
o Petersburg wh
ile we are here.
 And it had to h
appen that we sh
ould meet at tha
t ball. It is f
ate. Clearly it 
is fate that eve
rything led up t
o this! Already
" then, directly "
I saw him I felt
 something pecul
iar.”  “Wh
at else did he s
ay to you? What 
are those verses
? Read them...�
� said her moth
"er, thoughtfully"
", referring to s"
ome verses Princ
e Andrew had wr
itten in Natásh
a’s album.  
"“Mamma, one ne"
ed not be ashame
d of his being a
 widower?”  
"“Don’t, Nat�"
�sha! Pray to Go
d. ‘Marriages 
are made in hea
"ven,’” said "
her mother.  �
"��Darling Mummy,"
 how I love you!
 How happy I am!
” cried Natás
"ha,
shedding te"
ars of joy and e
xcitement and em
bracing her moth
er.  At that v
ery time Prince 
Andrew was sitti
ng with Pierre a
nd telling him 
of his love for 
Natásha and his
 firm resolve to
 make her his wi
fe.  That day 
Countess Hélèn
e had a receptio
n at her house. 
The French amba
ssador was there
", and a foreign "
prince of the bl
ood who had of 
late become a fr
equent visitor o
"f hers, and many"
 brilliant ladie
s and gentlemen
". Pierre, who ha"
d come downstair
"s, walked throug"
h the rooms and 
 struck everyone
 by his preoccup
"ied, absent-mind"
"ed, and morose a"
ir.  Since the
 ball he had fel
t the approach o
f a fit of nervo
us depression a
nd had made desp
erate efforts to
 combat it. Sinc
e the intimacy o
f his wife with
 the royal princ
"e, Pierre had un"
expectedly been 
made a gentlema
n of the bedcham
"ber, and from th"
at time he had b
egun to feel op
pressed and asha
med in court soc
"iety, and dark t"
houghts of the v
anity of all th
ings human came 
to him oftener t
han before. At t
he same time th
e feeling he had
 noticed between
 his protégée 
Natásha and Pri
nce Andrew acce
ntuated his gloo
m by the contras
t between his ow
n position and 
his friend’s. 
He tried equally
 to avoid thinki
ng about his wif
"e,
and about Na"
tásha and Princ
e Andrew; and ag
ain everything s
eemed to him in
significant in c
omparison with e
ternity; again t
he question: for
 what? presente
d itself; and he
 forced himself 
to work day and 
night at Masonic
"
labors, hoping"
 to drive away t
he evil spirit t
hat threatened h
im. Toward midn
"ight, after he h"
ad left the coun
tess’ apartmen
"ts, he was sitti"
ng upstairs in 
a shabby dressin
"g gown, copying "
out the original
 transaction of
 the Scottish lo
dge of Freemason
s at a table in 
his low room clo
udy with tobacc
"o smoke, when so"
meone came in. I
t was Prince And
"rew.

“Ah, i"
t’s you!” sa
id Pierre with a
" preoccupied, di"
ssatisfied air. 
"
“And I, you s"
"ee, am hard at i"
t.” He pointed
 to his manuscri
pt book with th
at air of escapi
ng from the ills
 of life with wh
ich unhappy peo
ple look at thei
r work.  Princ
"e Andrew, with a"
" beaming, ecstat"
ic expression of
 renewed life on
"
his face, paus"
ed in front of P
"ierre and, not n"
oticing his sad 
"look,
smiled at"
 him with the eg
otism of joy.  
"
“Well, dear h"
"eart,” said he"
", “I wanted to"
 tell you about 
it yesterday an
d I have come to
 do so today. I 
never experience
d anything like
 it before. I am
" in love, my fri"
end!”  Sudde
nly Pierre heave
d a deep sigh an
d dumped his hea
vy person down o
n the sofa besi
de Prince Andrew
.  “With Nat
"ásha Rostóva, "
yes?” said he.
"

“Yes, yes!"
 Who else should
 it be? I should
 never have beli
"eved it,
but th"
e feeling is str
onger than I. Ye
sterday I tormen
ted myself and 
"suffered, but I "
would not exchan
ge even that tor
ment for anythin
"g in
the world,"
 I have not live
d till now. At l
"ast I live, but "
I can’t live 
without her! But
 can she love me
?... I am too ol
d for her.... Wh
y don’t you s
peak?”  “I
? I? What did I 
tell you?” sai
d Pierre suddenl
"y, rising and
b"
eginning to pace
 up and down the
 room. “I alwa
ys thought it...
. That girl is 
such a treasure.
.. she is a rare
 girl.... My dea
"r friend,
I ent"
"reat you, don’"
"t philosophize, "
"don’t doubt, m"
"arry, marry,
ma"
rry.... And I am
 sure there will
 not be a happie
r man than you.�
��  “But wha
t of her?”  
“She loves you
.”  “Don�
�t talk rubbish.
..” said Princ
"e Andrew, smilin"
g and looking i
nto Pierre’s e
yes.  “She d
"oes, I know,” "
Pierre cried fie
rcely.  “But
" do listen,” r"
eturned Prince A
"ndrew, holding h"
im by the arm. 
“Do you know t
he condition I a
m in? I must tal
k about it to s
omeone.”  �
"�Well, go on, go"
 on. I am very g
"lad,” said Pie"
"rre, and his fac"
e really change
"d, his brow beca"
"me smooth, and h"
e listened gladl
y to Prince And
rew. Prince Andr
"ew seemed, and r"
"eally was, quite"
" a different, qu"
ite a new man. 
Where was his sp
"leen, his contem"
"pt for life, his"
 disillusionmen
t? Pierre was th
e only person to
 whom he made up
 his mind to sp
eak openly; and 
to him he told a
ll that was in h
is soul. Now he 
 boldly and ligh
tly made plans f
or an extended f
"uture, said he c"
ould not sacrif
ice his own happ
iness to his fat
"her’s caprice,"
 and spoke of ho
w he would eith
er make his fath
er consent to th
is marriage and 
"love her,
or wo"
uld do without h
is consent; then
 he marveled at 
the feeling that
 had mastered h
im as at somethi
"ng strange, apar"
t from and indep
endent of himse
lf.  “I shou
ld not have beli
eved anyone who 
told me that I w
as capable of s
"uch love,” sai"
d Prince Andrew.
 “It is not at
 all the same fe
eling that I kn
ew in the past. 
The whole world 
is now for me di
vided into two 
halves: one half
" is she, and the"
"re all is joy, h"
"ope, light: the"
 other half is e
verything where 
"she is not, and "
there is all glo
om and darkness
....”  “Da
rkness and gloom
",” reiterated "
"Pierre: “yes, "
"yes, I understan"
d that.”  �
��I cannot help 
loving the light

ault. And I am v
ery happy! You 
understand me? I
 know you are gl
ad for my sake.�
"��

“Yes, ye"
"s,” Pierre ass"
"ented, looking a"
t his friend wit
h a touched and
 sad expression 
in his eyes. The
 brighter Prince
 Andrew’s lot 
 appeared to him
", the gloomier s"
eemed his own. 
     CHAPTE
R XXIII  Princ
e Andrew needed 
his father’s c

opting a quiet t
"one, discussed t"
he whole matter
.  In the firs
t place the marr
iage was not a b
rilliant one as 
"regards
birth, "
"wealth, or rank."
" Secondly, Princ"
e Andrew was no 
longer as young 
 as he had been 
and his health w
as poor (the old
 man laid specia
l stress on thi
"s), while she wa"
s very young. Th
"irdly, he had a "
son whom it woul
d be a pity to 
entrust to a chi
t of a girl. “
Fourthly and fin
"ally,”
the fa"
"ther said, looki"
ng ironically at
" his son, “I b"
eg you to put it
 off for a year
": go abroad, tak"
"e a cure, look o"
ut as you wanted
 to for a Germa
n tutor for Prin
ce Nicholas. The
n if your love o
r passion or ob
stinacy—as you
 please—is sti
"ll as great, mar"
ry! And that’s
 my last word o
"n it. Mind, the "
last...” concl
"uded the prince,"
 in a tone whic
h showed that no
thing would make
 him alter his d
ecision.  Prin
ce Andrew saw cl
early that the o
ld man hoped tha
"t his feelings, "
or his fiancée
"’s, would not "
stand a year’s
" test, or that h"
e (the old prin
ce himself) woul
d die before the
"n, and he decide"
d to conform to 
his father’s 
wish—to propos
"e, and postpone "
the wedding for 
a year.  Three
 weeks after the
 last evening he
 had spent with 
"the Rostóvs,
P"
rince Andrew ret
urned to Petersb
urg.   Next d
ay after her tal
k with her mothe
r Natásha expec
ted Bolkónski a
"ll
day, but he "
did not come. On
 the second and 
third day it was
 the same. Pier
re did not come 
either and Natá
"sha, not knowing"
 that Prince And
rew had gone to
" see his father,"
 could not expla
in his absence t
o herself.  Th
ree weeks passed
 in this way. Na
tásha had no de
sire to go out 
anywhere and wan
dered from room 
to room like a s
"hadow, idle and"
 listless; she w
ept secretly at 
night and did no
t go to her moth
er in the eveni
ngs. She blushed
 continually and
 was irritable. 
It seemed to her
 that everybody
 knew about her 
disappointment a
nd was laughing 
at her and pity
ing her. Strong 
as was her inwar
"d grief, this wo"
und to her vanit
y intensified h
er misery.  On
ce she came to h
"er mother, tried"
 to say somethin
"g, and suddenly "
began to cry. H
er tears were th
ose of an offend
ed child who doe
s not know why 
it is being puni
shed.  The cou
ntess began to s
"oothe Natásha, "
who after first 
listening to her
 mother’s wor
"ds, suddenly int"
errupted her:  
"
“Leave off, M"
amma! I don’t 
"think, and don�"
�t want to think
 about it! He j
ust came and the
"n left off, left"
 off....”  H
er voice tremble
"d, and she again"
" nearly cried, b"
ut recovered and
 went on quietl
y:  “And I d
on’t at all wa
nt to get marrie
d. And I am afra
id of him; I ha
ve now become qu
"ite calm, quite "
calm.”  The 
day after this c
onversation Nat�
�sha put on the 
old dress which 
 she knew had th
e peculiar prope
rty of conducing
 to cheerfulness
 in the morning
"s, and that day "
she returned to 
the old way of l
ife which she ha
d abandoned sin
ce the ball. Hav
ing finished her
 morning tea she
 went to the ba
"llroom, which sh"
e particularly l
iked for its lou
"d resonance, and"
 began singing 
her solfeggio. W
hen she had fini
shed her first e
xercise she sto
od still in the 
middle of the ro
om and sang a mu
sical phrase tha
t particularly 
pleased her. She
 listened joyful
ly (as though sh
e had not expec
ted it) to the c
harm of the note
"s reverberating,"
 filling the wh
ole empty ballro
"om, and slowly d"
ying away; and a
ll at once she f
elt cheerful. �
��What’s the g
ood of making so
 much of it? Thi
ngs are nice as
" it is,” she s"
"aid to herself, "
and she began wa
lking up and dow
"n the
room, not"
 stepping simply
 on the resoundi
ng parquet but t
reading with ea
ch step from the
 heel to the toe
 (she had on a n
ew and favorite 
pair of shoes) 
and listening to
 the regular tap
 of the heel and
 creak of the t
oe as gladly as 
she had to the s
ounds of her own
 voice. Passing 
a mirror she gl
anced into it. �
"��There, that’"
s me!” the exp
ression of her 
face seemed to s
ay as she caught
 sight of hersel
"f. “Well, and "
very nice too! 
I need nobody.�
�  A footman w
anted to come in
 to clear away s
omething in the 
room but she wo
"uld not let him,"
 and having clos
ed the door behi
nd him continued
 her walk. That
 morning she had
 returned to her
 favorite mood�
"�love of,
and d"
"elight in, herse"
lf. “How charm
ing that Natásh
a is!” she sai
"d
again, speaki"
ng as some third
", collective, ma"
le person. “Pr
"etty,
a good vo"
"ice, young, and "
in nobody’s wa
y if only they l
eave her in pea
ce.” But howev
er much they lef
t her in peace s
he could not now
" be
at peace, a"
nd immediately f
elt this.  In 
the hall the por
"ch door opened, "
and someone aske
"d, “At home?�"
� and then foot
steps were heard
. Natásha was l
ooking at the mi
"rror, but did
n"
ot see herself. 
She listened to 
the sounds in th
e hall. When she
" saw
herself, h"
er face was pale
. It was he. She
 knew this for c
"ertain, though
"
she hardly heard
 his voice throu
gh the closed do
ors.  Pale and
" agitated, Natá"
sha ran into the
 drawing room. 
 “Mamma! Bolk
ónski has come!
” she said. �
"�Mamma, it is aw"
"ful, it is
unbe"
arable! I don’
t want... to be 
tormented? What 
am I to do?...�
�  Before the 
countess could a
"nswer, Prince An"
drew entered the
 room with an a
gitated and seri
ous face. As soo
n as he saw Nat�
�sha his face b
rightened. He ki
ssed the countes
s’ hand and Na
"tásha’s, and "
sat down beside
 the sofa.  �
�It is long sinc
e we had the ple
asure...” bega
"n the countess,"
 but Prince Andr
ew interrupted h
er by answering 
her intended que
"stion,
obviousl"
y in haste to sa
y what he had to
.  “I have n
ot been to see y
ou all this time
 because I have 
been at my fath
er’s. I had to
 talk over a ver
y important matt
er with him. I o
nly got back la
"st night,” he "
said glancing at
 Natásha; “I 
want to have a 
"talk with you, C"
"ountess,” he a"
dded after a mom
ent’s pause. 
 The countess l
"owered her eyes,"
 sighing deeply.
  “I am at y
"our disposal,”"
 she murmured. 
 Natásha knew 
that she ought t
"o go away, but w"
as unable to do 
so: something g
ripped her throa
"t, and regardles"
s of manners she
 stared straigh
t at Prince Andr
ew with wide-ope
n eyes.  “At
 once? This inst
"ant!... No, it c"
an’t be!” sh
e thought.  Ag
ain he glanced a
"t her, and that "
glance convinced
 her that she wa
s not mistaken.
" Yes, at once, t"
hat very instant
", her fate would"
 be decided.  
"“Go, Natásha!"
 I will call you
",” said the co"
untess in a whis
per.  Natásha
 glanced with fr
ightened implori
ng eyes at Princ
e Andrew and at 
 her mother and 
went out.  “
"I have come, Cou"
"ntess, to ask fo"
r your daughter�
"��s hand,” sai"
d Prince Andrew
.  The countes
s’ face flushe
"d hotly, but she"
 said nothing. 
 “Your offer.
..” she began 
at last sedately
. He remained si
"lent,
looking i"
nto her eyes. �
�Your offer...�
� (she grew conf
used) “is agr
"eeable to us, an"
d I accept your 
offer. I am glad
. And my husband
... I hope... b
ut it will depen
d on her....” 
  “I will spe
ak to her when I
 have your conse
nt.... Do you gi
ve it to me?”
 said Prince And
"rew.

“Yes,�"
�� replied the c
ountess. She hel
d out her hand t
"o him, and with"
 a mixed feeling
 of estrangement
 and tenderness 
pressed her lips
 to his forehea
d as he stooped 
to kiss her hand
. She wished to 
love him as a s
"on, but felt tha"
t to her he was 
a stranger and a
 terrifying man.
 “I am sure m
y husband will c
"onsent,” said "
"the countess, �"
�but your fathe
r...”  “My
" father, to whom"
 I have told my 
"plans, has made "
it an express c
ondition of his 
consent that the
 wedding is not 
to take place fo
r a year. And I
 wished to tell 
"you of that,” "
said Prince Andr
ew.  “It is 
true that Natás
ha is still youn
"g, but—so long"
 as that?...” 
  “It is unav
"oidable,” said"
 Prince Andrew w
ith a sigh.  �
��I will send he
"r to you,” sai"
"d the countess, "
and left the roo
m.  “Lord ha
ve mercy upon us
!” she repeate
d while seeking 
her daughter.  
 Sónya said tha
t Natásha was i
n her bedroom. N
atásha was sitt
"ing on
the bed,"
 pale and dry-ey
"ed, and was gazi"
ng at the icons 
and whispering 
something as she
 rapidly crossed
 herself. Seeing
 her mother she 
jumped up and f
lew to her.  �
"��Well, Mamma?.."
. Well?...”  
"
“Go, go to hi"
m. He is asking 
"for your hand,�"
� said the count
"ess,
coldly it "
seemed to Natás
"ha. “Go... go,"
” said the mot
"her, sadly and
"
"reproachfully, w"
"ith a deep sigh,"
 as her daughter
 ran away.  Na
tásha never rem
embered how she 
entered the draw
ing room. When s
he came in and 
saw him she paus
ed. “Is it pos
sible that this 
stranger has no
w become everyth
ing to me?” sh
"e asked herself,"
 and immediately
"
answered, “Y"
"es, everything! "
He alone is now 
dearer to me tha
n everything in
 the world.” P
rince Andrew cam
e up to her with
 downcast eyes.
  “I have lo
ved you from the
 very first mome
nt I saw you. Ma
y I hope?”  
He looked at her
 and was struck 
by the serious i
mpassioned expre
ssion of her fa
ce. Her face sai
d: “Why ask? W
hy doubt what yo
u cannot but kno
"w?
Why speak, w"
hen words cannot
 express what on
e feels?”  S
he drew near to 
him and stopped.
 He took her han
d and kissed it.
  “Do you lo
ve me?”  “
"Yes, yes!” Nat"
ásha murmured a
s if in vexation
. Then she sighe
"d
loudly and, c"
atching her brea
th more and more
" quickly, began "
to sob.  “Wh
at is it? What�
�s the matter?�
"�

“Oh, I am"
 so happy!” sh
"e replied, smile"
d through her te
"ars, bent
over "
"closer to him, p"
aused for an ins
tant as if askin
g herself whethe
"r
she might, an"
d then kissed hi
m.  Prince And
rew held her han
"ds, looked into "
"her eyes, and di"
d not find in h
is heart his for
mer love for her
. Something in h
im had suddenly 
 changed; there 
was no longer th
e former poetic 
and mystic charm
" of
desire, but"
 there was pity 
for her feminine
 and childish we
"akness, fear
at"
 her devotion an
"d trustfulness, "
and an oppressiv
e yet joyful sen
se of the duty 
that now bound h
im to her foreve
r. The present f
"eeling, though
"
not so bright an
d poetic as the 
"former, was stro"
nger and more se
rious.  “Did
 your mother tel
l you that it ca
nnot be for a ye
ar?” asked Pr
"ince Andrew, sti"
ll looking into 
her eyes.  “
Is it possible t
hat I—the ‘c
"hit of a girl,�"
� as everybody c
"alled
me,” th"
ought Natásha�
�“is it possib
le that I am now
 to be the wife
 and the equal o
"f this strange, "
"dear, clever man"
 whom even my fa
ther looks up t

e? Can it be tru
e that there can
 be no more pla

that now I am gr
"own up, that on "
me now lies a r
esponsibility fo
r my every word 
"and deed? Yes, b"
ut what did he a

"�No,” she repl"
"ied, but she had"
 not understood 
his question.  
 “Forgive me!�
�� he said. “B
ut you are so yo
"ung, and I have "
already been th
rough so much in
 life. I am afra
"id for you, you "
do not yet know 
 yourself.”  
 Natásha listen
ed with concentr
"ated attention, "
trying but faili
ng to take in t
he meaning of hi
s words.  “H
ard as this year
 which delays my
 happiness will 
"be,” continued"
"
Prince Andrew,"
 “it will give
 you time to be 
sure of yourself
. I ask you to 
make me happy in
" a year, but you"
 are free: our e
ngagement shall 
 remain a secret
", and should you"
 find that you d
"o not love me, o"
r should you co
me to love...”
 said Prince And
rew with an unna
tural smile.  
“Why do you sa
y that?” Natá
sha interrupted 
him. “You know
 that from the 
very day you fir
st came to Otrá
dnoe I have love
"d you,” she
c"
"ried, quite conv"
inced that she s
poke the truth. 
  “In a year 
you will learn t
o know yourself.
...”  “A w
hole year!” Na
tásha repeated 
"suddenly, only n"
ow realizing tha
t the marriage 
was to be postpo
ned for a year. 
“But why a yea
r? Why a year?.
..”  Prince 
Andrew began to 
explain to her t
he reasons for t
his delay. Nat�
�sha did not hea
r him.  “And
 can’t it be h
elped?” she as
ked. Prince Andr
ew did not reply
",
but his face "
expressed the im
possibility of a
ltering that dec
ision.  “It�
"��s awful! Oh, i"
t’s awful! awf
ul!” Natásha 
"suddenly cried,"
 and again burst
 into sobs. “I
" shall die, wait"
ing a year: it�
"�s
impossible, "
it’s awful!”
 She looked into
 her lover’s f
ace and saw in 
it a look of com
miseration and p
erplexity.  �
"�No, no! I’ll "
do anything!” 
"she said, sudden"
ly checking her 
tears. “I am 
so happy.”  
The father and m
other came into 
the room and gav
e the betrothed 
couple their bl
essing.  From 
that day Prince 
Andrew began to 
frequent the Ros
tóvs’ as Nat
ásha’s affian
ced lover.   
   CHAPTER XX
IV  No betroth
al ceremony took
 place and Natá
sha’s engageme
nt to Bolkónsk
i was not announ
ced; Prince Andr
ew insisted on t
hat. He said th
at as he was res
ponsible for the
 delay he ought 
to bear the whol
e burden of it;
 that he had giv
en his word and 
bound himself fo
"rever, but
that"
 he did not wish
 to bind Natásh
a and gave her p
erfect freedom. 
If after six mo
nths she felt th
at she did not l
ove him she woul
d have full rig
ht to reject him
. Naturally neit
her Natásha nor
 her parents wis
hed to hear of 
"this, but Prince"
 Andrew was firm
. He came every 
day to the Rost
"óvs’, but did"
 not behave to N
atásha as an af
fianced lover: h
e did not use t
he familiar thou
", but said you t"
"o her, and kisse"
d only her hand
. After their en
"gagement, quite "
"different, intim"
"ate, and natural"
 relations spra
ng up between th
em. It was as if
 they had not kn
own each other 
till now. Both l
iked to recall h
ow they had rega
rded each other 
 when as yet the
y were nothing t
o one another; t
hey felt themsel
ves now quite d
ifferent beings:
 then they were 
"artificial, now "
natural and sin
cere. At first t
he family felt s
ome constraint i
n intercourse wi
th Prince Andre
w; he seemed a m
an from another 
"world, and for a"
 long time Nat�
�sha trained the
 family to get u
"sed to him, prou"
dly assuring the
m all that he o
nly appeared to 
"be different, bu"
t was really jus
t like all of t
"hem, and that sh"
e was not afraid
 of him and no o
ne else ought to
 be. After a fe
w days they grew
 accustomed to h
"im, and without "
restraint in hi
s presence pursu
ed their usual w
"ay of life, in w"
hich he took his
 part. He could
 talk about rura
l economy with t
"he count, fashio"
ns with the cou
ntess and Natás
"ha, and about al"
bums and fancywo
rk with Sónya. 
 Sometimes the h
ousehold both am
ong themselves a
nd in his presen
ce expressed th
eir wonder at ho
w it had all hap
"pened, and at th"
e evident omens
 there had been 
of it: Prince An
drew’s coming 
to Otrádnoe and
 their coming t
"o Petersburg, an"
d the likeness b
etween Natásha 
and Prince Andr
ew which her nur
se had noticed o
n his first visi
"t, and Andrew’"
s encounter wit
h Nicholas in 18
"05, and many oth"
er incidents bet
okening that it
 had to be.  I
n the house that
 poetic dullness
 and quiet reign
ed which always 
 accompanies the
 presence of a b
etrothed couple.
 Often when all 
sitting togethe
r everyone kept 
silent. Sometime
s the others wou
ld get up and g
o away and the c
"ouple, left alon"
"e, still remaine"
d silent. They r
arely spoke of 
their future lif
e. Prince Andrew
 was afraid and 
ashamed to spea
k of it. Natásh
a shared this as
 she did all his
" feelings, which"
 she constantly
 divined. Once s
he began questio
ning him about h
is son. Prince 
"Andrew blushed, "
as he often did 
now—Natásha p
articularly like
d it in him—a
nd said that his
 son would not l
ive with them. 
 “Why not?”
 asked Natásha 
in a frightened 
tone.  “I ca
nnot take him aw
ay from his gran
"dfather, and bes"
ides...”  �
�How I should ha
ve loved him!”
" said Natásha, "
immediately gues
sing his though
t; “but I know
 you wish to avo
id any pretext f
or finding faul
t with us.”  
 Sometimes the o
ld count would c
"ome up, kiss Pri"
"nce Andrew, and "
ask his advice 
about Pétya’s
 education or Ni
cholas’ servic
e. The old coun
tess sighed as s
he looked at the
m; Sónya was al
ways getting fr
ightened lest sh
e should be in t
he way and tried
 to find excuses
 for leaving th
"em alone, even w"
hen they did not
 wish it. When P
rince Andrew sp
oke (he could te
ll a story very 
"well), Natásha "
listened to him 
 with pride; whe
n she spoke she 
noticed with fea
r and joy that h
e gazed attenti
vely and scrutin
izingly at her. 
She asked hersel
f in perplexity:
 “What does h
e look for in me
? He is trying t
o discover somet
hing by looking
 at me! What if 
what he seeks in
 me is not there
?” Sometimes 
she fell into on
"e of the mad, me"
rry moods charac
"teristic of her,"
 and then she p
articularly love
d to hear and se
e how Prince And
rew laughed. He
" seldom laughed,"
 but when he did
 he abandoned hi
mself entirely t
"o his
laughter,"
 and after such 
a laugh she alwa
ys felt nearer t
o him. Natásha 
 would have been
 completely happ
y if the thought
 of the separati
on awaiting her
 and drawing nea
r had not terrif
"ied her, just as"
 the mere thoug
ht of it made hi
m turn pale and 
cold.  On the 
eve of his depar
ture from Peters
burg Prince Andr
ew brought with 
"
him Pierre, who"
 had not been to
 the Rostóvs’
 once since the 
ball. Pierre se
emed disconcerte
d and embarrasse
d. He was talkin
g to the counte
"ss, and Natásha"
 sat down beside
 a little chess 
table with Sóny
"a,
thereby invi"
ting Prince Andr
ew to come too. 
He did so.  �
�You have known 
Bezúkhov a long
 time?” he ask
ed. “Do you li
ke him?”  �
"��Yes, he’s a "
"dear, but very a"
bsurd.”  And
 as usual when s
peaking of Pierr
"e, she began to "
tell anecdotes o
f his absent-mi
"ndedness, some o"
f which had even
 been invented a
bout him.  “
Do you know I ha
ve entrusted him
 with our secret
? I have known h
im from childho
od. He has a hea
rt of gold. I be
"g you, Natalie,�"
�� Prince Andre
w said with sudd
en seriousness�
�“I am going a
way and heaven 
knows what may h
appen. You may c
ease to... all r
"ight, I know I a"
m not to say th
"at. Only this, t"
hen: whatever ma
y happen to you 
when I am not h
ere...”  “
What can happen?
”  “Whatev
er trouble may c
"ome,” Prince A"
"ndrew continued,"
" “I beg
you, "
Mademoiselle Sop
"hie, whatever ma"
"y happen, to tur"
n to him alone f
or advice and h
elp! He is a mos
t absent-minded 
and absurd fello
"w, but he
has a"
 heart of gold.�
��  Neither he
"r father, nor he"
"r mother, nor S�"
"�nya, nor Prince"
 Andrew himself
 could have fore
seen how the sep
aration from her
 lover would act
 on Natásha. F
lushed and agita
ted she went abo
ut the house all
" that day,
dry-"
"eyed, occupied w"
ith most trivial
 matters as if n
ot understanding
 what awaited h
er. She did not 
"even cry when, o"
"n taking leave, "
he kissed her h
and for the last
 time. “Don’
t go!” she sai
d in a tone tha
t made him wonde
r whether he rea
lly ought not to
 stay and which 
he remembered l
ong afterwards. 
Nor did she cry 
when he was gone
; but for sever
al days she sat 
in her room dry-
"eyed, taking no "
interest in any
thing and only s
aying now and th
"en, “Oh, why d"
id he go away?�
�  But a fortn
ight after his d
"eparture, to the"
 surprise of tho
"se around
her, "
she recovered fr

icholas Bolkón
ski’s health a
nd temper became
 much worse. He 
grew still more 
"
irritable, and "
it was Princess 
Mary who general
ly bore the brun
t of his freque
nt fits of unpro
voked anger. He 
seemed carefully
 to seek out he
r tender spots s
o as to torture 
her mentally as 
harshly as possi
ble. Princess M
ary had two pass
ions and consequ
ently two joys�
"�her nephew,
li"
"ttle Nicholas, a"
nd religion—an
d these were the
 favorite subjec
ts of the princ
e’s attacks an
d ridicule. What
ever was spoken 
of he would bri
ng round to the 
superstitiousnes
"s of old maids, "
or the petting 
and spoiling of 
children. “You
 want to make hi
m”—little N
icholas—“int
o an old maid li
ke yourself! A p
ity! Prince Andr
ew wants a son 
and not an old m
"aid,” he would"
" say. Or, turnin"
g to Mademoisel
"le Bourienne, he"
 would ask her i
n Princess Mary�
��s presence ho
w she liked our 
village priests 
and icons and wo
uld joke about t
hem.  He conti
nually hurt Prin
cess Mary’s fe
elings and torme
"nted her, but it"
 cost her no ef
fort to forgive 
him. Could he be
 to blame toward
" her, or
could "
"her father, whom"
 she knew loved 
her in spite of 
"it all, be unjus"
t? And what is 
justice? The pri
ncess never thou
ght of that prou
d word “justi
ce.” All the c
omplex laws of m
an centered for 
her in one clear
 and simple law
—the law of lo
ve and self-sacr
ifice taught us 
by Him who lovi
ngly suffered fo
r mankind though
 He Himself was 
God. What had sh
e to do with th
e justice or inj
ustice of other 
people? She had 
to endure and l
"ove, and that sh"
e did.  During
 the winter Prin
ce Andrew had co
me to Bald Hills
 and had been ga
"y,
gentle, and "
more affectionat
e than Princess 
Mary had known h
im for a long t
ime past. She fe
lt that somethin
g had happened t
"o him, but he sa"
id nothing to h
er about his lov
e. Before he lef
t he had a long 
talk with his f
ather about some
"thing, and Princ"
ess Mary noticed
 that before his
 departure they
 were dissatisfi
ed with one anot
her.  Soon aft
er Prince Andrew
" had gone, Princ"
ess Mary wrote t
o her friend Ju
lie Karágina in
" Petersburg, who"
m she had dreame
d (as all girls 
dream) of marry
ing to her broth
"er, and who was "
at that time in 
mourning for her
"
own brother, k"
illed in Turkey.
"

Sorrow, it s"
"eems, is our com"
"mon lot, my dear"
", tender friend "
Julie.  Your l
oss is so terrib
le that I can on
ly explain it to
 myself as a sp
ecial providence
" of God who, lov"
"ing you, wishes "
to try you and y
our excellent m
"other. Oh, my fr"
"iend! Religion, "
and religion alo
"ne, can—I
wil"
l not say comfor
t us—but save 
us from despair.
 Religion alone 
can explain to 
us what without 
its help man can
not comprehend: 
"why, for what
c"
"ause, kind and n"
oble beings able
 to find happine
ss in life—not
 merely harming
 no one but nece
ssary to the hap
piness of others
—are called a
"way to God, whil"
"e cruel, useless"
", harmful person"
"s, or such as ar"
e a burden to t
hemselves and to
" others, are lef"
t living. The fi
rst death I saw
", and one I shal"
l never forget�
�that of my dear
 sister-in-law�
�left that impr
ession on me. Ju
st as you ask de
stiny why your s
plendid brother 
"
had to die, so "
I asked why that
" angel Lise, who"
 not only never 
"wronged
anyone,"
 but in whose so
ul there were ne
ver any unkind t
"houghts, had to"
 die. And what d
"o you think, dea"
r friend? Five y
ears have passed
" since
then, an"
"d already I, wit"
h my petty under
"standing, begin "
to see clearly 
why she had to d
"ie, and in what "
way that death w
as but an expres
sion of the inf
inite goodness o
"f the Creator, w"
hose every actio
"n, though
gener"
ally incomprehen
"sible to us, is "
but a manifestat
ion of His infin
ite love for Hi
s creatures. Per
"haps, I often th"
"ink, she was too"
 angelically in
nocent to have t
he strength to p
erform all a mot
her’s duties. 
As a young wife
 she was irrepro
achable; perhaps
 she could not h
ave been so as 
a mother. As it 
"is, not only has"
" she left us, an"
d particularly P
"rince
Andrew, w"
ith the purest r
egrets and memor
"ies, but probabl"
y she will ther
e receive a plac
e I dare not hop
e for myself. Bu
t not to speak o
"f
her alone, th"
at early and ter
rible death has 
had the most ben
eficent influen
ce on me and on 
my brother in sp
ite of all our g
"rief. Then, at
"
the moment of ou
"r loss, these th"
oughts could not
 occur to me; I 
should then hav
e dismissed them
" with horror, bu"
t now they are v
ery clear and c
ertain. I write 
"all this to you,"
" dear friend, on"
ly to convince y
ou of the Gospe
l truth which ha
s become for me 
a principle of l
ife: not a sing
le hair of our h
eads will fall w
ithout His will.
 And His will is
 governed only 
by infinite love
" for us, and so "
whatever befalls
 us is for our 
good.  You ask
 whether we shal
l spend next win
ter in Moscow. I
n spite of my w
"ish to see you, "
I do not think s
o and do not wan
t to do so. You 
will be surpris
ed to hear that 
the reason for t
his is Buonapart
e! The case is 
this: my father�
��s health is gr
owing noticeably
" worse, he canno"
t stand any con
tradiction and i
s becoming irrit
able. This irrit
"ability is, as
"
"you know, chiefl"
y directed to po
litical question
s. He cannot end
ure the notion 
that Buonaparte 
is negotiating o
n equal terms wi
th all the sove
reigns of Europe
 and particularl
"y with our own, "
the grandson of 
the Great Cathe
rine! As you kno
"w, I am quite in"
different to pol
"itics, but
from"
 my father’s r
emarks and his t
alks with Michae
l Ivánovich I k
now all that go
es on in the wor
ld and especiall
y about the hono
rs conferred on
" Buonaparte, who"
 only at Bald Hi
lls in the whole
" world, it seems"
", is
not accept"
ed as a great ma
"n, still less as"
 Emperor of Fran
ce. And my fath
er cannot stand 
this. It seems t
o me that it is 
chiefly because 
of his politica
l views that my 
father is reluct
ant to speak of 
going to Moscow
; for he foresee
s the encounters
 that would resu
lt from his way 
 of expressing h
is views regardl
ess of anybody. 
All the benefit 
he might derive
 from a course o
f treatment he w
ould lose as a r
esult of the di
sputes about Buo
naparte which wo
uld be inevitabl
e. In any case i
t will be decid
ed very shortly.
  Our family l
ife goes on in t
he old way excep
t for my brother
 Andrew’s abs
"ence. He, as I w"
"rote you before,"
 has changed ver
y much of late. 
After his sorro
w he only this y
ear quite recove
red his spirits.
 He has again b
ecome as I used 
to know him when
" a child: kind, "
"affectionate, wi"
th that heart o
f gold to which 
I know no equal.
 He has realized
", it seems to me"
",
that life is "
not over for him
. But together w
ith this mental 
change he has g
rown physically 
much weaker. He 
has become thinn
er and more ner
vous. I am anxio
us about him and
 glad he is taki
ng this trip abr
oad which the d
octors recommend
ed long ago. I h
ope it will cure
 him. You write
 that in Petersb
urg he is spoken
 of as one of th
"e most active,
"
"cultivated, and "
capable of the y
oung men. Forgiv
e my vanity as a
"
relation, but "
I never doubted 
it. The good he 
has done to ever
"ybody
here, fro"
m his peasants u
"p to the gentry,"
 is incalculable
. On his arriva
l in Petersburg 
he received only
 his due. I alwa
ys wonder at the
 way rumors fly
 from Petersburg
" to Moscow, espe"
cially such fals
e ones as that 
you write about�
��I mean the rep
ort of my brothe
r’s betrothal 
to the little R
ostóva. I do no
t think my broth
er will ever mar
"ry again,
and c"
ertainly not her
; and this is wh
"y: first, I know"
 that though he 
 rarely speaks a
bout the wife he
" has lost, the g"
rief of that los
s has gone too 
deep in his hear
t for him ever t
o decide to give
 her a successo
r and our little
 angel a stepmot
her. Secondly be
"cause, as far
a"
"s I know, that g"
irl is not the k
ind of girl who 
could please Pri
nce Andrew. I d
o not think he w
ould choose her 
"for a wife, and "
frankly I do no
t wish it. But I
 am running on t
oo long and am a
t the end of my 
second sheet. G
"ood-by, my dear "
friend. May God 
keep you in His 
holy and mighty 
 care. My dear f
"riend, Mademoise"
"lle Bourienne, s"
ends you kisses.

  CHAPTER XXVI
  In the middl
e of the summer 
Princess Mary re
ceived an unexpe
cted letter fro
m Prince Andrew 
in Switzerland i
n which he gave 
her strange and 
 surprising news
. He informed he
r of his engagem
ent to Natásha 
Rostóva. The w
hole letter brea
thed loving rapt
ure for his betr
othed and tender
 and confiding 
affection for hi
s sister. He wro
te that he had n
ever loved as h
e did now and th
at only now did 
he understand an
d know what life
 was. He asked 
his sister to fo
rgive him for no
t having told he
r of his resolv
e when he had la
st visited Bald 
"Hills, though he"
 had spoken of i
t to his father
. He had not don
e so for fear Pr
incess Mary shou
ld ask her fath
er to give his c
"onsent, irritati"
ng him and havin
g to bear the br
unt of his disp
leasure without 
attaining her ob
ject. “Besides
",” he
wrote, "
“the matter wa
s not then so de
finitely settled
 as it is now. 
My father then i
nsisted on a del
ay of a year and
 now already six
" months,
half o"
"f that period, h"
"ave passed, and "
my resolution is
 firmer than eve
r. If the docto
rs did not keep 
me here at the s
pas I should be 
"back in
Russia,"
 but as it is I 
have to postpone
 my return for t
hree months. You
 know me and my
 relations with 
Father. I want n
othing from him.
 I have been an
d always shall b
e independent; b
ut to go against
 his will and a
"rouse his anger,"
 now that he may
 perhaps remain 
with us such a s
"hort
time, woul"
d destroy half m
y happiness. I a
m now writing to
 him about the 
"same question, a"
nd beg you to ch
oose a good mome
nt to hand him t
he letter and t
o let me know ho
w he looks at th
e whole matter a
nd whether ther
e is hope that h
e may consent to
 reduce the term
 by four months.
”  After lon
"g hesitations, d"
"oubts, and praye"
"rs, Princess Mar"
y gave the lett
er to her father
. The next day t
he old prince sa
id to her quietl
y:  “Write a
nd tell your bro
ther to wait til
l I am dead.... 
It won’t be l
ong—I shall so
on set him free.
”  The princ
ess was about to
" reply, but her "
father would not
 let her speak 
"and, raising his"
 voice more and 
"more, cried:

"
"“Marry, marry,"
 my boy!... A go
od family!... Cl
"ever people, eh?"
" Rich,
eh? Yes,"
 a nice stepmoth
er little Nichol
as will have! Wr
ite and tell him
 that he may ma
rry tomorrow if 
he likes. She wi
ll be little Nic
holas’ stepmo
ther and I’ll 
marry Bourienne!
"... Ha, ha, ha! "
He mustn’t be 
 without a stepm
other either! On
"ly one thing, no"
 more women are 
wanted in my ho
use—let him ma
rry and live by 
himself. Perhaps
 you will go an
d live with him 
too?” he added
", turning to Pri"
ncess Mary. “G
o in heaven’s
 name! Go out in
to the frost... 
the frost... the
 frost!”  Af
ter this outburs
t the prince did
 not speak any m
ore about the ma
tter. But repre
ssed vexation at
 his son’s poo
r-spirited behav
ior found expre
ssion in his tre
atment of his da
ughter. To his f
ormer pretexts 
for irony a fres
h one was now ad
ded—allusions 
to stepmothers a
nd amiabilities
 to Mademoiselle
 Bourienne.  �
��Why shouldn’
t I marry her?�
� he asked his d
aughter. “She�
��ll make a spl
endid princess!�
��  And latter
"ly, to her surpr"
ise and bewilder
"ment, Princess M"
ary noticed tha
t her father was
 really associat
ing more and mor
e with the Fren
chwoman. She wro
te to Prince And
rew about the re
ception of his 
"letter, but comf"
orted him with h
opes of reconcil
ing their father
 to the idea. 
 Little Nichola
s and his educat
"ion, her brother"
" Andrew, and rel"
igion were Prin
cess Mary’s jo
ys and consolati
ons; but besides
" that, since
ev"
eryone must have
" personal hopes,"
 Princess Mary i
n the profoundes
t depths of her
 heart had a hid
den dream and ho
pe that supplied
 the chief cons
olation of her l
ife. This comfor
ting dream and h
ope were given h
er by God’s f
olk—the half-w
itted and other 
pilgrims who vis
ited her withou
t the prince’s
 knowledge. The 
longer she lived
", the more
expe"
rience and obser
vation she had o
"f life, the grea"
ter was her wond
er at the short
-sightedness of 
men who seek enj
oyment and happi
ness here on ea
"rth: toiling, su"
"ffering, struggl"
"ing, and harming"
" one another, to"
 obtain that im
"possible, vision"
"ary, sinful happ"
iness. Prince An
drew had loved 
"his wife, she di"
"ed, but that was"
 not enough: he 
wanted to bind 
his happiness to
 another woman. 
Her father objec
ted to this beca
use he wanted a
 more distinguis
hed and wealthie
r match for Andr
ew. And they al
l struggled and 
suffered and tor
mented one anoth
er and injured t
"heir
souls, the"
ir eternal souls
", for the attain"
ment of benefits
 which endure b
ut for an instan
t. Not only do w
e know this ours
"elves, but Chris"
"t, the
Son of G"
"od, came down to"
 earth and told 
us that this lif
e is but for a 
moment and is a 
probation; yet w
e cling to it an
d think to find 
 happiness in it
. “How is it t
hat no one reali
zes this?” tho
ught Princess M
ary. “No one e
xcept these desp
ised God’s fol
"k who, wallet
o"
"n back, come to "
me by the back d
"oor, afraid of b"
eing seen by the
"
prince, not fo"
r fear of ill-us
age by him but f
or fear of causi
ng him to sin. 
"To leave family,"
" home, and all t"
he cares of worl
"dly welfare, in"
 order without c
linging to anyth
ing to wander in
 hempen rags fro

ut praying for 
all—for those 
who drive one aw

and truth there 
is no life or tr

 was one pilgrim
", a quiet pockma"
rked little woma
n of fifty calle
"d
Theodosia, wh"
o for over thirt
y years had gone
 about barefoot 
and worn heavy 
chains. Princess
 Mary was partic
ularly fond of h
"er. Once, when i"
n a room with a
 lamp dimly lit 
before the icon 
Theodosia was ta
lking of her li
"fe, the thought "
that Theodosia a
lone had found t
he true path of 
 life suddenly c
ame to Princess 
Mary with such f
orce that she re
solved to becom
e a pilgrim hers
elf. When Theodo
sia had gone to 
sleep Princess M
ary thought abo
ut this for a lo
"ng time, and at "
last made up her
" mind that,
str"
ange as it might
" seem, she must "
go on a pilgrima
ge. She disclose
d this thought 
to no one but to
" her confessor, "
"Father Akínfi, "
"the monk,
and h"
e approved of he
r intention. Und
er guise of a pr
esent for the p
"ilgrims, Princes"
s Mary prepared 
a pilgrim’s co
mplete costume f
or herself: a c
"oarse smock, bas"
"t shoes, a rough"
" coat, and a bla"
ck kerchief. Of
"ten, approaching"
 the chest of dr
awers containing
 this secret tre
"asure,
Princess"
" Mary paused, un"
certain whether 
the time had not
 already come to
 put her projec
t into execution
".

Often, list"
ening to the pil
"grims’ tales, "
she was so stimu
lated by their 
"simple speech, m"
echanical to the
m but to her so 
full of deep me

ral times she wa
s on the point o

   BOOK SEVEN
: 1810 - 11   
    CHAPTER I
  The Bible le
gend tells us th
at the absence o
f labor—idlene
ss—was a cond
ition of the fir
st man’s bless
edness before th
e Fall. Fallen m
an has retained
 a love of idlen
"ess, but the cur"
se weighs on the
 race not only 
because we have 
to seek our brea
d in the sweat o
"f our brows, but"
 because our mo
ral nature is su
ch that we canno
t be both idle a
nd at ease. An 
inner voice tell
s us we are in t
he wrong if we a
re idle. If man 
 could find a st
ate in which he 
felt that though
 idle he was ful
filling his dut
"y, he would have"
 found one of th
e conditions of 
man’s primitiv
e blessedness. 
And such a state
 of obligatory a
nd irreproachabl
e idleness is t
he lot of a whol
e class—the mi
litary. The chie
f attraction of 
 military servic
e has consisted 
and will consist
 in this compuls
ory and irrepro
achable idleness
.  Nicholas Ro
stóv experience
d this blissful 
condition to the
" full when,
aft"
"er 1807, he cont"
inued to serve i
n the Pávlograd
" regiment, in wh"
ich he already 
commanded the sq
uadron he had ta
ken over from De
nísov.  Rost�
�v had become a 
"bluff, good-natu"
"red fellow, whom"
 his Moscow acq
uaintances would
 have considered
 rather bad form
", but who was li"
ked and respect
ed by his comrad
"es, subordinates"
", and superiors,"
 and was well c
ontented with hi
"s life. Of late,"
" in 1809, he fou"
nd in letters fr
om home more fr
equent complaint
s from his mothe
r that their aff
airs were fallin
g into greater 
and greater diso
"rder, and that i"
t was time for h
im to come back
 to gladden and 
comfort his old 
parents.  Read
ing these letter
"s, Nicholas felt"
 a dread of thei
r wanting to ta
ke him away from
 surroundings in
" which, protecte"
d from all the 
entanglements of
" life, he was li"
ving so calmly a
nd quietly. He f
elt that sooner
 or later he wou
ld have to re-en
ter that whirlpo
"ol of life, with"
 its embarrassm
ents and affairs
 to be straighte
"ned out, its acc"
ounts with stew
"ards, quarrels, "
"and intrigues, i"
"ts ties, society"
", and with
Són"
ya’s love and 
his promise to h
er. It was all d
readfully diffic
ult and complic
ated; and he rep
lied to his moth
"er in cold, form"
al letters in F
"rench, beginning"
: “My dear Mam
"ma,” and endin"
g: “Your obedi
"ent
son,” whi"
ch said nothing 
of when he would
 return. In 1810
 he received le
tters from his p
"arents, in which"
 they told him o
f Natásha’s 
engagement to Bo
"lkónski, and th"
at the wedding w
ould be in a yea
r’s time beca
use the old prin
ce made difficul
ties. This lette
r grieved and m
ortified Nichola
s. In the first 
place he was sor
ry that Natásha
", for
whom he c"
ared more than f
or anyone else i
"n the family, sh"
ould be lost to 
 the home; and s
"econdly, from hi"
s hussar point o
"f view, he regre"
tted not to hav
e been there to 
show that fellow
 Bolkónski that
 connection with
 him was no suc
h great honor af
"ter all, and tha"
t if he loved Na
tásha he might
 dispense with p
ermission from h
is dotard father
. For a moment h
e hesitated whe
ther he should n
ot apply for lea
ve in order to s
ee Natásha bef
ore she was marr
"ied, but then ca"
me the maneuvers
", and considerat"
ions about Són
ya and about the
 confusion of th
"eir affairs, and"
 Nicholas again
 put it off. But
 in the spring o
"f that year, he "
received a lette
r from his moth
"er, written with"
out his father�
"�s knowledge, an"
d that letter p
ersuaded him to 
return. She wrot
e that if he did
 not come and t
ake matters in h
"and, their whole"
 property would 
be sold by aucti
on and they wou
ld all have to g
o begging. The c
ount was so weak
", and trusted
M"
"ítenka so much,"
 and was so good
"-natured, that e"
verybody took ad
vantage of him 
and things were

  This letter t
ouched Nicholas.
 He had that com
mon sense of a 
matter-of-fact m
an which showed 
him what he ough
t to do.  The 
right thing now 
"was, if not to r"
etire from the s
"ervice, at any r"
ate to go home 
on leave. Why he
 had to go he di
d not know; but 
after his after
-dinner nap he g
ave orders to sa
"ddle Mars, an ex"
tremely vicious 
 gray stallion t
hat had not been
 ridden for a lo
"ng time, and whe"
n he returned w
ith the horse al
"l in a lather, h"
e informed Lavr�
�shka (Denísov
’s servant who
 had remained wi
th him) and his 
comrades who tu
rned up in the e
vening that he w
as applying for 
leave and was go
ing home. Diffi
cult and strange
 as it was for h
im to reflect th
at he would go 
away without hav
ing heard from t
he staff—and t
his interested h
im extremely—
whether he was p
romoted to a cap
taincy or would 
receive the Ord
er of St. Anne f
or the last mane
uvers; strange a
s it was to thin
k that he would
 go away without
 having sold his
 three roans to 
the Polish Coun
"t Golukhovski, w"
ho was bargainin
g for the horses
 Rostóv had bet
ted he would se
ll for two thous
and rubles; inco
mprehensible as 
it seemed that 
the ball the hus
sars were giving
 in honor of the
 Polish Mademoi
selle Przazdziec
ka (out of rival
ry to the Uhlans
 who had given 
one in honor of 
their Polish Mad
emoiselle Borzoz
owska) would tak
e place without
 him—he knew h
e must go away f
"rom this good, b"
right world to 
somewhere where 
everything was s
tupid and confus
ed. A week later
 he obtained hi
s leave. His hus
sar comrades—n
ot only those of
 his own regime
"nt, but the whol"
e brigade—gave
 Rostóv a dinne
r to which the 
subscription was
 fifteen rubles 
"a head, and at w"
hich there were 
two bands and t
wo choirs of sin
gers. Rostóv da
nced the Trepák
 with Major Bá
sov; the tipsy o
"fficers tossed, "
"embraced, and dr"
opped Rostóv; t
he soldiers of 
the third squadr
on tossed him to
"o, and shouted �"
��hurrah!” an
d then they put 
him in his sleig
h and escorted h
im as far as the
 first post sta
tion.  During 
the first half o
f the journey—
from Kremenchúg
 to Kiev—all 
Rostóv’s thou
"ghts, as is usua"
"l in such cases,"
 were behind him
", with
the squa"
dron; but when h
e had gone more 
than halfway he 
began to forget 
 his three roans
 and Dozhoyvéyk
"o, his quarterma"
"ster, and to won"
der anxiously h
ow things would 
be at Otrádnoe 
and what he woul
d find there. T
houghts of home 
grew stronger th
e nearer he appr
oached it—far 
"
stronger, as th"
ough this feelin
g of his was sub
ject to the law 
by which the fo
rce of attractio
n is in inverse 
proportion to th
e square of the 
 distance. At th
e last post stat
ion before Otrá
dnoe he gave the
 driver a three
"-ruble tip, and "
on arriving he r
"an breathlessly,"
" like a boy, up "
the steps of hi
s home.  After
 the rapture of 
"meeting, and aft"
er that odd feel
ing of unsatisfi
ed expectation�
��the feeling th
at “everything
 is just the sam
"e, so why
did I"
 hurry?”—Nic
holas began to s
ettle down in hi
s old home world
. His father an
d mother were mu
"ch the same, onl"
y a little older
. What was new 
in them was a ce
rtain uneasiness
 and occasional 
"discord, which t"
here used not t
"o be, and which,"
 as Nicholas soo
"n found out, was"
 due to the bad
 state of their 
affairs. Sónya 
was nearly twent
y; she had stopp
ed growing pret
tier and promise
d nothing more t
han she was alre
"ady, but
that w"
as enough. She e
xhaled happiness
 and love from t
he time Nicholas
"
returned, and "
"the faithful, un"
alterable love o
f this girl had 
a gladdening ef
fect on him. Pé
tya and Natásha
 surprised Nicho
las most. Péty
a was a big hand
some boy of thir
"teen, merry, wit"
"ty, and
mischie"
"vous, with a voi"
ce that was alre
ady breaking. As
" for Natásha,
"
for a long while
 Nicholas wonder
ed and laughed w
henever he looke
d at her.  �
�You’re not th
"e same at all,�"
� he said.  �
�How? Am I uglie
r?”  “On t
"he contrary, but"
 what dignity? A
 princess!” he
 whispered to h
"er.

“Yes, y"
"es, yes!” crie"
"d Natásha, joyf"
ully.  She tol
d him about her 
romance with Pri
nce Andrew and o
f his visit to 
Otrádnoe and sh
owed him his las
t letter.  “
"Well, are you gl"
ad?” Natásha 
asked. “I am s
o tranquil and h
appy now.”  
"
“Very glad,�"
� answered Nicho
las. “He is an
 excellent fello
w.... And are y
ou very much in 
love?”  “H
ow shall I put i
t?” replied Na
tásha. “I was
 in love with B
"orís, with my t"
"eacher, and with"
" Denísov, but t"
his is quite dif
ferent. I feel 
at peace and set
tled. I know tha
t no better man 
"than he exists,"
 and I am calm a
nd contented now
. Not at all as 
before.”  Ni
cholas expressed
 his disapproval
 of the postpone
ment of the marr
iage for a year
; but Natásha a
ttacked her brot
her with exasper
"ation, proving
"
to him that it c
ould not be othe
"rwise, and that "
it would be a ba
d thing to ente
r a family again
st the father’
"s will, and that"
 she herself wi
shed it so.  �
��You don’t at
" all understand,"
” she said.  
 Nicholas was si
lent and agreed 
with her.  Her
 brother often w
ondered as he lo
oked at her. She
 did not seem at
 all like a gir
l in love and pa
rted from her af
fianced husband.
 She was even-t
empered and calm
 and quite as ch
eerful as of old
. This amazed N
icholas and even
 made him regard
 Bolkónski’s 
courtship skepti
cally. He could
 not believe tha
t her fate was s
"ealed, especiall"
y as he had not
 seen her with P
rince Andrew. It
 always seemed t
o him that there
 was something 
not quite right 
about this inten
ded marriage.  
 “Why this del
ay? Why no betro
thal?” he thou
"ght. Once, when "
he had touched 
on this topic wi
"th his mother, h"
"e discovered, to"
 his surprise a
nd somewhat to h
"is satisfaction,"
 that in the dep
th of her soul s
he too had doub
ts about this ma
rriage.  “Yo
"u see he writes,"
"” said she, sh"
owing her son a 
letter of Prince
"
Andrew’s, wi"
th that latent g
rudge a mother a
lways has in reg
ard to a daught
er’s future ma
"rried happiness,"
 “he writes th
at he won’t co
me before Decem
ber. What can be
 keeping him? Il
"lness, probably!"
 His health is 
very delicate. D
on’t tell Nat�
�sha. And don’
t attach importa
nce to her bein
g so bright: tha
t’s because sh
e’s living thr
ough the last d
ays of her girlh
"ood, but I know "
what she is like
 every time we r
eceive a letter
 from him! Howev
"er, God grant th"
at everything tu
rns out well!”
 (She always en
ded with these w
ords.) “He is 
an excellent man
!”      
CHAPTER II  Af
ter reaching hom
e Nicholas was a
t first serious 
and even dull. H
e was worried b
y the impending 
necessity of int
erfering in the 
stupid business 
 matters for whi
ch his mother ha
d called him hom
e. To throw off 
this burden as 
quickly as possi
"ble, on the thir"
d day after his 
arrival he went
", angry and scow"
ling and without
 answering quest
ions as to where
" he
was going, "
to Mítenka’s 
lodge and demand
ed an account of
 everything. Bu
t what an accoun
t of everything 
might be Nichola
s knew even less
 than the frigh
tened and bewild
ered Mítenka. T
he conversation 
and the examina
tion of the acco
unts with Míten
ka did not last 
long. The villag
"e
elder, a peas"
"ant delegate, an"
d the village cl
"erk, who were wa"
iting in the pa
"ssage, heard wit"
h fear and delig
ht first the you
ng count’s voi
ce roaring and 
snapping and ris
ing louder and l
"ouder, and then "
"words of
abuse,"
" dreadful words,"
 ejaculated one 
after the other.
  “Robber!..
. Ungrateful wre
tch!... I’ll h
ack the dog to p
ieces! I’m no
t my father!... 
Robbing us!...�
� and so on.  
Then with no les
s fear and delig
ht they saw how 
"the young count,"
 red in the fac
e and with blood
"shot eyes, dragg"
ed Mítenka out 
by the scruff of
 the neck and a
pplied his foot 
and knee to his 
behind with grea
t agility at co
nvenient moments
 between the wor
"ds, shouting, �"
�Be off! Never l
et me see your 
"face here again,"
 you villain!”
  Mítenka fle
w headlong down 
the six steps an
d ran away into 
the shrubbery. 
(This shrubbery 
was a well-known
 haven of refuge
 for culprits a
t Otrádnoe. Mí
"tenka himself, r"
eturning tipsy f
"rom the town, us"
ed to hide ther
"e, and many of t"
he residents at 
"Otrádnoe, hidin"
g from Mítenka
", knew of its pr"
otective qualiti
es.)  Mítenka
’s wife and si
sters-in-law thr
ust their heads 
and frightened 
faces out of the
 door of a room 
where a bright s
amovar was boili
ng and where th
e steward’s hi
gh bedstead stoo
d with its patch
work quilt.  T
he young count p
aid no heed to t
"hem, but, breath"
"ing hard, passed"
 by with resolu
te strides and w
ent into the hou
se.  The count
"ess, who heard a"
t once from the 
maids what had h
appened at the 
"lodge, was calme"
d by the thought
 that now their 
affairs would ce
rtainly improve
", but on the oth"
er hand felt anx
ious as to the e
ffect this exci
tement might hav
e on her son. Sh
e went several t
imes to his door
 on tiptoe and 
"listened, as he "
lighted one pipe
 after another. 
  Next day the 
old count called
 his son aside a
"nd, with an emba"
"rrassed
smile, "
said to him:  
"“But you know,"
" my dear boy, it"
’s a pity you 
got excited! Mí
tenka has told 
me all about it.
”  “I knew
",” thought Nic"
"holas, “that I"
 should never un
derstand anythi
ng in this crazy
 world.”  �
�You were angry 
that he had not 
entered those 70
0 rubles. But th
ey were carried
 forward—and y
ou did not look 
at the other pag
e.”  “Papa
", he is a blackg"
uard and a thief
! I know he is! 
And what I have 
"
done, I have do"
"ne; but, if you "
"like, I won’t "
speak to him aga
"in.”

“No,"
 my dear boy” 
"(the count, too,"
 felt embarrasse
d. He knew he ha
d mismanaged hi
s wife’s prope
rty and was to b
lame toward his 
"children,
but h"
e did not know h
ow to remedy it)
". “No, I beg y"
ou to attend to 
the business. I
 am old. I...”
"

“No, Papa."
 Forgive me if I
 have caused you
 unpleasantness.
 I understand i
t all less than 
you do.”  �
�Devil take all 
"these peasants, "
and money matter
"s, and carryings"
 forward from p
"age to page,” "
he thought. “I
 used to underst
and what a ‘c
orner’ and the
 stakes at cards
" meant, but carr"
ying forward to 
 another page I 
don’t understa
"nd at all,” sa"
id he to himself
", and
after tha"
t he did not med
dle in business 
affairs. But onc
e the countess 
called her son a
nd informed him 
that she had a p
romissory note f
rom Anna Mikhá
ylovna for two t
"housand rubles, "
and asked him wh
at he thought of
 doing with it.
"

“This,” "
answered Nichola
s. “You say it
 rests with me. 
"Well, I
don’t"
 like Anna Mikh�
�ylovna and I do
n’t like Borí
"s, but they were"
 our friends an
d poor. Well the
"n, this!” and "
he tore up the n
"ote, and
by so "
doing caused the
 old countess to
 weep tears of j
"oy. After that,"
 young Rostóv t
ook no further p
art in any busin
"ess affairs, but"
 devoted himsel
f with passionat
e enthusiasm to 
what was to him 
a new pursuit�
�the chase—for
 which his fathe
r kept a large e
stablishment.  
     CHAPTER
 III  The weat
her was already 
growing wintry a
nd morning frost
s congealed an 
earth saturated 
by autumn rains.
 The verdure had
 thickened and i
ts bright green
 stood out sharp
ly against the b
rownish strips o
f winter rye tr
odden down by th
"e cattle, and ag"
ainst the pale-y
ellow stubble of
 the spring buc
kwheat. The wood
ed ravines and t
"he copses, which"
 at the end of 
August had still
 been green isla
nds amid black f
ields and stubbl
"e, had
become g"
olden and bright
-red islands ami
d the green wint
er rye. The har
es had already h
alf changed thei
"r summer coats, "
the fox cubs wer
e beginning to 
"scatter, and the"
 young wolves we
re bigger than d
ogs. It was the
 best time of th
e year for the c
hase. The hounds
 of that ardent 
young sportsman
 Rostóv had not
 merely reached 
hard winter cond
"ition, but were"
 so jaded that a
t a meeting of t
he huntsmen it w
as decided to gi
ve them a three
 days’ rest an
"d then, on the s"
ixteenth of Sept
"ember, to go on"
 a distant exped
"ition, starting "
from the oak gro
ve where there w
as an undisturb
ed litter of wol
f cubs.  All t
hat day the houn
ds remained at h
ome. It was fros
ty and the air w
"as
sharp, but t"
oward evening th
e sky became ove
rcast and it beg
an to thaw. On 
"the fifteenth, w"
hen young Rostó
"v, in his dressi"
"ng gown, looked "
out of the wind
"ow, he saw it wa"
s an unsurpassab
le morning for h
unting: it was 
as if the sky we
re melting and s
inking to the ea
rth without any 
 wind. The only 
motion in the ai
r was that of th
"e dripping, micr"
oscopic particl
es of drizzling 
mist. The bare t
wigs in the gard
en were hung wit
h transparent d
rops which fell 
on the freshly f
allen leaves. Th
e earth in the 
kitchen garden l
ooked wet and bl
ack and glistene
d like poppy see
d and at a shor
t distance merge
"d into the dull,"
 moist veil of m
ist. Nicholas w
ent out into the
 wet and muddy p
orch. There was 
a smell of deca
ying leaves and 
"of dog. Mílka, "
"a black-spotted,"
 broad-haunched 
 bitch with prom
inent black eyes
", got up on seei"
"ng her master, s"
tretched her hi
"nd legs, lay dow"
"n like a hare, a"
nd then suddenly
 jumped up and 
licked him right
 on his nose and
 mustache. Anoth
"er borzoi, a dog"
",
catching sigh"
t of his master 
from the garden 
"path, arched his"
" back
and, rush"
ing headlong tow
ard the porch wi
"th lifted tail, "
began rubbing h
imself against h
is legs.  “O
-hoy!” came at
" that moment, th"
at inimitable hu
ntsman’s call 
 which unites th
e deepest bass w
ith the shrilles
"t tenor, and rou"
nd the corner c
ame Daniel the h
ead huntsman and
" head kennelman,"
" a gray,
wrinkl"
ed old man with 
hair cut straigh
t over his foreh
"ead, Ukrainian
"
"fashion, a long "
bent whip in his
" hand, and that "
look of independ
ence and scorn 
of everything th
at is only seen 
in huntsmen. He 
doffed his Circ
assian cap to hi
s master and loo
ked at him scorn
fully. This scor
n was not offen
sive to his mast
er. Nicholas kne
w that this Dani
"el,
disdainful "
of everybody and
 who considered 
himself above th
"em, was all
the"
 same his serf a
nd huntsman.  
“Daniel!” Ni
cholas said timi
"dly, conscious a"
t the sight of t
"he
weather, the"
" hounds, and the"
 huntsman that h
e was being carr
ied away by tha
t irresistible p
assion for sport
 which makes a m
an forget all h
is previous reso
"lutions, as a lo"
ver forgets in t
he presence of h
is mistress.  
"
“What orders,"
 your excellency
?” said the hu
ntsman in his de
"ep bass,
deep a"
s a proto-deacon
’s and hoarse 
with hallooing�
�and two flashin
g black eyes ga
zed from under h
is brows at his 
"master, who was "
silent. “Can 
you resist it?�
� those eyes see
med to be asking
.  “It’s a
" good day, eh? F"
or a hunt and a 
"gallop, eh?” a"
"sked
Nicholas, "
scratching Mílk
a behind the ear
s.  Daniel did
" not answer, but"
 winked instead.
  “I sent Uv
árka at dawn to
" listen,” his "
bass boomed out 
after a minute�
��s pause. “He
 says she’s mo
ved them into th
e Otrádnoe enc
losure. They wer
e howling there.
” (This meant 
that the she-wol
"f,
about whom t"
"hey both knew, h"
ad moved with he
r cubs to the Ot
"rádnoe
copse, "
a small place a 
mile and a half 
from the house.)
  “We ought 
"to go, don’t y"
ou think so?” 
said Nicholas. �
��Come to me wi
th Uvárka.” 
 “As you plea
se.”  “The
n put off feedin
g them.”  �
"�Yes, sir.”
"
 Five minutes la
ter Daniel and U
várka were stan
ding in Nicholas
’ big study. 
Though Daniel wa
"s not a big man,"
 to see him in a
 room was like 
seeing a horse o
r a bear on the 
floor among the 
furniture and s
urroundings of h
uman life. Danie
l himself felt t
"his, and as usua"
l stood just in
"side the door, t"
rying to speak s
oftly and not mo
"ve, for fear of"
 breaking someth
ing in the maste
"r’s apartment,"
 and he hastened
 to say all tha
t was necessary 
so as to get fro
m under that cei
"ling, out into
"
the open under t
he sky once more
.  Having fini
shed his inquiri
es and extorted 
from Daniel an o
pinion that the
 hounds were fit
 (Daniel himself
 wished to go hu
"nting), Nicholas"
 ordered the ho
rses to be saddl
ed. But just as 
Daniel was about
 to go Natásha
 came in with ra
"pid steps, not h"
aving done up he
r hair or finis
hed dressing and
 with her old nu
rse’s big shaw
l wrapped round 
 her. Pétya ran
 in at the same 
time.  “You 
are going?” as
ked Natásha. �
�I knew you woul
d! Sónya said 
you wouldn’t g
"o, but I knew th"
at today is the 
sort of day when
 you couldn’t
 help going.” 
"

“Yes, we ar"
"e going,” repl"
ied Nicholas rel
"uctantly, for to"
"day, as he
inte"
nded to hunt ser
"iously, he did n"
ot want to take 
Natásha and Pé
tya. “We are 
"going, but only "
wolf hunting: it
 would be dull f
or you.”  �
�You know it is 
my greatest plea
"sure,” said Na"
tásha. “It’
s not fair; you
 are going by yo
"urself, are havi"
ng the horses sa
ddled and said 
nothing to us ab
out it.”  �
�‘No barrier b
ars a Russian’
s path’—we�
�ll go!” shout
ed Pétya.  �
��But you can’
t. Mamma said yo
"u mustn’t,” "
said Nicholas to
 Natásha.  �
"��Yes, I’ll go"
. I shall certai
"nly go,” said "
Natásha decisiv
"ely.
“Daniel,"
 tell them to sa
"ddle for us, and"
 Michael must co
me with my dogs
",” she added t"
o the huntsman. 
  It seemed to 
Daniel irksome a
nd improper to b
e in a room at a
"ll, but to
have"
 anything to do 
with a young lad
y seemed to him 
impossible. He 
cast down his ey
es and hurried o
ut as if it were
 none of his bus
"iness,
careful "
as he went not t
o inflict any ac
cidental injury 
on the young la
dy.      C
HAPTER IV  The
" old count, who "
had always kept 
up an enormous h
unting establish
ment but had no
w handed it all 
completely over 
to his son’s c
"are, being
in v"
ery good spirits
 on this fifteen
"th of September,"
 prepared to go 
out with the ot
hers.  In an h
our’s time the
 whole hunting p
arty was at the 
"porch. Nicholas,"
 with a stern a
nd serious air w
hich showed that
 now was no time
 for attending 
"to trifles, went"
 past Natásha a
nd Pétya who we
re trying to te
ll him something
. He had a look 
at all the detai
"ls of the hunt, "
sent a pack of 
hounds and hunts
men on ahead to 
"find the quarry,"
 mounted his ch
"estnut Donéts, "
and whistling to
 his own leash o
"f borzois, set o"
ff across the t
hreshing ground 
to a field leadi
ng to the Otrád
noe wood. The o
ld count’s hor
"se, a sorrel gel"
ding called Vifl
"yánka, was led "
by the groom in
 attendance on h
"im, while the co"
unt himself was 
to drive in a s
mall trap straig
ht to a spot res
erved for him. 
 They were taki
ng fifty-four ho
"unds, with six h"
unt attendants a
nd whippers-in.
 Besides the fam
"ily, there were "
eight borzoi ken
nelmen and more
 than forty borz
"ois, so that, wi"
th the borzois o
n the leash bel
onging to member
"s of the family,"
 there were abou
t a hundred and 
 thirty dogs and
 twenty horsemen
.  Each dog kn
ew its master an
d its call. Each
 man in the hunt
 knew his busin
"ess, his place, "
what he had to d
o. As soon as th
ey had passed th
e fence they al
l spread out eve
"nly and quietly,"
 without noise o
"r talk,
along t"
he road and fiel
d leading to the
 Otrádnoe cover
t.  The horses
 stepped over th
e field as over 
"a thick carpet, "
now and then sp
lashing into pud
dles as they cro
ssed a road. The
 misty sky still

When they had go

ve more riders w

"�Good morning, U"

�Uncle.” (He 
was a distant re

That’s where I

 Nicholas.  T
he hounds were j

" Pétya, who was"

"

“Nicholas,"
 what a fine dog
 Truníla is! He

 “In the first

"Nicholas, and lo"

��Uncle’s” r
emark by this ca
ll to his borzoi
. Karáy was a 
shaggy old dog w
ith a hanging jo
"wl, famous for h"
aving tackled a
 big wolf unaide
d. They all took
 up their places
.  The old cou
"nt, knowing his "
son’s ardor in
" the hunt, hurri"
ed so as not to
" be late, and th"
e huntsmen had n
ot yet reached t
heir places when
 Count Ilyá Ro
"stóv, cheerful,"
" flushed, and wi"
th quivering che
"eks, drove up
w"
ith his black ho
rses over the wi
nter rye to the 
place reserved f
"or him,
where a"
 wolf might come
 out. Having str
aightened his co
at and fastened 
 on his hunting 
"knives and horn,"
 he mounted his 
"good, sleek, wel"
"l-fed,
and comf"
"ortable horse, V"
"iflyánka, which"
 was turning gra
"y, like himself."
 His horses and
 trap were sent 
home. Count Ily�
"� Rostóv, thoug"
h not at heart 
a keen sportsman
", knew the rules"
 of the hunt wel
"l, and rode to
"
the bushy edge o
f the road where

", arranged his r"
"eins,
settled h"
imself in the sa

ng that he was r
"eady, looked
ab"
out with a smile
.  Beside him 
was Simon Chekm�
"�r, his personal"
" attendant, an o"
ld horseman now
 somewhat stiff 
in the saddle. C
hekmár held in 
leash three for
midable wolfhoun
"ds, who had, how"
"ever, grown fat "
like their maste

. Two wise old d

"tood Mítka, the"
 count’s other

"hunt, by
old cu"
"stom, the count "
had drunk a silv
er cupful of mul
"led brandy, take"
"n
a snack, and "
washed it down w
ith half a bottl
e of his favorit
e Bordeaux.  H
e was somewhat f
lushed with the 
wine and the dri

e rather moist 
and glittered mo
"re than usual, a"
nd as he sat in 
"his saddle,
wra"
pped up in his f

having got every

t glancing at h
is master with w
hom he had lived
 on the best of 
terms for thirt

erstanding the m

pected a pleasan

 person rode up 
circumspectly th
rough the wood (
it was plain th
at he had had a 
lesson) and stop
ped behind the c
ount. This pers
on was a gray-be
arded old man in
 a woman’s clo
"ak, with a tall"
 peaked cap on h
is head. He was 
"the buffoon, who"
 went by a woman

"

“Well, Nas"

l’ll give it y

 the count and t

“Have you seen

 “Of course!

“Yes, sir. He"

��  “A perfe

he chased a fox 
out of the rank

 “To search fa

" the count, evid"
ently sorry Simo
n had not said 
more. “To sear
"ch far,” he sa"
"id, turning back"
 the skirt of hi

  “The other

��They are on th

The count, fo"

" on his face, lo"
oked into the d
istance straight
" before him, dow"
n the narrow ope
"n space, holding"
 the snuffbox i
n his hand but n
ot taking any. A
fter the cry of 
the hounds came
 the deep tones 
of the wolf call
 from Daniel’s
 hunting horn; t
he pack joined 
the first three 
hounds and they 
could be heard i
"n full cry,
wit"
h that peculiar 
lift in the note
 that indicates 
that they are af
ter a wolf. The
 whippers-in no 
longer set on th
"e hounds, but ch"
anged to the cr
"y of ulyulyu, an"
d above the othe
rs rose Daniel�
"�s voice, now a "
"deep
bass, now "
piercingly shril
l. His voice see
med to fill the 
whole wood and 
carried far beyo
nd out into the 
open field.  A
fter listening a
 few moments in 
"silence, the cou"
nt and his atten
dant convinced 
themselves that 
the hounds had s
eparated into tw
o packs: the so
und of the large
"r pack, eagerly "
"giving tongue, b"
egan to die away
 in the distanc
"e, the other pac"
k rushed by the 
wood past the co
"unt, and
it was"
 with this that 
Daniel’s voice
 was heard calli
ng ulyulyu. The
 sounds of both 
packs mingled an
d broke apart ag
"ain, but both we"
re becoming mor
e distant.  Si
mon sighed and s
tooped to straig
hten the leash a
 young borzoi ha
d entangled; th
e count too sigh
"ed and, noticing"
 the snuffbox in
" his hand,
open"
ed it and took a
 pinch. “Back!
” cried Simon 
to a borzoi that
 was pushing fo
rward out of the
 wood. The count
 started and dro
pped the snuffb
ox. Nastásya Iv
ánovna dismount
ed to pick it up
. The count and 
 Simon were look
ing at him.  T
"hen, unexpectedl"
"y, as often happ"
"ens, the sound o"
f the hunt sudde
"nly
approached,"
 as if the hound
s in full cry an
d Daniel ulyulyu
ing were just i
n front of them.
  The count tu
rned and saw on 
his right Mítka
 staring at him 
with eyes start
ing out of his h
"ead, raising his"
 cap and pointin
g before him to 
the other side.
  “Look out!
"” he shouted, "
in a voice plain
ly showing that 
he had long fre
tted to utter th
"at word, and let"
ting the borzois
 slip he gallope
d toward the co
unt.  The coun
t and Simon gall
oped out of the 
wood and saw on 
their left a wo
"lf which, softly"
 swaying from si
"de to side, was "
coming at a quie
t lope farther 
to the left to t
he very place wh
ere they were st
anding. The ang
ry borzois whine
d and getting fr
ee of the leash 
rushed past the 
 horses’ feet 
at the wolf.  
"The wolf paused,"
 turned its heav
y forehead towar
d the dogs awkwa
"rdly,
like a ma"
n suffering from
" the quinsy, and"
", still slightly"
 swaying from s
"ide to side, gav"
e a couple of le
aps and with a s
wish of its tail
 disappeared in
to the skirt of 
the wood. At the
" same instant, w"
ith a cry like 
"a wail, first on"
"e hound, then an"
"other, and then "
"another, sprang"
 helter-skelter 
from the wood op
posite and the w
hole pack rushed
 across the fie
ld toward the ve
ry spot where th
e wolf had disap
peared. The haze
l bushes parted
 behind the houn
ds and Daniel’
s chestnut horse
" appeared,
dark"
 with sweat. On 
its long back sa
"t Daniel, hunche"

"ss,
his disheve"
led gray hair ha

"lushed, perspiri"
ng face.  “U

ed. When he caug
ht sight of the 
 count his eyes 
flashed lightnin
g.  “Blast y
ou!” he shoute
"d, holding up hi"
s whip threateni
ngly at the cou
nt.  “You’
ve let the wolf 
go!... What spor
tsmen!” and as
 if scorning to 
 say more to the
 frightened and 
shamefaced count
", he lashed the "
heaving flanks 
of his sweating 
chestnut gelding
 with all the an
ger the count h
ad aroused and f
lew off after th
e hounds. The co
"unt, like a puni"
"shed
schoolboy,"
" looked round, t"
rying by a smile
 to win Simon’
s sympathy for 
his plight. But 
Simon was no lon
ger there. He wa
s galloping roun
d by the bushes
 while the field
 was coming up o
"n both sides, al"
l trying to head
"
the wolf, but "
it vanished into
 the wood before
 they could do s
o.      CH
APTER V  Nicho
las Rostóv mean
while remained a
"t his post, wait"
ing for the wolf
. By the way th
e hunt approache
"d and receded, b"
y the cries of t
he dogs whose n
otes were famili
"ar to him, by th"
e way the voices
 of the huntsmen
"
approached, re"
"ceded, and rose,"
 he realized wha
t was happening 
at the copse. H
e knew that youn
g and old wolves
" were there, tha"
t the hounds had
 separated into
" two packs, that"
 somewhere a wol
f was being chas
"ed, and
that so"
mething had gone
 wrong. He expec
ted the wolf to 
come his way any
 moment. He mad
e thousands of d
ifferent conject
ures as to where
 and from what 
side the beast w
ould come and ho
w he would set u
pon it. Hope al
ternated with de
spair. Several t
imes he addresse
d a prayer to Go
d that the wolf
 should come his
 way. He prayed 
with that passio
nate and shamef
aced feeling wit
h which men pray
 at moments of g
reat excitement 
 arising from tr
ivial causes. �
�What would it b
e to Thee to do 
this for me?”
 he said to God.
 “I know Thou 
"art great, and t"
hat it is a sin 
to ask this of 
"Thee, but for Go"
d’s sake do le
t the old wolf c
ome my way and 
let Karáy sprin
g at it—in sig
ht of ‘Uncle�
� who is watchin
g from over the
re—and seize i
t by the throat 
in a death grip!
” A thousand 
times during tha
t half-hour Rost
óv cast eager a
nd restless gla
nces over the ed
"ge of the wood, "
with the two scr
aggy oaks rising
 above the aspe
n undergrowth an
d the gully with
 its water-worn 
side and “Unc
le’s” cap ju
st visible above
 the bush on his
 right.  “No
", I shan’t hav"
"e such luck,” "
"thought Rostóv,"
 “yet what wo
uldn’t it be w
orth! It is not 
to be! Everywher
"e, at cards and "
"in
war, I am al"
ways unlucky.”
 Memories of Aus
terlitz and of D
ólokhov flashe
d rapidly and cl
early through hi
s mind. “Only 
once in my life 
 to get an old w
"olf, I want only"
 that!” though
"t he, straining "
eyes and ears a
nd looking to th
e left and then 
to the right and
 listening to th
e slightest var
iation of note i
n the cries of t
he dogs.  Agai
n he looked to t
he right and saw
 something runni
ng toward him ac
ross the desert
"ed field. “No,"
 it can’t be!�
�� thought Rost�
"�v, taking a
de"
"ep breath, as a "
man does at the 
coming of someth
ing long hoped f
or. The height 
of happiness was
 reached—and s
"o simply, withou"
"t warning, or
n"
"oise, or display"
", that Rostóv c"
ould not believe
 his eyes and re
mained in doubt
 for over a seco
nd. The wolf ran
 forward and jum
ped heavily over
 a gully that l
ay in her path. 
She was an old a
nimal with a gra
y back and big 
reddish belly. S
he ran without h
"urry, evidently "
feeling sure tha
t no one saw he
"r. Rostóv, hold"
"ing his breath, "
looked round at 
the borzois. Th
ey stood or lay 
not seeing the w
olf or understan
ding the situati
on. Old Karáy 
had turned his h
ead and was angr
ily searching fo
"r fleas,
baring"
 his yellow teet
h and snapping a
t his hind legs.
  “Ulyulyuly
u!” whispered 
"Rostóv, pouting"
 his lips. The b
orzois jumped u
"p, jerking the r"
ings of the leas
hes and pricking
 their ears. Ka
ráy finished sc
ratching his hin
"dquarters and, c"
"ocking his ears,"
 got up with qu
ivering tail fro
m which tufts of
 matted hair hun
g down.  “Sh
all I loose them
 or not?” Nich
olas asked himse
lf as the wolf 
approached him c
oming from the c
opse. Suddenly t
he wolf’s whol
e physiognomy c
hanged: she shud
"dered, seeing wh"
at she had proba
bly never seen 
before—human e
yes fixed upon h
er—and turning
 her head a litt
le toward Rost�
"�v, she paused."
  “Back or fo
"rward? Eh, no ma"
"tter, forward..."
” the wolf see
med to say to h
"erself, and she "
moved forward wi
thout again look
ing round and wi
"th a
quiet, lon"
"g, easy yet reso"
lute lope.  �
�Ulyulyu!” cri
"ed Nicholas, in "
a voice not his 
"own, and of its "
own accord his 
good horse darte
d headlong downh
"ill, leaping ove"
r gullies to he
"ad off the wolf,"
 and the borzois
" passed it, runn"
ing faster still
. Nicholas did 
not hear his own
 cry nor feel th
at he was gallop
"ing, nor
see th"
"e borzois, nor t"
he ground over w
hich he went: he
 saw only the w
"olf, who, increa"
"sing her speed, "
bounded on in th
e same direction
 along the holl
ow. The first to
 come into view 
"was Mílka, with"
 her black mark
ings and powerfu
"l quarters, gain"
ing upon the wol
f. Nearer and n
earer... now she
 was ahead of it
; but the wolf t
urned its head t
"o face
her, and"
 instead of putt
ing on speed as 
she usually did 
Mílka suddenly 
 raised her tail
 and stiffened h
er forelegs.  
“Ulyulyulyulyu
!” shouted Nic
holas.  The re
ddish Lyubím ru
shed forward fro
"m behind Mílka,"
 sprang impetuo
usly at the wolf
", and seized it "
by its hindquart
"ers, but
immedi"
ately jumped asi
de in terror. Th
"e wolf crouched,"
 gnashed her te
"eth, and again r"
ose and bounded 
"forward, followe"
d at the distanc
e of a couple o
f feet by all th
"e borzois, who d"
id not get any c
loser to her.  
 “She’ll get
" away! No, it’"
s impossible!”
 thought Nichola
"s, still
shouti"
ng with a hoarse
 voice.  “Ka
"ráy, ulyulyu!.."
".” he shouted,"
 looking round f
or the old borzo
i who was now h
is only hope. Ka
"ráy, with all t"
he strength age 
"had left
him, s"
tretched himself
 to the utmost a
"nd, watching the"
" wolf, galloped"
 heavily aside t
o intercept it. 
But the quicknes
s of the wolf’
s lope and the 
borzoi’s slowe
r pace made it p
lain that Karáy
 had miscalcula
ted. Nicholas co
uld already see 
not far in front
 of him the woo
d where the wolf
 would certainly
 escape should s
he reach it. But
",
coming toward"
" him, he saw hou"
nds and a huntsm
an galloping alm
ost straight at
 the wolf. There
 was still hope.
" A long, yellowi"
sh young borzoi
", one Nicholas d"
"id not know, fro"
"m another leash,"
 rushed impetuo
usly at the wolf
 from in front a
nd almost knocke
d her over. But 
 the wolf jumped
 up more quickly
 than anyone cou
ld have expected
" and,
gnashing "
"her teeth, flew "
at the yellowish
" borzoi, which, "
with a piercing 
"
yelp, fell with"
 its head on the
" ground, bleedin"
g from a gash in
 its side.  �
��Karáy? Old fe
llow!...” wail
ed Nicholas.  
Thanks to the de
lay caused by th
is crossing of t
he wolf’s path
", the
old dog w"
ith its felted h
air hanging from
 its thigh was w
ithin five pace
s of it. As if a
ware of her dang
"er, the wolf tur"
ned her eyes on 
"
Karáy, tucked "
her tail yet fur
ther between her
" legs, and incre"
ased her speed.
 But here Nichol
as only saw that
 something happe
ned to Karáy�
�the borzoi was 
suddenly on the 
"wolf, and they r"
olled together 
down into a gull
y just in front 
of them.  That
" instant, when N"
icholas saw the 
wolf struggling 
in the gully wi
"th the dogs, whi"
le from under th
em could be seen
 her gray hair a
nd outstretched
 hind leg and he
r frightened cho

her ears laid b

pinning her by t

the happiest mo

. With his hand 
on his saddlebow
", he was ready t"
o dismount and 
"stab the wolf, w"
hen she suddenly
 thrust her head
 up from among 
that mass of dog
"s, and then her "
forepaws were on
 the edge of the
 gully. She cli
cked her teeth (
Karáy no longer
 had her by the 
"throat),
leaped"
 with a movement
 of her hind leg
s out of the gul
"ly, and having
"
disengaged herse

t forward. Kar�
"�y, his hair bri"
"stling, and prob"
ably bruised or

God! Why?” Nic
holas cried in d
espair.  “Un

 wolf’s path 
and his borzois 
once more stoppe
d the animal’s
 advance. She w
as again hemmed 
in.  Nicholas 
and his attendan
"t, with “Uncle"
” and his hunt
"sman, were all
"
riding round the
" wolf, crying �"
�ulyulyu!” sho
uting and prepar
ing to dismount
 each moment tha
t the wolf crouc
"hed back, and st"
arting forward 
again every time
 she shook herse
lf and moved tow
ard the wood whe
re she would be
 safe.  Alread
"y, at the beginn"
ing of this chas
"e, Daniel, heari"
ng the ulyulyuin
"g,
had rushed o"
ut from the wood
. He saw Karáy 
"seize the wolf, "
and checked his
" horse, supposin"
g the affair to 
be over. But whe
n he saw that th
e horsemen did 
not dismount and
 that the wolf s
hook herself and
 ran for safety
", Daniel set his"
 chestnut gallop
"ing, not at the "
wolf but straigh
t toward the wo
"od, just as Kar�"
�y had run to cu
t the animal off
. As a result o
"f this, he gallo"
ped up to the wo
lf just when she
 had been stopp
ed a second time
 by “Uncle’s
” borzois.  
Daniel galloped 
"up silently, hol"
ding a naked dag
ger in his left 
hand and thrash
ing the laboring
 sides of his ch
estnut horse wit
h his whip as if
 it were a flai
l.  Nicholas n
either saw nor h
eard Daniel unti
"l the chestnut, "
breathing heavi
"ly, panted past "
"him, and he hear"
d the fall of a 
body and saw Dan
iel lying on th
e wolf’s back 
"among the dogs, "
trying to seize 
her by the ears
. It was evident
" to the dogs, th"
"e hunters, and t"
o the wolf herse
lf that all was
 now over. The t
errified wolf pr
essed back her e
ars and tried t
"o rise, but the "
borzois stuck to
 her. Daniel ros
"e a little, took"
"
a step, and wi"
th his whole wei
"ght, as if lying"
" down to rest, f"
ell on the wolf
", seizing her by"
 the ears. Nicho
las was about to
" stab her, but
"
Daniel whispered
", “Don’t! We"
’ll gag her!�
"� and, changing "
"his
position, s"
et his foot on t
he wolf’s neck
. A stick was th
rust between he
r jaws and she w
as fastened with
" a leash, as if "
"bridled, her leg"
s were bound to
"gether, and Dani"
el rolled her ov
er once or twice
 from side to s
ide.  With hap
"py, exhausted fa"
"ces, they laid t"
"he old wolf, ali"
"ve, on a shying"
 and snorting ho
"rse and, accompa"
nied by the dogs
" yelping at her,"
 took her to th
e place where th
ey were all to m
eet. The hounds 
had killed two o
f the cubs and 
the borzois thre
e. The huntsmen 
assembled with t
heir booty and 
"their stories, a"
nd all came to l
"ook at the wolf,"
" which, with her"
 broad-browed h
ead hanging down
 and the bitten 
stick between he
"r jaws,
gazed w"
ith great glassy
 eyes at this cr
owd of dogs and 
men surrounding 
 her. When she w
"as touched, she "
jerked her bound
 legs and looked
 wildly yet sim
ply at everybody
. Old Count Rost
óv also rode up
 and touched the
 wolf.  “Oh
", what a formida"
ble one!” said
 he. “A formid
"able one, eh?”"
 he asked Danie
"l, who was stand"
ing near.  “
"Yes, your excell"
"ency,” answere"
"d Daniel, quickl"
y doffing his ca
p.  The count 
remembered the w
olf he had let s
lip and his enco
unter with Dani
"el.

“Ah, bu"
t you are a crus
"ty fellow, frien"
d!” said the c
ount.  For sol
e reply Daniel g
"ave him a shy, c"
"hildlike, meek, "
and amiable smi
le.      C
HAPTER VI  The
 old count went 
"home, and Natás"
ha and Pétya pr
omised to return
" very
soon, but"
 as it was still
 early the hunt 
went farther. At
 midday they pu
t the hounds int
o a ravine thick
ly overgrown wit
h young trees. 
Nicholas standin
g in a fallow fi
eld could see al
l his whips.  
Facing him lay a
 field of winter
" rye, there his "
own huntsman sto
od alone in a h
ollow behind a h
azel bush. The h
ounds had scarce
ly been loosed 
before Nicholas 
heard one he kne
"w, Voltórn, giv"
ing tongue at in
tervals; other 
hounds joined in
", now pausing an"
d now again givi
ng tongue. A mo
ment later he he
ard a cry from t
he wooded ravine
 that a fox had 
"been
found, and"
" the whole pack,"
 joining togethe
"r, rushed along "
the ravine towa
rd the ryefield 
and away from Ni
cholas.  He sa
w the whips in t
heir red caps ga
lloping along th
e edge of the r
"avine, he even s"
"aw the hounds, a"
nd was expecting
 a fox to show i
tself at any mo
ment on the ryef
ield opposite. 
 The huntsman s
tanding in the h
ollow moved and 
loosed his borzo
"is, and
Nichola"
"s saw a queer, s"
hort-legged red 
fox with a fine 
brush going hard
 across the fie
ld. The borzois 
bore down on it.
... Now they dre
w close to the 
fox which began 
to dodge between
 the field in sh
arper and sharpe
"r
curves, trail"
"ing its brush, w"
hen suddenly a s
trange white bor
zoi dashed in f
ollowed by a bla
"ck one, and ever"
ything was in co
nfusion; the bor
zois formed a s
tar-shaped figur
"e, scarcely sway"
ing their bodies
 and with tails
 turned away fro
m the center of 
the group. Two h
untsmen galloped
 up to the dogs
; one in a red c
"ap, the other, a"
" stranger, in a "
green coat.  �
��What’s this?
” thought Nich
olas. “Where�
�s that huntsman
 from? He is no
t ‘Uncle’s�
� man.”  The
 huntsmen got th
"e fox, but staye"
d there a long t
ime without stra
pping it to the
 saddle. Their h
"orses, bridled a"
nd with high sad
"dles, stood
nea"
r them and there
 too the dogs we
re lying. The hu
ntsmen waved the
ir arms and did
 something to th
e fox. Then from
 that spot came 
the sound of a 
"horn, with the s"
ignal agreed on 
in case of a fig
ht.  “That�
�s Ilágin’s h
untsman having a
 row with our Iv
"án,” said
Ni"
cholas’ groom.
  Nicholas sen
t the man to cal
l Natásha and P
"étya to him, an"
d rode at a foo
tpace to the pla
ce where the whi
ps were getting 
the hounds toget
her. Several of
 the field gallo
ped to the spot 
where the fight 
was going on.  
 Nicholas dismou
"nted, and with N"
atásha and Pét
"ya, who had ridd"
"en up,
stopped "
"near the hounds,"
 waiting to see 
how the matter w
ould end. Out of
 the bushes cam
e the huntsman w
ho had been figh
ting and rode to
ward his young 
"master, with the"
 fox tied to his
 crupper. While 
still at a dist
ance he took off
 his cap and tri
ed to speak resp
"ectfully, but he"
 was pale and b
reathless and hi
s face was angry
. One of his eye
"s was black,
bu"
t he probably wa
s not even aware
 of it.  “Wh
at has happened?
” asked Nichol
as.  “A like
"ly thing, killin"
g a fox our dogs
 had hunted! And
 it was my gray 
 bitch that caug
ht it! Go to law
", indeed!... He "
snatches at the 
fox! I gave him
 one with the fo
x. Here it is on
 my saddle! Do y
ou want a taste 
 of this?...” 
said the huntsma
"n, pointing to h"
is dagger and pr
obably imaginin
g himself still 
speaking to his 
foe.  Nicholas
", not stopping t"
o talk to the ma
"n, asked his sis"
ter and Pétya 
to wait for him 
and rode to the 
spot where the e
"nemy’s, Ilági"
"n’s,
hunting "
party was.  Th
e victorious hun
tsman rode off t
o join the field
", and there,
su"
rrounded by inqu
iring sympathize
"rs, recounted hi"
s exploits.  T
he facts were th
"at Ilágin, with"
 whom the Rostó
vs had a quarrel
 and were at la
"w, hunted over p"
laces that belon
ged by custom to
" the Rostóvs,
"
"and had now, as "
"if purposely, se"
nt his men to th
e very woods the
 Rostóvs were 
hunting and let 
his man snatch a
 fox their dogs 
had chased.  
"Nicholas, though"
 he had never se
"en Ilágin, with"
 his usual absen
ce of moderatio
"n in judgment, h"
ated him cordial
ly from reports 
of his arbitrar
iness and violen
"ce, and regarded"
 him as his bitt
erest foe. He r
ode in angry agi
tation toward hi
"m, firmly graspi"
ng his whip and 
fully prepared 
to take the most
 resolute and de
sperate steps to
 punish his ene
my.  Hardly ha
d he passed an a
ngle of the wood
 before a stout 
gentleman in a 
beaver cap came 
riding toward hi
m on a handsome 
raven-black hors
"e,
accompanied "
by two hunt serv
ants.  Instead
" of an enemy, Ni"
cholas found in 
Ilágin a statel
y and courteous 
 gentleman who w
as particularly 
anxious to make 
the young count�
��s acquaintanc
e. Having ridden
" up to Nicholas,"
 Ilágin raised 
his beaver cap 
and said he much
 regretted what 
had occurred and
 would have the 
 man punished wh
o had allowed hi
mself to seize a
 fox hunted by s
omeone else’s
 borzois. He hop
ed to become bet
ter acquainted w
ith the count a
nd invited him t
o draw his cover
"t.

Natásha, "
afraid that her 
brother would do
 something dread
"ful, had
follow"
ed him in some e
xcitement. Seein
g the enemies ex
changing friendl
"y
greetings, sh"
e rode up to the
m. Ilágin lifte
d his beaver cap
 still higher t
o Natásha and s
"aid, with a plea"
"sant smile, that"
 the young coun
tess resembled D
iana in her pass
ion for the chas
e as well as in 
"her
beauty, of "
which he had hea
rd much.  To e
xpiate his hunts
"man’s offense,"
 Ilágin pressed
 the Rostóvs to
 come to an upl
and of his about
 a mile away whi
ch he usually ke
pt for himself 
"and which, he sa"
"id, swarmed with"
 hares. Nicholas
" agreed, and the"
"
hunt, now doub"
"led, moved on.
"
 The way to Ili
gin’s upland w
as across the fi
elds. The hunt s
ervants fell in
to line. The mas
ters rode togeth
"er. “Uncle,”"
" Rostóv, and
I"
lágin kept stea
lthily glancing 
at one another�
"�s dogs, trying "
not to be obser
ved by their com
panions and sear
ching uneasily f
or rivals to th
eir own borzois.
  Rostóv was 
particularly str
uck by the beaut
"y of a small, pu"
"re-bred,
red-sp"
otted bitch on I
lágin’s leash
", slender but wi"
th muscles like 
"
steel, a delica"
"te muzzle, and p"
rominent black e
yes. He had hear
d of the swiftn
ess of Ilágin�
"�s borzois, and "
in that beautifu
l bitch saw a r
ival to his own 
Mílka.  In th
e middle of a so
ber conversation
 begun by Ilági
n about the yea
"r’s harvest, N"
icholas pointed 
to the red-spott
ed bitch.  “
A fine little bi
"tch, that!” sa"
id he in a carel
ess tone. “Is 
she swift?” 
 “That one? Y
"es, she’s a go"
"od dog, gets wha"
"t she’s after,"
” answered Il
ágin indifferen
"tly, of the red-"
spotted bitch Er
"zá, for
which,"
" a year before, "
he had given a n
eighbor three fa
milies of house 
 serfs. “So in
" your parts, too"
", the harvest is"
 nothing to boas
"t of,
Count?”"
" he went on, con"
tinuing the conv
ersation they ha
d begun. And co
nsidering it pol
ite to return th
e young count’
"s compliment, Il"
ágin looked at
 his borzois and
 picked out Míl
ka who attracted
 his attention 
by her breadth. 
“That black-sp
otted one of you
rs is fine—wel
l shaped!” sa
id he.  “Yes
", she’s fast e"
"nough,” replie"
"d Nicholas, and "
thought: “If 
only a full-grow
n hare would cro
ss the field now
 I’d show you 
what sort of bo
"rzoi she is,” "
and turning to h
"is groom, he sai"
d he would give
 a ruble to anyo
ne who found a h
are.  “I don
"’t understand,"
” continued Il
"ágin, “how so"
me sportsmen can
 be so jealous 
about game and d
"ogs. For myself,"
" I can tell you,"
" Count,
I enjoy"
 riding in compa
ny such as this.
.. what could be
 better?” (he 
 again raised hi
s cap to Natásh
a) “but as for
 counting skins 
and what one ta
"kes, I don’t c"
are about that.�
��  “Of cour
se not!”  �
�Or being upset 
because someone

 All I care abou

"is it not so,
C"
ount? For I cons
ider that...” 
  “A-tu!” c
ame the long-dra
wn cry of one of
 the borzoi whip
"pers-in,
who ha"
d halted. He sto
od on a knoll in
" the stubble, ho"
lding his whip 
"aloft, and again"
 repeated his lo
"ng-drawn cry, �"
�A-tu!” (This 
call and the up
lifted whip mean
t that he saw a 
sitting hare.) 
"
“Ah, he has "
"found one, I thi"
"nk,” said Ilá"
gin carelessly. 
"“Yes, we
must"
 ride up.... Sha
ll we both cours
e it?” answere
"d Nicholas, seei"
ng in Erzá and
 “Uncle’s”
 red Rugáy two 
rivals he had ne
ver yet had a c
hance of pitting
 against his own
 borzois. “And
 suppose they ou
tdo my Mílka a
t once!” he th
ought as he rode
 with “Uncle�
� and Ilágin t
oward the hare. 
  “A full-gro
wn one?” asked
 Ilágin as he a
pproached the wh
ip who had sigh
ted the hare—a
nd not without a
gitation he look
ed round and wh
istled to Erzá.
"

“And you, "
Michael Nikanór
ovich?” he sai
"d, addressing �"
�Uncle.”  Th
e latter was rid
ing with a sulle
n expression on 
his face.  “
How can I join i
"n? Why, you’ve"
 given a village
 for each of you
r borzois! That
"’s it, come on"
! Yours are wort
h thousands. Try
 yours against 
"one another, you"
" two, and I’ll"
 look on!”  
"“Rugáy, hey, "
hey!” he shout
ed. “Rugáyush
"ka!” he added,"
 involuntarily 
by this diminuti
ve expressing hi
s affection and 
the hopes he pl
aced on this red
 borzoi. Natásh
a saw and felt t
he agitation the
 two elderly me
n and her brothe
r were trying to
" conceal, and wa"
s herself excit
ed by it.  The
 huntsman stood 
halfway up the k
noll holding up 
his whip and the
 gentlefolk rod
e up to him at a
 footpace; the h
ounds that were 
far off on the 
horizon turned a
way from the har
"e, and the whips"
", but not the
g"
"entlefolk, also "
moved away. All 
were moving slow
ly and sedately.
  “How is it
 pointing?” as
"ked Nicholas, ri"
ding a hundred p
aces toward the
 whip who had si
ghted the hare. 
  But before th
e whip could rep
"ly, the hare, sc"
enting the frost
 coming next mo
"rning, was unabl"
e to rest and le
aped up. The pac
k on leash rushe
d downhill in f
ull cry after th
"e hare, and from"
 all sides the b
orzois that wer
e not on leash d
arted after the 
hounds and the h
are. All the hun
"t,
who had been"
" moving slowly, "
"shouted, “Stop"
!” calling in 
"the hounds,
whi"
le the borzoi wh
"ips, with a cry "
of “A-tu!” g
alloped across t
he field settin
g the borzois on
 the hare. The t
"ranquil Ilágin,"
" Nicholas,
Nat�"
"�sha, and “Unc"
"le” flew, reck"
less of where an
"d how they went,"
 seeing only th
e borzois and th
e hare and feari
ng only to lose 
sight even for 
an instant of th
e chase. The har
e they had start
ed was a strong 
and swift one. 
When he jumped u
p he did not run
" at once, but pr"
icked his ears 
listening to the
 shouting and tr
ampling that res
ounded from all 
 sides at once. 
He took a dozen 
"bounds, not very"
" quickly, lettin"
g the borzois g
"ain on him, and,"
 finally having 
chosen his direc

"��Miláshka, dea"

 as if Mílka w

 Again the beaut

“Erzá, da"

rye and the stub

it was e"
asier for the ha

 A moment later

"“Rugáy, here�"

“And if you pu

 that will be be

ee it’s damp w
"eather, and you"
"
could rest, and"
 the little coun
tess could be dr
iven home in a t
rap.”  “Un
cle’s” offer
 was accepted. A
 huntsman was se
nt to Otrádnoe 
"for
a trap, whi"
le Nicholas rode
 with Natásha a
nd Pétya to “
Uncle’s” ho
use.  Some fiv
e male domestic 
"serfs, big and l"
"ittle, rushed ou"
t to the front 
porch to meet th
eir master. A sc
ore of women ser
"fs, old and youn"
"g, as
well as c"
"hildren, popped "
out from the bac
k entrance to ha
ve a look at th
e hunters who we
re arriving. The
 presence of Nat
"ásha—a woman,"
" a
lady, and on"
 horseback—rai
sed the curiosit
y of the serfs t
o such a degree
 that many of th
em came up to he
"r, stared her in"
" the face, and
"
unabashed by her
 presence made r
emarks about her
 as though she w
ere some prodig
y on show and no
t a human being 
able to hear or 
understand what 
 was said about 
her.  “Arín
"ka! Look, she si"
ts sideways! The
re she sits and 
her skirt dangl
"es.... See, she�"
��s got a little
 hunting horn!�
�  “Goodness
 gracious! See h

  “Isn’t sh

 “How is it y

�� asked the bol

��Uncle” dismo
unted at the por
ch of his little
 wooden house wh
ich stood in th
e midst of an ov
ergrown garden a
"nd, after a glan"
ce at his retai
"ners, shouted au"
thoritatively th
at the superfluo
us ones should t
ake themselves 
off and that all
 necessary prepa
rations should b
e made to recei
ve the guests an
d the visitors. 
  The serfs all
 dispersed. “U
ncle” lifted N
atásha off her 
horse and takin
g her hand led h
er up the ricket
y wooden steps o
f the porch. The
"
house, with it"
"s bare, unplaste"
"red log walls, w"
as not overclean
—it did not s
eem that those l
iving in it aime
d at keeping it 
spotless—but 
neither was it n
oticeably neglec
ted. In the entr
y there was a sm
ell of fresh ap
"ples, and wolf a"
nd fox skins hun
g about.  “U
ncle” led the 
visitors through
 the anteroom in
to a small hall 
with a folding 
table and red ch
"airs, then into "
the drawing room
 with a round b
irchwood table a
"nd a sofa, and f"
inally into his 
private room whe
re there was a 
"tattered sofa, a"
" worn carpet, an"
d portraits of S
"uvórov, of
the"
 host’s father
" and mother, and"
 of himself in m
ilitary uniform.
 The study smel
t strongly of to
bacco and dogs. 
“Uncle” aske
d his visitors 
to sit down and 
make themselves 
"at home, and the"
n went out of th
"e room.
Rugáy,"
 his back still 
"muddy, came into"
 the room and la
y down on the s
"ofa, cleaning hi"
mself with his t
ongue and teeth.
 Leading from th
e study was a p
assage in which 
a partition with
 ragged curtains
 could be seen.
 From behind thi
s came women’s
 laughter and wh
ispers. Natásha
",
Nicholas, and"
 Pétya took off
 their wraps and
 sat down on the
" sofa.
Pétya, "
leaning on his e
"lbow, fell aslee"
p at once. Natá
sha and Nicholas
 were silent. T
heir faces glowe
"d, they were hun"
gry and very che
erful. They loo
ked at one anoth
er (now that the
 hunt was over a
nd they were in 
"
the house, Nich"
olas no longer c
onsidered it nec
essary to show h
is manly superi
ority over his s
"ister), Natásha"
 gave him a wink
", and neither
r"
efrained long fr
om bursting into
 a peal of ringi
ng laughter even
 before they ha
d a pretext read
y to account for
 it.  After a 
while “Uncle�
"� came in, in a "
"Cossack coat, bl"
"ue trousers, and"
 small top boot
s. And Natásha 
felt that this c
"ostume, the very"
 one she had re
garded with surp
rise and amuseme
"nt at Otrádnoe,"
 was just the r
ight thing and n
ot at all worse 
than a swallow-t
ail or frock coa
t. “Uncle” 
too was in high 
spirits and far 
from being offen
ded by the brot
her’s and sist
er’s laughter 
(it could never 
enter his head t
hat they might 
be laughing at h
is way of life) 
he himself joine
d in the merrim
ent.  “That�
"��s right, young"
" countess, that�"
"��s it, come on!"
 I never saw an
yone like her!�
"� said he, offer"
ing Nicholas a p
ipe with a long 
"stem
and, with "
a practiced moti
on of three fing
"ers, taking down"
 another that h
ad been cut shor
t. “She’s ri
dden all day lik
"e a man, and is "
as fresh as eve
r!”  Soon af
ter “Uncle’s
” reappearance
 the door was op
"ened, evidently"
 from the sound 
by a barefooted 
"girl, and a stou"
"t, rosy, good-lo"
oking woman of 
"about forty, wit"
h a double chin 
and full red lip
"s, entered
carr"
ying a large loa
ded tray. With h
ospitable dignit
y and cordiality
 in her glance 
and in every mot
"ion, she looked "
at the visitors 
"and, with
a ple"
"asant smile, bow"
ed respectfully.
 In spite of her
 exceptional st
"outness, which c"
aused her to pro
trude her chest 
and stomach and 
throw back her 
"head, this woman"
 (who was “Unc
le’s” housek
eeper) trod ver
y lightly. She w
ent to the table
", set down the t"
"ray, and with he"
r plump white h
ands deftly took
 from it the bot
tles and various
 hors d’oeuvr
es and dishes an
d arranged them 
on the table. Wh
en she had fini
"shed, she steppe"
d aside and stop
ped at the door 
with a smile on 
her face. “He
re I am. I am sh
e! Now do you un
derstand ‘Uncl
e’?” her ex
pression said to
 Rostóv. How co
uld one help und
erstanding? Not 
"only
Nicholas, "
but even Natásh
a understood the
 meaning of his 
puckered brow a
nd the happy com
placent smile th
at slightly puck
ered his lips wh
en Anísya Fëd
orovna entered. 
On the tray was 
a bottle of herb
" wine,
differen"
t kinds of vodka
", pickled mushro"
"oms, rye cakes m"
ade with butter
"milk, honey in t"
"he comb, still m"
ead and sparklin
"g mead, apples,"
 nuts (raw and r
"oasted), and nut"
-and-honey sweet
s. Afterwards sh
e brought a fre
shly roasted chi
"cken, ham, prese"
rves made with h
"oney, and preser"
ves made with s
ugar.  All thi
s was the fruit 
of Anísya Fëdo
rovna’s housek
"eeping, gathered"
 and prepared b
y her. The smell
 and taste of it
 all had a smack
 of Anísya Fë
dorovna herself:
 a savor of juic
"iness, cleanline"
"ss,
whiteness, "
and pleasant smi
les.  “Take 
"this, little Lad"
y-Countess!” s
"he kept saying, "
as she offered 
Natásha first o
ne thing and the
n another.  Na
tásha ate of ev
erything and tho
ught she had nev
er seen or eaten
 such buttermil
"k cakes, such ar"
"omatic jam, such"
 honey-and-nut s
"weets, or such
"
a chicken anywhe
re. Anísya Fëd
orovna left the 
room.  After s
"upper, over thei"
"r cherry brandy,"
 Rostóv and “
Uncle” talked 
 of past and fut
"ure hunts, of Ru"
gáy and Ilágin
"’s dogs, while"
 Natásha sat u
pright on the so
fa and listened 
with sparkling e
yes. She tried 
several times to
 wake Pétya tha
t he might eat s
"omething, but he"
 only muttered 
incoherent words
 without waking 
up. Natásha fel
t so lightheart
ed and happy in 
these novel surr
oundings that sh
e only feared t
he trap would co
me for her too s
oon. After a cas
"ual pause, such "
as often occurs
 when receiving 
friends for the 
first time in on
e’s own house
", “Uncle,” a"
nswering a thoug
ht that was in h
is visitors’ 
"minds, said:

"
"“This, you see"
", is how I am fi"
nishing my days.
.. Death will co
me. That’s it
", come on! Nothi"
ng will remain. 
Then why harm an
yone?”  “U
ncle’s” face
 was very signif
icant and even h
andsome as he sa
id this. Involu
ntarily Rostóv 
recalled all the
 good he had hea
rd about him fr
om his father an
d the neighbors.
 Throughout the 
whole province 
“Uncle” had 
the reputation o
f being the most
 honorable and 
disinterested of
 cranks. They ca
lled him in to d
ecide family dis
"putes,
chose hi"
"m as executor, c"
onfided secrets 
"to him, elected "
him to be a jus
tice and to othe

always persisten
tly refused publ
ic appointments
", passing the au"
tumn and spring 
in the fields on
 his bay geldin
"g, sitting at ho"

d lying in his o
vergrown garden 
in summer.  �
��Why don’t yo

"
"
“I did once,"
 but gave it up.
 I am not fit fo
r it. That’s i
"t, come
on! I c"
an’t make head
 or tail of it. 
That’s for you
—I haven’t 
brains enough. N
"ow, hunting is a"
nother matter—
"that’s it, com"
e on! Open the 
"door, there!” "
he shouted. “W
hy have you shut
 it?”  The d
oor at the end o
f the passage le
d to the huntsme
"n’s room, as t"
hey called the 
room for the hun
t servants.  T
here was a rapid
 patter of bare 
"feet, and an uns"
een hand opened 
the door into t
he huntsmen’s 
"room, from which"
 came the clear 
sounds of a bal
aláyka on which
" someone, who wa"
s evidently a ma
"ster of the art,"
 was playing. N
atásha had been
 listening to th
ose strains for 
some time and n
ow went out into
 the passage to 
hear better.  
“That’s Mít
"ka, my coachman."
... I have got h
im a good balal�
�yka. I’m fon
"d of it,” said"
 “Uncle.”  
 It was the cust
om for Mítka to
 play the balal�
�yka in the hunt
smen’s room w
hen “Uncle” 
returned from th
e chase. “Uncl
e” was fond of
 such music.  
 “How good! Re
ally very good!�
�� said Nicholas
 with some unint
entional superc
"iliousness, as i"
f ashamed to con
fess that the so
unds pleased him
 very much.  
“Very good?”
 said Natásha r
"eproachfully, no"
ticing her broth
er’s tone. �
�Not ‘very goo

ply delicious!�
�  Just as “
Uncle’s” pic
"kled mushrooms, "
"honey, and cherr"
y brandy had se
emed to her the 
best in the worl
"d, so also that "
"song, at that mo"
"ment,
seemed to"
 her the acme of
 musical delight
".

“More, pl"
"ease, more!” c"
ried Natásha at
 the door as soo
n as the balal�
�yka ceased. Mí
tka tuned up afr
"esh, and recomme"

the balaláyka t
o the air of My 
"Lady, with trill"

. “Uncle” s
"at listening, sl"
"ightly smiling, "
with his head on
 one side. The 
air was repeated
 a hundred times
. The balaláyka
 was retuned sev
eral times and 
the same notes w
ere thrummed aga
"in, but the list"
eners did not g
row weary of it 
and wished to he
ar it again and 
again. Anísya 
Fëdorovna came 
in and leaned he
r portly person 
against the door
post.  “You 
like listening?�
�� she said to N
"atásha, with a "
smile extremely 
 like “Uncle�
�s.” “That�
�s a good player
" of ours,” she"
 added.  “He
 doesn’t play 
that part right!
” said “Uncl
"e” suddenly, w"
ith an energeti
c gesture. “He
re he ought to b
urst out—that�
"��s it, come

�Do you play the

“Anísya, "
go and see if th
e strings of my 
guitar are all r
ight. I haven�
�t touched it fo

 Anísya Fëdoro
"vna, with her li"
"ght step, willin"
gly went to fulf
ill her errand 
and brought back
 the guitar.  
Without looking 
"at anyone, “Un"
cle” blew the 
"dust off it and,"
 tapping the ca
se with his bony
" fingers, tuned "
the guitar and s
ettled himself i
n his armchair.
 He took the gui
tar a little abo
ve the fingerboa
"rd, arching
his"
 left elbow with
 a somewhat thea
"trical gesture, "
"and, with a wink"
 at Anísya Fë
"dorovna, struck "
"a single chord, "
pure and sonorou
"s, and then
qui"
"etly, smoothly, "
and confidently 
began playing in
" very slow time,"
" not
My Lady, b"
ut the well-know

ecision and in e

 to thrill in th
e hearts of Nic
holas and Natás
"ha, arousing in "
them the same ki
nd of sober mir
th as radiated f
rom Anísya Fëd
orovna’s whole
 being. Anísya 
 Fëdorovna flus
"hed, and drawing"
 her kerchief ov
er her face went
 laughing out o
f the room. “U

d to play correc
"tly, carefully,"
 with energetic 
"firmness, lookin"
g with a changed
 and inspired ex
pression at the
 spot where Aní
sya Fëdorovna h
ad just stood. S
omething seemed 
to be laughing 
a little on one 
side of his face
 under his gray 
"mustaches,

cially as the so
ng grew brisker 
and the time qui
"cker and when, h"
"ere

as he ran his fi

“Lovely,"
" lovely! Go on, "
"Uncle, go on!”"
 shouted Natásh
a as soon as he
 had finished. S
he jumped up and
 hugged and kiss

 and then he sto
pped short and j
erked his should
ers.  “Go on
", Uncle dear,”"
 Natásha wailed
 in an imploring
 tone as if her 
 life depended o
n it.  “Uncl
"e” rose, and i"
t was as if ther

the merry fellow
 struck a naïv

" exclaimed, wavi"
ng to Natásha t
he hand that ha
d just struck a

ha threw off the
 shawl from her 
"shoulders, ran f"
orward to face 
"“Uncle,” and"
 setting her arm
s akimbo also ma
de a motion with
 her shoulders 
and struck an at
titude.  Where

supposed, "
long ago have ef
faced? But the s
pirit and the mo
vements were th
ose inimitable a
nd unteachable R
ussian ones that
 “Uncle” had
 expected of he
r. As soon as sh
e had struck her
" pose, and smile"
"d
triumphantly,"
" proudly, and wi"
th sly merriment
", the fear that "
had at first se
ized Nicholas an

 already admirin

id the right thi

"plete precision,"
 that Anísya F

ad at once hande

", had tears in h"
"er eyes, though "
she laughed as s
he watched this
" slim, graceful "
"countess, reared"
 in silks and ve

fferent from her

s able to unders
tand all that wa

“Well, li"

"��Uncle,”
wit"
h a joyous laugh
", having finishe"

"Well done, niece"
! Now a fine yo

 “Oh?” said
 “Uncle” in

nodded her head 
with a happy smi
le.  “And su
ch a one!” she
 said. But as so
on as she had sa
id it a new tra
in of thoughts a
nd feelings aros
e in her. “Wha
t did Nicholas�

en he said ‘ch
osen already’?
 Is he glad of i
t or not? It is
 as if he though
t my Bolkónski 
would not approv

nd our gaiety. 
But he would und
erstand it all. 
Where is he now?
” she thought
", and her face s"
uddenly became s
erious. But this
 lasted only a 
second. “Don�
�t dare to think
" about it,” sh"
e said to hersel
"f,
and sat down"
 again smilingly
 beside “Uncle
",” begging him"
 to play someth
ing more.  “
Uncle” played 
another song and
 a valse; then a
fter a pause he 
 cleared his thr
oat and sang his
 favorite huntin
g song:      A
s ‘twas growin
g dark last nigh
t     Fell the 
snow so soft and
 light...  “
Uncle” sang as
" peasants sing, "
with full and na
ïve conviction 
that the whole 
meaning of a son
g lies in the wo
rds and that the
 tune comes of 
"itself, and that"
 apart from the 
words there is n
"o tune, which ex"
ists only to gi
ve measure to th
e words. As a re
sult of this the
 unconsidered t
"une, like the so"
"ng of a bird, wa"
s extraordinaril
y good. Natásha
 was in ecstasi
es over “Uncle
’s” singing.
 She resolved to
 give up learnin
g the harp and 
to play only the
 guitar. She ask
ed “Uncle” f
or his guitar a
nd at once found
 the chords of t
he song.  Afte
r nine o’clock
 two traps and t
hree mounted men
", who had been s"
ent to look for
" them, arrived t"
o fetch Natásha
 and Pétya. The
 count and coun
tess did not kno
w where they wer
e and were very 
"anxious, said on"
e of the men. 
 Pétya was car
ried out like a 
log and laid in 
the larger of th
e two traps. Na
tásha and Nicho
las got into the
 other. “Uncle
” wrapped Nat
ásha up warmly 
and took leave o
f her with quite
 a new tendernes
s. He accompani
ed them on foot 
as far as the br
idge that could 
"not be crossed,"
 so that they ha
d to go round by
" the ford, and h"
e sent huntsmen 
to ride in fron
t with lanterns.
"

“Good-by, "
"dear niece,” h"
is voice called 
out of the darkn
ess—not the v
oice Natásha ha
d known previous
"ly, but the one "
that had sung As
 ‘twas growin
g dark last nigh
t.  In the vil
lage through whi
ch they passed t
here were red li
ghts and a chee
rful smell of sm
oke.  “What 
a darling Uncle 
is!” said Nat�
"�sha, when they "
had come out on
to the highroad.
"

“Yes,” r"
eturned Nicholas
. “You’re no
t cold?”  �
�No. I’m quite
", quite all righ"
t. I feel so com
fortable!” ans
"wered
Natásha,"
 almost perplexe
d by her feeling
s. They remained
 silent a long 
while. The night
 was dark and da
mp. They could n
ot see the horse
"s, but
only hea"
rd them splashin
g through the un
seen mud.  Wha
t was passing in
 that receptive 
childlike soul t
hat so eagerly c
aught and assim
ilated all the d
iverse impressio

did they all fi
nd place in her?
 But she was ver
y happy. As they
 were nearing ho
me she suddenly
 struck up the a
ir of As ‘twas
 growing dark la
st night—the 
tune of which sh
e had all the wa
y been trying to
 get and had at 
last caught.  
 “Got it?” s
aid Nicholas.  
 “What were yo

" just now, Nicho"

 Natásha.  T
hey were fond of
 asking one anot
her that questio

"...

"a, though she ha"
d in reality bee
n thinking about
 Prince Andrew 
at the same time
" as of the rest,"
 and of how he w
ould have liked
 “Uncle.” �
�And then I was 
saying to myself
" all the way,
�"
��How well Anís
ya carried herse
"lf, how well!’"
” And Nicholas
 heard her spon
"taneous, happy, "
ringing laughter
. “And do you 
"know,” she
su"
"ddenly said, “"
I know that I sh
all never again 
be as happy and 
 tranquil as I a
m now.”  “
"Rubbish, nonsens"
"e, humbug!” ex"
claimed Nicholas
", and he thought"
: “How charmi
ng this Natásha
 of mine is! I h
ave no other fri
end like her an
d never shall ha
ve. Why should s
he marry? We mig
ht always drive 
 about together!
”  “What a
 darling this Ni
cholas of mine i
s!” thought Na
tásha.  “Ah
", there are stil"
l lights in the 
drawing room!”
" she said, point"

 that gleamed in
vitingly in the 
moist velvety d

 CHAPTER VIII  
 Count Ilyá Ros
tóv had resigne
d the position o
f Marshal of the
 Nobility becau
se it involved h
im in too much e
"xpense, but stil"
l his affairs d
id not improve. 
Natásha and Nic
holas often noti
ced their parent
s conferring to
gether anxiously
 and privately a
nd heard suggest
ions of selling
 the fine ancest
ral Rostóv hous
e and estate nea
r Moscow. It was
 not necessary 
to entertain so 
freely as when t
he count had bee
"n Marshal,
and "
life at Otrádno
e was quieter th
an in former yea
"rs, but still th"
e enormous hous
e and its lodges
 were full of pe
ople and more th
an twenty sat d
own to table eve
ry day. These we
re all their own
 people who had 
 settled down in
 the house almos
t as members of 
"the family, or p"
ersons who were
", it seemed, obl"
iged to live in 
the count’s ho
use. Such were 
Dimmler the musi
cian and his wif
"e, Vogel the dan"
cing master and 
"his
family, Bel"
"óva, an old mai"
"den lady, an inm"
ate of the house
", and many
othe"
rs such as Péty
"a’s tutors, th"
e girls’ forme
"r governess, and"
 other people w
ho simply found 
it preferable an
d more advantage
ous to live in 
the count’s ho
use than at home
. They had not a
s many visitors 
"
as before, but "
the old habits o
f life without w
hich the count a
nd countess cou
ld not conceive 
of existence rem
ained unchanged.
 There was stil
l the hunting es
tablishment whic
h Nicholas had e
"ven enlarged, th"
e same fifty ho
rses and fifteen
 grooms in the s
"tables, the same"
 expensive pres
ents and dinner 
parties to the w
hole district on
 name days; ther
e were still th
e count’s game
s of whist and b
"oston, at which�"
��spreading out
 his cards so th
at everybody cou
ld see them—he
 let himself be 
 plundered of hu
ndreds of rubles
 every day by hi
"s neighbors, who"
 looked upon an
 opportunity to 
play a rubber wi
th Count Rostóv
 as a most prof
itable source of
 income.  The 
count moved in h
is affairs as in
" a huge net, try"
ing not to belie
ve that he was 
entangled but be
coming more and 
more so at every
" step, and
feel"
ing too feeble t
o break the mesh
es or to set to 
work carefully a
nd patiently to
 disentangle the
"m. The countess,"
 with her loving
" heart, felt
th"
at her children 
were being ruine
"d, that it was n"
ot the count’s
 fault for he c
ould not help be
ing what he was�
��that (though h
e tried to hide
 it) he himself 
suffered from th
e consciousness 
of his own and 
his children’s
" ruin, and she t"
ried to find mea
ns of remedying 
the position. F
rom her feminine
 point of view s
he could see onl
"y one
solution,"
" namely, for Nic"
holas to marry a
 rich heiress. S
he felt this to 
 be their last h
ope and that if 
Nicholas refused
 the match she h
ad found for hi
"m, she would hav"
e to abandon the
 hope of ever ge
tting matters r
ight. This match
 was with Julie 
"Karágina, the d"
aughter of excel
lent and virtuo
"us parents, a gi"
rl the Rostóvs 
had known from c
"hildhood, and
w"
ho had now becom
e a wealthy heir
ess through the 
death of the las
t of her brothe
rs.  The count
ess had written 
direct to Julie�
��s mother in Mo
scow suggesting 
 a marriage betw
een their childr
en and had recei
ved a favorable 
answer from her
. Karágina had 
replied that for
 her part she wa
"s agreeable, and"
 everything dep
end on her daugh
ter’s inclinat
ion. She invited
 Nicholas to co
me to Moscow.  
 Several times t
"he countess, wit"
h tears in her e
"yes, told her so"
n that now both
 her daughters w
"ere settled, her"
 only wish was t
o see him marri
ed. She said she
 could lie down 
in her grave pea
cefully if that 
 were accomplish
ed. Then she tol
d him that she k
new of a splendi
d girl and trie
d to discover wh
at he thought ab
out marriage.  
 At other times 
she praised Juli
e to him and adv
ised him to go t
o Moscow during
 the holidays to
 amuse himself. 
Nicholas guessed
 what his mothe
r’s remarks we
re leading to an
d during one of 
these conversati
ons induced her
 to speak quite 
frankly. She tol
d him that her o
nly hope of get
ting their affai
rs disentangled 
now lay in his m
arrying Julie K
arágina.  “
"But, Mamma, supp"
ose I loved a gi
rl who has no fo
"rtune, would
yo"
u expect me to s
acrifice my feel
ings and my hono
r for the sake o
f money?” he 
asked his mother
", not realizing "
the cruelty of h
is question and
 only wishing to
 show his noble-
mindedness.  �
"��No, you have n"
ot understood me
",” said his mo"
"ther, not knowin"
g how to justif
y herself. “Yo
u have not under
"stood me, Nikól"
enka. It is you
r happiness I wi
"sh for,” she a"
"dded, feeling th"
at she was telli
ng an untruth a
nd was becoming 
entangled. She b
egan to cry.  
"“Mamma, don’"
t cry! Only tell
 me that you wis
"h it, and you kn"
ow I will give 
"my life, anythin"
"g, to put you at"
" ease,” said N"
icholas. “I w
ould sacrifice a
nything for you�
��even my feelin
gs.”  But th
e countess did n
ot want the ques
tion put like th
at: she did not 
 want a sacrific
"e from her son, "
she herself wish
ed to make a sac
rifice for him.
"

“No, you h"
ave not understo
"od me, don’t l"
et us talk about
" it,” she
rep"
"lied, wiping awa"
y her tears.  
“Maybe I do lo
"ve a poor girl,�"
�� said Nicholas
 to himself. “
Am I to sacrifi
ce my feelings a
nd my honor for 
money? I wonder 
how Mamma could 
 speak so to me.
 Because Sónya 
is poor I must n
"ot love her,” "
"he
thought, “"
must not respond
 to her faithful
", devoted love? "
Yet I should ce
rtainly be happi
er with her than
 with some doll-
like Julie. I ca
n always sacrif
ice my feelings 
for my family’
"s welfare,” he"
 said to himsel
"f, “but I can�"
��t coerce my fe
elings. If I lov
"e Sónya, that
"
feeling is for m
e stronger and h
igher than all e
lse.”  Nicho
las did not go t
"o Moscow, and th"
e countess did n
ot renew the co
nversation with 
him about marria
ge. She saw with
" sorrow, and som"
etimes with exa
"speration, sympt"
oms of a growing
 attachment betw
een her son and 
 the portionless
 Sónya. Though 
she blamed herse
"lf for it, she c"
ould not refrai
n from grumbling
 at and worrying
" Sónya, often p"
ulling her up w
"ithout reason, a"
ddressing her st
iffly as “my d
"ear,” and usin"
g the formal �
�you” instead 
of the intimate 
“thou” in sp
eaking to her. 
The kindhearted 
countess was the
 more vexed with
 Sónya because 
"that
poor, dark"
-eyed niece of h
"ers was so meek,"
" so kind, so dev"
otedly grateful
 to her benefact
"ors, and so fait"
"hfully, unchangi"
"ngly, and
unsel"
fishly in love w
"ith Nicholas, th"
at there were no
 grounds for fi
nding fault with
 her.  Nichola
s was spending t
he last of his l
eave at home. A 
fourth letter ha
d come from Pri
"nce Andrew, from"
" Rome, in which "
he wrote that he
 would have bee
n on his way bac
k to Russia long
 ago had not his
 wound unexpecte
dly reopened in
 the warm climat
"e, which obliged"
 him to defer hi
s return till t
he beginning of 
the new year. Na
tásha was still
 as much in love
 with her betro
"thed, found the "
same comfort in 
"that love, and w"
as still as rea
dy to throw hers
elf into all the
 pleasures of li
fe as before; bu
t at the end of
 the fourth mont
h of their separ
ation she began 
to have fits of
 depression whic
h she could not 
master. She felt
 sorry for herse
lf: sorry that 
she was being wa
sted all this ti
me and of no use
 to anyone—wh
ile she felt her
self so capable 
of loving and be
ing loved.  Th
ings were not ch
eerful in the Ro
stóvs’ home. 
      CHAPT
ER IX  Christm
as came and exce
pt for the cerem
"onial Mass, the "
solemn and wear
isome Christmas 
congratulations 
from neighbors a
"nd servants, and"
 the new dresse
s everyone put o
"n, there were no"
 special festivi
"ties, though
th"
e calm frost of 
twenty degrees R
"éaumur, the daz"
zling sunshine b
"y day,
and the "
starlight of the
 winter nights s
eemed to call fo
r some special 
celebration of t
he season.  On
 the third day o
f Christmas week
", after the midd"
"ay dinner, all t"
he inmates of t
he house dispers
ed to various ro
oms. It was the 
dullest time of
 the day. Nichol
"as, who had been"
 visiting some n
eighbors that mo
"rning,
was asle"
ep on the sittin
g-room sofa. The
 old count was r
esting in his s
tudy. Sónya sat
 in the drawing 
room at the roun
"d table, copying"
 a design for e
mbroidery. The c
ountess was play
ing patience. Na
stásya Ivánov
na the buffoon s
at with a sad fa
ce at the window
 with two old l
adies. Natásha 
came into the ro
"om, went up to S"
"ónya, glanced a"
t what she was 
"doing, and then "
went up to her m
other and stood 
without speakin
g.  “Why are
 you wandering a
bout like an out
cast?” asked h
er mother. “W
hat do you want?
”  “Him...
 I want him... n
"ow, this minute!"
 I want him!” 
"said Natásha,
"
with glittering 
eyes and no sign
 of a smile.  
The countess lif
ted her head and
 looked attentiv
ely at her daugh
ter.  “Don�
"�t look at me, M"
amma! Don’t lo
ok; I shall cry 
directly.”  
“Sit down with
" me a little,”"
 said the counte
"ss.

“Mamma,"
 I want him. Why
 should I be was
"ted like this, M"
amma?”  Her 
"voice broke, tea"
rs gushed from h
"er eyes, and she"
 turned quickly 
to hide them an
d left the room.
  She passed i
nto the sitting 
"room, stood ther"
e thinking awhil
"e, and then
wen"
t into the maids
’ room. There 
an old maidserva
nt was grumbling
 at a young gir
l who stood pant
"ing, having just"
 run in through 
the cold from t
he serfs’ quar
ters.  “Stop
 playing—there
’s a time for 
"everything,” s"
aid the old wom
an.  “Let he
"r alone, Kondrá"
"tevna,” said N"
"atásha. “Go, "
"Mavrúshka,
go."
”  Having re
leased Mavrúshk
"a, Natásha cros"
sed the dancing 
hall and went t
o the vestibule.
 There an old fo
otman and two yo
ung ones were pl
aying cards. Th
ey broke off and
 rose as she ent
ered.  “What
 can I do with t
hem?” thought 
Natásha.  “
"Oh, Nikíta, ple"
ase go... where 
can I send him?.
".. Yes, go to th"
e yard and fetc
"h a fowl, please"
", a cock, and yo"
"u, Misha, bring "
me some oats.�
�  “Just a f
ew oats?” said
" Misha, cheerful"
ly and readily. 
"

“Go, go qui"
"ckly,” the old"
 man urged him. 
"

“And you, T"
"heodore, get me "
a piece of chalk
.”  On her w
ay past the butl
er’s pantry sh
e told them to s
"et a samovar,
t"
hough it was not
 at all the time
 for tea.  Fó
"ka, the butler, "
was the most ill
-tempered person
 in the house. 
Natásha liked t
o test her power
 over him. He di
strusted the ord
er and asked wh
ether the samova
r was really wan
ted.  “Oh de
"ar, what a young"
 lady!” said F
"óka, pretending"
 to frown at Na
tásha.  No on
e in the house s
ent people about
 or gave them as
 much trouble as
 Natásha did. 
She could not se
e people unconce
"rnedly, but had "
to send them on
 some errand. Sh
e seemed to be t
rying whether an
y of them would 
 get angry or su
lky with her; bu
t the serfs fulf
illed no one’s
 orders so read
ily as they did 
hers. “What ca
"n I do, where ca"
n I go?” thou
"ght she, as she "
went slowly alon
g the passage. 
 “Nastásya I
"vánovna, what s"
ort of children 
shall I have?”
 she asked the 
"buffoon, who was"
 coming toward h
er in a woman’
s jacket.  “
"Why, fleas, cric"
"kets, grasshoppe"
"rs,” answered "
the buffoon.  
"“O Lord, O Lor"
"d, it’s always"
" the same! Oh, w"
here am I to go?
 What am I to d
o with myself?�
� And tapping wi
"th her heels, sh"
e ran quickly u
pstairs to see V
ogel and his wif
e who lived on t
he upper story. 
  Two governess
es were sitting 
with the Vogels 
"at a table, on w"
hich were plate
"s of raisins, wa"
"lnuts, and almon"
ds. The governes
ses were discuss
ing whether it 
was cheaper to l
ive in Moscow or
 Odessa. Natásh
"a sat down,
lis"
tened to their t
alk with a serio
us and thoughtfu
"l air, and then "
got up again. 
 “The island 
"of Madagascar,�"
"� she said, “M"
"a-da-gas-car,”"
" she
repeated, "
articulating eac
h syllable disti
"nctly, and, not "
replying to Mad
ame Schoss who a
sked her what sh
"e was saying, sh"
e went out of th
e room.  Her 
brother Pétya w
as upstairs too;
 with the man in
 attendance on h
im he was prepa
ring fireworks t
o let off that n
ight.  “Pét
ya! Pétya!” s
he called to him
. “Carry me do
wnstairs.”  
Pétya ran up an
d offered her hi
s back. She jump
"ed on it, puttin"
g her arms roun
"d his neck, and "
he pranced along
 with her.  �
"�No, don’t... "
the island of Ma
dagascar!” she
" said, and jumpi"
ng off his back
 she went downst
airs.  Having 
as it were revie
"wed her kingdom,"
 tested her powe
"r, and made
sur"
e that everyone 
"was submissive, "
but that all the
 same it was dul
"l,
Natásha bet"
ook herself to t
"he ballroom, pic"
ked up her guita
"r, sat down
in "
a dark corner be
"hind a bookcase,"
 and began to ru
n her fingers ov
er the strings 
"in the bass, pic"
king out a passa
ge she recalled 
from an opera s
he had heard in 
Petersburg with 
Prince Andrew. W
hat she drew fro
m the guitar wo
uld have had no 
meaning for othe
"r listeners, but"
 in her imagina
tion a whole ser
ies of reminisce
nces arose from 
those sounds. S
he sat behind th
e bookcase with 
her eyes fixed o
n a streak of li
ght escaping fr
om the pantry do
or and listened 
to herself and p
ondered. She wa
s in a mood for 
brooding on the 
past.  Sónya 
passed to the pa
ntry with a glas
s in her hand. N
atásha glanced 
 at her and at t
he crack in the 
"pantry door, and"
 it seemed to he
r that she reme
mbered the light
 falling through
 that crack once
 before and Só
nya passing with
 a glass in her 
hand. “Yes it 
was exactly the 
"
same,” though"
t Natásha.  �
"��Sónya, what i"
s this?” she c
"ried, twanging a"
 thick string. 
"
“Oh, you are"
 there!” said 
Sónya with a st
"art, and came ne"
ar and listened
. “I don’t k
now. A storm?”
 she ventured ti
"midly, afraid of"
 being wrong. 
 “There! That
’s just how sh
e started and ju
st how she came 
up smiling timi
dly when all thi
s happened befor
"e,” thought Na"
"tásha, “and i"
n just the same
 way I thought t
here was somethi
ng lacking in he
"r.”

“No, "
it’s the choru
s from The Water
"-Carrier, listen"
!” and Natásh
a sang the air 
of the chorus so
 that Sónya sho
uld catch it. �
�Where were you
 going?” she a
sked.  “To c
hange the water 
in this glass. I
 am just finishi
ng the design.�
�  “You alwa
ys find somethin
"g to do, but I c"
"an’t,” said "
Natásha. “An
d where’s Nich
olas?”  “A
"sleep, I think.�"
"��

“Sónya,"
 go and wake him
",” said Natás"
ha. “Tell him 
I want him to c
ome and sing.”
  She sat awhi
"le, wondering wh"
at the meaning o
f it all having 
happened before
" could be, and w"
ithout solving t
"his problem, or "
at all regrettin
g not having do
"ne so, she again"
 passed in fancy
 to the time whe
n she was with 
him and he was l
ooking at her wi
th a lover’s e
"yes.

“Oh, i"
f only he would 
come quicker! I 
am so afraid it 
will never be! 
"And, worst of al"
"l, I am growing "
old—that’s t
he thing! There 
won’t then be
 in me what ther
e is now. But pe
rhaps he’ll co
"me today, will
"
come immediately
. Perhaps he has
 come and is sit
ting in the draw
ing room. Perha
ps he came yeste
rday and I have 
forgotten it.”
" She rose,
put "
"down the guitar,"
 and went to the
 drawing room. 
 All the domest
"ic circle, tutor"
"s, governesses, "
"and guests, were"
 already at the
 tea table. The 
servants stood r
ound the table�
�but Prince Andr
ew was not ther
e and life was g
oing on as befor
"e.

“Ah, her"
e she is!” sai
"d the old count,"
 when he saw Nat
ásha enter. �
"�Well, sit down "
by me.” But Na
tásha stayed by
 her mother and 
 glanced round a
s if looking for
 something.  �
��Mamma!” she 
"muttered, “giv"
"e him to me, giv"
"e him, Mamma, qu"
"ickly,
quickly!"
” and she agai
n had difficulty
 in repressing h
er sobs.  She 
sat down at the 
table and listen
ed to the conver
sation between t
he elders and N
"icholas, who had"
 also come to th
e table. “My G
"od, my God!
The"
" same faces, the"
" same talk, Papa"
 holding his cup
 and blowing in 
the same way!�
� thought Natás
"ha, feeling with"
 horror a sense 
of repulsion ri
sing up in her f
or the whole hou
"sehold, because "
they were always
 the same.  A
"fter tea, Nichol"
"as, Sónya, and "
Natásha went to
 the sitting roo
"m, to
their fav"
orite corner whe
re their most in
timate talks alw
ays began.   
   CHAPTER X 
  “Does it ev
er happen to you
",” said Natás"
ha to her brothe
"r, when
they se"
ttled down in th
"e sitting room, "
“does it ever 
happen to you to
 feel as if the
re were nothing 
more to come—n
othing; that eve
rything good is
 past? And to fe
el not exactly d
"ull, but sad?”"
  “I should 
think so!” he 
replied. “I ha
ve felt like tha
t when everythi
ng was all right
 and everyone wa
s cheerful. The 
thought has come
 into my mind t
hat I was alread
y tired of it al
"l, and that we m"
ust all die. On
ce in the regime
nt I had not gon
e to some merrym
aking where ther
e was music... 
and suddenly I f
elt so depressed
...”  “Oh 
"yes, I know, I k"
"now, I know!” "
Natásha interru
pted him. “Whe
n I was quite l
ittle that used 
to be so with me
. Do you remembe
r when I was pu
nished once abou
t some plums? Yo
u were all danci
"ng, and I sat
s"
obbing in the sc
hoolroom? I shal
l never forget i
t: I felt sad an
d sorry for eve
"ryone, for mysel"
"f, and for every"
one. And I was i
nnocent—that 
was the chief th
"ing,” said Nat"
ásha. “Do you
 remember?”  
"
“I remember,�"
�� answered Nich
olas. “I remem
ber that I came 
to you afterwar

"t do you know, I"
 felt ashamed t
o. We were terri
bly absurd. I ha
d a funny doll t
hen and wanted t
o give it to yo
u. Do you rememb

 do you remember
",” Natásha as"
ked with a pensi
"ve smile, “how"
"
once, long, lo"
"ng ago, when we "
were quite littl
"e, Uncle called "
us into the stu
dy—that was in
 the old house�
�and it was dark
—we went in an
d suddenly ther

"
“A Negro,” "
chimed in Nichol
as with a smile 
of delight. “O
f course I reme
mber. Even now I
 don’t know wh
ether there real

or if we only d
reamed it or wer

tood and looked 
 at us....”  
"
“Sónya, do y"
ou remember?” 
asked Nicholas. 
"

“Yes, yes, "
I do remember so
"mething too,” "
Sónya answered 
timidly.  “Y

sked Papa and Ma

N"

“How strange i

  So they went
 through their m
"emories, smiling"
 with pleasure: 
not the sad mem

uthful ones—th
ose impressions 
of one’s most
 distant past in

d—and they la
ughed with quiet
 enjoyment.  S
"ónya, as always"
", did not quite "
keep pace with t
"hem, though they"
 shared the sam
e reminiscences.
  Much that th
ey remembered ha
d slipped from h
"er mind, and wha"
t she recalled 
did not arouse t
he same poetic f
eeling as they e
xperienced. She 
 simply enjoyed 
their pleasure a
nd tried to fit 
in with it.  S
he only really t
ook part when th
ey recalled Són
ya’s first arr

them how afraid 
she had been of 
Nicholas because
 he had on a co
rded jacket and 
her nurse had to
"ld her that she,"
" too, would be s"
ewn up with cor

remember their t

"sha, “and I re"
member that I da

” she said in 
a whisper.  �
�It isn’t want

 them to take it

d Natásha.  
In the middle of
 their talk in t
"he sitting room,"
 Dimmler came in
 and went up to
 the harp that s
tood there in a 
corner. He took 
off its cloth c
"overing, and the"
 harp gave out a
 jarring sound. 
  “Mr. Dimmle
"r, please play m"
y favorite noctu
"rne by Field,”"
 came the old c
ountess’ voice
 from the drawin
g room.  Dimml
er struck a chor
"d and, turning t"
"o Natásha, Nich"
"olas, and Sónya"
",
remarked: “"
How quiet you yo
ung people are!�
"��

“Yes, we"
’re philosophi
"zing,” said Na"
"tásha, glancing"
 round for a mo
ment and then co
ntinuing the con
versation. They 
were now discuss
ing dreams.  
Dimmler began to
 play; Natásha 
went on tiptoe n
oiselessly to th
"e table,
took u"
"p a candle, carr"
"ied it out, and "
"returned, seatin"
g herself quietl
y in her former
 place. It was d
ark in the room 
especially where
 they were sitt
"ing on the sofa,"
 but through the
 big windows the
 silvery light o
f the full moon
 fell on the flo
or. Dimmler had 
finished the pie
ce but still sa
t softly running
 his fingers ove
"r the strings, e"
vidently uncert
ain whether to s
top or to play s
omething else. 
 “Do you know
",” said Natás"
"ha in a whisper,"
 moving closer t
o Nicholas and 
"Sónya, “that "
when one goes on
 and on recallin
"g memories, one "
at last begins 
to remember what
 happened before
 one was in the 
world....”  
“That is metem
"psychosis,” sa"
"id Sónya, who h"
ad always learne
"d well,
and rem"
embered everythi

ians believed th
at our souls hav

 back into anima
ls again.”  
"“No, I don’t"
 believe we ever
 were in animals
",” said Natás"
"ha,
still in a "
whisper though t
he music had cea
sed. “But I am
 certain that w
e were angels so

hy we remember.
...”  “May
 I join you?” 
said Dimmler who
 had come up qui
"etly, and he sat"
 down by them. 
  “If we have
" been angels, wh"
y have we fallen
 lower?” said 
Nicholas. “No
", that can’t b"
e!”  “Not 
"lower, who said "
we were lower?..
. How do I know 
what I was befo
re?” Natásha 
rejoined with co
nviction. “The
 soul is immort

if I shall alway
s live I must ha

 lived for a wh

"

“Yes, but "
it is hard for u
s to imagine ete

"ed Dimmler,
who"
 had joined the 
young folk with 
a mildly condesc
ending smile but
 now spoke as q
uietly and serio
usly as they.  
 “Why is it ha

Natásha. “It

"eplied Natásha,"
 but all the sa

"None of them, no"

wanted to break 
off their conve

Natásha "
got up and Nicho
las sat down at 
the clavichord. 
Standing as usu
al in the middle
 of the hall and
 choosing the pl
ace where the r
esonance was bes
"t, Natásha bega"
n to sing her mo
ther’s favorit

ad said she did 
not want to sing

g since she had 
"
sung, and long "
before she again
" sang, as she di"
d that evening. 
"The

"Sónya, as she

t of the immense
 difference ther
e was between he

mpossible it was
 for her to be a

with a blissful

ionally shaking 
her head. She t
hought of Natás

"n youth, and of "
how there was so
mething unnatur

in this impendin

“Ah, Countes"

“Ah, how a"

" countess,
not "
realizing to who

 that because of
 this she would
 not be happy. B

Natásha stopped

applauding the p

sappeared.  Ha
lf an hour later
 there appeared 
among the other 
mummers in the 
ballroom an old 
lady in a hooped
 skirt—this wa
s Nicholas. A Tu

Pétya. A clown 
was Dimmler. An 
hussar was Natá
"sha, and a
Circ"
assian was Sóny
a with burnt-cor
k mustache and e
yebrows.  Afte

hose who were n

 take them all 
for a drive in h

 them about a d

“No,"

said the countes

but that if Lou

the Melyukóvs�
"�, Sónya, gener"
ally so timid an

ently than anyon

 Ivánovna not t

nya’s costume 
was the best of

ere extraordina

veryone told her
 she looked very
" handsome,

she was in a spi

 with her. Some 
 inner voice tol
d her that now o

 would be decide

in her m"

eemed quite a di
fferent person. 
Louisa Ivánovna
 consented to g

n hour four troy
ka sleighs with 
large and small
" bells, their ru"

and whistling ov

 the porch.  N
atásha was fore
most in setting 
a merry holiday 
"tone, which, pas"
sing from one t

stronger and rea
ched its climax 
when they all c
ame out into the
 frost and got i
"nto the sleighs,"
" talking, callin"

"Nicholas, in his"

Natásha, "
"Sónya, Madame S"

s.  “You go

�� shouted Nicho
las to his fathe
"r’s
coachman,"
 wishing for a c

"yka, with Dimmle"
"r and his party,"
 started forward
",
squeaking on "
its runners as t
hough freezing t
"o the snow, its "
deep-toned bell
 clanging. The s
"ide horses, pres"
sing against the
 shafts of the 
"middle horse, sa"
"nk in the snow, "
which was dry an
d glittered like

and thr"
ew it up.  Nic
"holas set off, f"
ollowing the fir
st sleigh; behin
d him the others
"
moved noisily,"
 their runners s
queaking. At fir
st they drove at
 a steady trot 
along the narrow
 road. While the
y drove past the
 garden the shad
ows of the bare
 trees often fel
l across the roa
d and hid the br
illiant moonlig
"ht, but as soon "
as they were pas
"t the fence, the"
 snowy plain ba

t and motionless
 spread out befo
re them glitteri
ng like diamond
s and dappled wi
th bluish shadow
"s. Bang, bang! w"
ent the first s
leigh over a cra

snow of the road
", and each of
t"
he other sleighs
 jolted in the s
"ame way, and rud"
ely breaking the
 frost-bound st
"illness, the tro"
ykas began to sp
eed along the ro
"ad, one
after t"
he other.  “
A hare’s track
", a lot of track"
s!” rang out N
atásha’s voic
e through the f
rost-bound air. 
  “How light 
"it is, Nicholas!"
” came Sónya�
��s voice.  Ni
cholas glanced r
"ound at Sónya, "
and bent down to
 see her face cl
oser. Quite a n
"ew, sweet face w"
ith black eyebro
ws and mustaches
 peeped up at h
im from her sabl
e furs—so clos
e and yet so dis
tant—in the m
oonlight.  “
That used to be 
"Sónya,” thoug"
"ht he, and looke"
d at her closer 
and smiled.  
"“What is it, N"
icholas?”  �
"��Nothing,” sa"
id he and turned
 again to the ho
rses.  When th
ey came out onto
 the beaten high
road—polished 
by sleigh runner
s and cut up by
 rough-shod hoof
"s, the marks of "
which were visib
le in the moonl
ight—the horse
s began to tug a
t the reins of t
heir own accord 
and increased t
heir pace. The n
"ear side horse, "
arching his head
 and breaking i
nto a short cant
"er, tugged at hi"
s traces. The sh
aft horse swayed
 from side to s
"ide, moving his "
ears as if askin
g: “Isn’t it
 time to begin 
now?” In front
", already far ah"
ead the deep bel
l of the sleigh 
ringing farther
 and farther off
", the black hors"
es driven by Zak
hár could be c
learly seen agai
nst the white sn
ow. From that sl
eigh one could h
"ear the
shouts,"
" laughter, and v"
oices of the mum
mers.  “Gee 
"up, my darlings!"
” shouted Nich
"olas, pulling th"
e reins to one 
side and flouris
hing the whip. 
 It was only by
 the keener wind
 that met them a
nd the jerks giv
en by the side 
horses who pulle
d harder—ever 
increasing their
 gallop—that 
one noticed how 
fast the troyka 
was flying. Nich
olas looked back
". With
screams,"
" squeals, and wa"
ving of whips th
at caused even t
he shaft horses 
 to gallop—the
 other sleighs f
ollowed. The sha
ft horse swung s
teadily beneath
 the bow over it
"s head, with no "
thought of slack
ening pace and 
ready to put on 
speed when requi
red.  Nicholas
 overtook the fi
rst sleigh. They
 were driving do
wnhill and comi
ng out upon a br
oad trodden trac
k across a meado
"w, near a river."
  “Where are
 we?” thought 
he. “It’s th
"e Kosóy meadow,"
 I suppose. But
 no—this is so
mething new I’
ve never seen be
fore. This isn�
�t the Kosóy m
eadow nor the D�
"�mkin hill, and "
heaven only know
s what it is! I
t is something n
ew and enchanted
". Well, whatever"
 it may be...”
 And shouting t
"o his horses, he"
 began to pass t
he first sleigh.
  Zakhár held
 back his horses
 and turned his 
"face, which was "
already covered
 with hoarfrost 
to his eyebrows.
  Nicholas gav
e the horses the
" rein, and Zakh�"
"�r, stretching o"
"ut his arms,
cl"
ucked his tongue
 and let his hor
ses go.  “No
"w, look out, mas"
ter!” he cried
.  Faster stil
l the two troyka
s flew side by s
"ide, and faster "
moved the feet 
of the galloping
 side horses. Ni
cholas began to 
draw ahead. Zak
"hár, while stil"
l keeping his ar
"ms extended, rai"
sed one hand wit
h the reins.  
 “No you won�
"�t, master!” h"
e shouted.  Ni
cholas put all h
is horses to a g
allop and passed
 Zakhár. The ho
rses showered t
he fine dry snow
 on the faces of
 those in the sl
eigh—beside t
hem sounded quic
k ringing bells 
and they caught 
confused glimpse
s of swiftly mo
ving legs and th
e shadows of the
 troyka they wer
e passing. The 
whistling sound 
of the runners o
n the snow and t
he voices of gir
ls shrieking we
re heard from di
fferent sides. 
 Again checking
" his horses, Nic"
holas looked aro
und him. They we
re still surrou
nded by the magi
c plain bathed i
n moonlight and 
spangled with s
tars.  “Zakh
ár is shouting 
that I should tu
"rn to the left, "
but why to the 
left?” thought
 Nicholas. “Ar
e we getting to 
the Melyukóvs�
�? Is this Mely
ukóvka? Heaven 
only knows where
" we are going, a"
nd heaven knows 
 what is happeni
ng to us—but i
t is very strang
e and pleasant w
hatever it is.�
�� And he looked
 round in the sl
eigh.  “Look
", his mustache a"
nd eyelashes are
 all white!” s
aid one of the 
"strange, pretty,"
 unfamiliar peop
le—the one wit
h fine eyebrows 
and mustache. 
 “I think thi
s used to be Nat
"ásha,” though"
"t Nicholas, “a"
nd that was Mad
"ame Schoss, but "
perhaps it’s n
"ot, and this Cir"
cassian with the
 mustache I don
"’t know, but I"
 love her.”  
 “Aren’t you
 cold?” he ask
ed.  They did 
not answer but b
egan to laugh. D
immler from the 
sleigh behind s
houted something
—probably some
thing funny—bu
t they could not
 make out what 
he said.  “Y
"es, yes!” some"
 voices answered
", laughing.

��But here was a
 fairy forest wi
th black moving 
"shadows, and a g"
litter of diamo

 of marble steps
 and the silver 
roofs of fairy 
buildings and th
e shrill yells o
f some animals. 
And if this is r
eally Melyukóv
"ka, it is still "
stranger that we
 drove heaven kn

 It really was M

 said.  After 
Russian country

made the serfs a

"ring,

ver ruble were f
etched and they 
all played games
 together.  In
" an hour, all th"
e costumes were 
crumpled and dis
ordered. The cor

 smeared over th
"e perspiring, fl"

dmired their cle

rticularly how t
hey suited the 
"young ladies, an"

visitors were in
vited to supper 
in the drawing r

 in the ballroom
.  “Now to t

 “Why?” said
 the eldest Mely

��You wouldn’t

"“I’ll go,”"
 said Sónya.  
 “Tell what ha

d the second Mel

"
“Well,” beg"
"an the old maid,"
 “a young lady
" once went out, "
"took a

"Natásha, rollin"

"
“Yes, like a"

and she should h

t got frightened
 and hid her fac

Then he caught 
her up. It was l

agéya Danílovn
"a.

“Mamma, "
you used to try 
your fate yourse
lf...” said he
r daughter.  �
��And how does o
ne do it in a ba

Sónya.  “We
"ll, say you went"
 to the barn now
", and listened. "
It depends on wh
at you hear; ha
mmering and knoc
king—that’s 
bad; but a sound
 of shifting gr

one sometimes he
"ars that, too.�"
"�

“Mamma, t"
ell us what happ
ened to you in t

elagéya Danílo
vna smiled.  �
"��Oh, I’ve for"

 replied. “But
 none of you wou

"�Yes, I will; Pe"
lagéya Danílov
"na, let me! I’"
"ll go,” said S"
ónya.  “Wel
"l, why not, if y"
ou’re not afra
id?”  “Lou
"isa Ivánovna, m"
ay I?” asked S
ónya.  Whethe
r they were play
ing the ring and
 string game or 
the ruble game o
r talking as no
"w, Nicholas did "
not leave Sónya
"’s side, and g"
azed at her wit
h quite new eyes
. It seemed to h
im that it was o
"nly today, thank"
s to that burnt
"-cork mustache, "
that he had full
y learned to kno
w her. And real
"ly, that evening"
", Sónya was bri"
"ghter, more anim"
"ated, and pretti"
er than Nichola
s had ever seen 
her before.  �
��So that’s wh
at she is like; 
what a fool I ha
ve been!” he t
hought gazing a
t her sparkling 
"eyes, and under "
the mustache a h
appy rapturous 
smile dimpled he
"r cheeks, a smil"
e he had never s
een before.  �
��I’m not afra
"id of anything,�"
�� said Sónya. 
“May I go at o
nce?” She got
 up.  They tol
d her where the 
barn was and how
 she should stan
"d and listen,
a"
nd they handed h
er a fur cloak. 
She threw this o
ver her head and
 shoulders and 
glanced at Nicho
las.  “What 
a darling that g
irl is!” thoug
ht he. “And wh
at have I been 
thinking of till
 now?”  Són
ya went out into
 the passage to 
go to the barn. 
Nicholas went h
astily to the fr
"ont porch, sayin"
g he felt too ho
t. The crowd of 
people really h
ad made the hous
e stuffy.  Out
"side, there was "
the same cold st
illness and the 
"same moon, but e"
ven brighter th
an before. The l
ight was so stro
ng and the snow 
sparkled with s
o many stars tha
t one did not wi
sh to look up at
 the sky and the
 real stars wer
e unnoticed. The
 sky was black a
"nd dreary, while"
 the earth was 
gay.  “I am 
"a fool, a fool! "
what have I been
 waiting for?”
 thought Nichol
"as, and running "
out from the por
ch he went round
 the corner of 
the house and al
ong the path tha
t led to the bac
k porch. He knew
 Sónya would p
ass that way. Ha
lfway lay some s
now-covered pile
s of firewood an
d across and al
ong them a netwo
rk of shadows fr
om the bare old 
lime trees fell
 on the snow and
 on the path. Th
is path led to t
he barn. The log
 walls of the b
arn and its snow
"-covered roof, t"
hat looked as if
 hewn out of so
me precious ston
"e, sparkled in t"
he moonlight. A 
tree in the gard
en snapped with
" the frost, and "
then all was aga
in perfectly sil
ent. His bosom 
seemed to inhale
 not air but the
 strength of ete
rnal youth and 
gladness.  Fro
m the back porch
 came the sound 
of feet descendi
"ng the steps, th"
e bottom step u
pon which snow h
ad fallen gave a
 ringing creak a
nd he heard the
 voice of an old
 maidservant say
"ing, “Straight"
", straight, alon"
"g the
path, Mis"
"s. Only, don’t"
 look back.” 
 “I am not af
"raid,” answere"
d Sónya’s voi
"ce, and along th"
e path toward N
icholas came the
" crunching, whis"
tling sound of S
ónya’s feet 
in her thin shoe
s.  Sónya cam
"e along, wrapped"
 in her cloak. S
he was only a co
uple of paces a
way when she saw
" him, and to her"
 too he was not 
the Nicholas she
 had known and 
always slightly 
feared. He was i
n a woman’s dr
"ess, with
tousl"
ed hair and a ha
ppy smile new to
 Sónya. She ran
 rapidly toward 
 him.  “Quit
e different and 
"yet the same,”"
 thought Nichola
"s, looking at he"
r face all lit 
up by the moonli
ght. He slipped 
his arms under t
he cloak that c
"overed her head,"
" embraced her, p"
ressed her to hi
"m, and kissed he"
r on the lips t
hat wore a musta
che and had a sm
ell of burnt cor
k. Sónya kisse
d him full on th
"e lips, and dise"
ngaging her litt
le hands pressed
 them to his ch
eeks.  “Són
ya!... Nicholas!
”... was all t
hey said. They r
an to the barn 
and then back ag
"ain, re-entering"
", he by the fron"
t and she by the
 back porch.  
     CHAPTER
 XII  When the
y all drove back
 from Pelagéya 
"Danílovna’s, "
"Natásha, who
a"
lways saw and no
ticed everything
", arranged that "
she and Madame S
choss should go
 back in the sle
igh with Dimmler
", and Sónya wit"
h Nicholas and 
the maids.  On
 the way back Ni
cholas drove at 
a steady pace in
stead of racing 
and kept peerin
g by that fantas
tic all-transfor
ming light into 
Sónya’s face
 and searching b
eneath the eyebr
ows and mustache
 for his former 
and his present
 Sónya from who
m he had resolve
d never to be pa
rted again. He 
looked and recog
nizing in her bo
th the old and t
"he new Sónya, a"
nd being remind
ed by the smell 
of burnt cork of
 the sensation o
"f her kiss,
inh"
aled the frosty 
air with a full 
"breast and, look"
ing at the groun
d flying beneat
h him and at the
" sparkling sky, "
felt himself aga
in in fairyland
".

“Sónya, "
is it well with 
thee?” he aske
d from time to t
ime.  “Yes!�
�� she replied. 
“And with thee
?”  When hal
fway home Nichol
as handed the re
ins to the coach
man and ran for 
 a moment to Nat
ásha’s sleigh
 and stood on it
s wing.  “Na
tásha!” he wh
ispered in Frenc
"h, “do you kno"
w I have made up
 my mind about 
Sónya?”  �
�Have you told h
er?” asked Nat
"ásha, suddenly "
beaming all over
 with joy.  �
"��Oh, how strang"
e you are with t
hat mustache and
 those eyebrows!
... Natásha—
are you glad?”
  “I am so g
"lad, so glad! I "
was beginning to
 be vexed with y
ou. I did not t
"ell you, but you"
 have been treat
ing her badly. W
hat a heart she 
"
has, Nicholas! "
I am horrid some
"times, but I was"
 ashamed to be h
appy while Són
"ya was not,” c"
ontinued Natásh
a. “Now I am s
"o glad! Well,
r"
un back to her.�
"��

“No, wai"
"t a bit.... Oh, "
how funny you lo
ok!” cried Nic
"holas, peering
"
into her face an
d finding in his
 sister too some
"thing new, unusu"
"al, and
bewitch"
ingly tender tha
t he had not see
n in her before.
" “Natásha,
i"
"t’s magical, i"
sn’t it?”  
"
“Yes,” she "
replied. “You 
have done splend
idly.”  “H
ad I seen her be
fore as she is n
"ow,” thought N"
"icholas, “I sh"
ould long ago h
ave asked her wh
at to do and hav
e done whatever 
"she told me,
an"
d all would have
 been well.” 
 “So you are 
glad and I have 
done right?” 
"
“Oh, quite r"
ight! I had a qu
arrel with Mamma
 some time ago a
bout it. Mamma 
said she was ang
ling for you. Ho
w could she say 
such a thing! I 
 nearly stormed 
at Mamma. I will
 never let anyon
e say anything b
"ad of
Sónya, f"
or there is noth
ing but good in 
her.”  “Th
en it’s all ri
ght?” said Nic
"holas, again scr"
utinizing the e
xpression of his
 sister’s face
 to see if she w
as in earnest. T
hen he jumped d
"own and, his boo"
ts scrunching th
"e snow, ran back"
 to his sleigh. 
"
The same happy,"
 smiling Circass
"ian, with mustac"
he and beaming e
yes looking up 
from under a sab
"le hood, was sti"
ll sitting there
", and that
Circ"
assian was Sóny
"a, and that Són"
ya was certainly
 his future happ
y and loving wi
fe.  When they
 reached home an
d had told their
 mother how they
 had spent the 
evening at the M
"elyukóvs’, th"
e girls went to 
their bedroom. W
hen they had un
"dressed, but wit"
hout washing off
 the cork mustac
"hes, they sat a"
 long time talki
ng of their happ
iness. They talk
ed of how they w
ould live when 
they were marrie
"d, how their hus"
bands would be f
"riends, and how"
 happy they woul
d be. On Natásh
a’s table stoo
d two looking gl
asses which Dun
yásha had prepa
red beforehand. 
  “Only when 
will all that be
? I am afraid ne
ver.... It would
 be too good!�
"� said Natásha,"
 rising and goin
g to the looking
 glasses.  “
"Sit down, Natás"
ha; perhaps you�
"��ll see him,”"
 said Sónya.  
 Natásha lit th
"e candles, one o"
n each side of o
ne of the lookin
"g
glasses, and "
sat down.  “
I see someone wi
"th a mustache,�"
"� said Natásha,"
 seeing her own 
face.  “You 
"mustn’t laugh,"
" Miss,” said D"
unyásha.  Wit
h Sónya’s hel
p and the maid�
"�s, Natásha got"
 the glass she h
eld into the ri
ght position opp
osite the other;
 her face assume
d a serious exp
ression and she 
sat silent. She 
sat a long time 
looking at the 
receding line of
 candles reflect
ed in the glasse
s and expecting 
(from tales she
 had heard) to s
"ee a coffin, or "
"him, Prince Andr"
"ew, in that
las"
"t dim, indistinc"
tly outlined squ
are. But ready a
s she was to tak
e the smallest 
speck for the im
age of a man or 
"of a coffin, she"
 saw nothing. S
he began blinkin
g rapidly and mo
ved away from th
e looking glasse
s.  “Why is 
it others see th
ings and I don�
�t?” she said.
 “You sit dow
"n now, Sónya. Y"
ou absolutely mu
"st, tonight! Do "
it for me.... To
day I feel so f
rightened!”  
 Sónya sat down
 before the glas
"ses, got the rig"
"ht position, and"
 began looking.
"

“Now, Miss"
 Sónya is sure 
to see something
",” whispered D"
unyásha; “wh
ile you do nothi
ng but laugh.”
  Sónya heard
 this and Natás
ha’s whisper: 
  “I know she
 will. She saw s
omething last ye
ar.”  For ab
out three minute
s all were silen
t.  “Of cour
se she will!” 
whispered Natás
"ha, but did not "
finish... sudde
nly Sónya pushe
d away the glass
 she was holding
 and covered her
 eyes with her 
"hand.

“Oh, "
Natásha!” she
 cried.  “Di
d you see? Did y
ou? What was it?
” exclaimed Na
"tásha, holding "
up the looking 
glass.  Sónya
 had not seen an
"ything, she was "
just wanting to 
blink and to get
 up when she he
ard Natásha say
", “Of course s"
he will!” She 
did not wish to
 disappoint eith
er Dunyásha or 
"Natásha, but it"
 was hard to sit
 still. She did
 not herself kno
w how or why the
 exclamation esc
aped her when s
he covered her e
yes.  “You s
aw him?” urged
" Natásha, seizi"
ng her hand.  
“Yes. Wait a b
it... I... saw h
"im,” Sónya co"
uld not help say
"ing, not
yet kn"
owing whom Natá
sha meant by him
", Nicholas or Pr"
ince Andrew.  
“But why shoul
dn’t I say I s
aw something? Ot
hers do see! Bes
ides who can te
ll whether I saw
 anything or not
?” flashed thr
ough Sónya’s 
 mind.  “Yes
", I saw him,” "
she said.  “
How? Standing or
 lying?”  �
"�No, I saw... At"
 first there was
" nothing, then I"
 saw him lying 
down.”  “A
ndrew lying? Is 
he ill?” asked
" Natásha, her f"
rightened eyes f
ixed on her fri
"end.

“No, o"
"n the contrary, "
on the contrary!
 His face was ch
"eerful, and he
"
turned to me.”
 And when saying
 this she hersel
f fancied she ha
d really seen w
hat she describe

“Well, a"
"nd then, Sónya?"
...”  “Aft
"er that, I could"
 not make out wh

mething blue and

“Sónya! When 
will he come bac

"see him! O, God,"
 how afraid I a

.” Natásha b
"egan, and withou"
t replying to S�

 long after her 
candle was out l

 CHAPTER XIII  
 Soon after the 
Christmas holida
ys Nicholas told
 his mother of h
is love for Só
nya and of his f
irm resolve to m
arry her. The co
"untess, who
had"
 long noticed wh
at was going on 
between them and
 was expecting t
his declaration
", listened to hi"
m in silence and
 then told her s
on that he migh
t marry whom he 
"pleased, but tha"
t neither she no
r his father wou
ld give their b
lessing to such 
a marriage. Nich
"olas, for the fi"
"rst time,
felt "
that his mother 
was displeased w
ith him and that
", despite her lo"
"ve
for him, she"
 would not give 
"way. Coldly, wit"
hout looking at 
"her son,
she se"
nt for her husba
"nd and, when he "
"came, tried brie"
fly and coldly t
o inform him of
" the facts, in h"
er son’s prese
"nce, but unable "
to restrain her
self she burst i
nto tears of vex
ation and left t
he room. The old
 count began ir
resolutely to ad
monish Nicholas 
and beg him to a
bandon his purp
ose. Nicholas re
plied that he co
uld not go back 
"on his word, and"
" his
father, si"
ghing and eviden
tly disconcerted
", very soon beca"
me silent and w
ent in to the co
untess. In all h
is encounters wi
"th his son, the "
count was alway
s conscious of h
is own guilt tow
ard him for havi
ng wasted the f
"amily fortune, a"
nd so he could n
ot be angry with
 him for refusin
g to marry an h
eiress and choos
ing the dowerles
s Sónya. On thi
"s occasion, he
"
was only more vi
vidly conscious 
of the fact that
 if his affairs 
had not been in
" disorder, no be"
tter wife for Ni
cholas than Són
ya could have b
"een wished for, "
and that no one 
but himself with
 his Mítenka an
d his uncomfort
able habits was 
to blame for the
 condition of th
e family financ
es.  The fathe
r and mother did
 not speak of th
e matter to thei
"r son again,
bu"
t a few days lat
er the countess 
sent for Sónya 
"and, with a crue"
lty neither of 
"them expected, r"
eproached her ni
ece for trying t
o catch Nichola
s and for ingrat
itude. Sónya li
stened silently 
with downcast e
yes to the count
ess’ cruel wor
"ds, without unde"
rstanding what 
was required of 
her. She was rea
dy to sacrifice 
everything for h
er benefactors.
 Self-sacrifice 
was her most che
rished idea but 
in this case sh
e could not see 
what she ought t
"o sacrifice, or "
for whom. She co
uld not help lo
ving the countes
s and the whole 
"Rostóv family, "
but neither cou
ld she help lovi
ng Nicholas and 
knowing that his
 happiness depen
ded on that lov
e. She was silen
t and sad and di
d not reply. Nic
holas felt the 
situation to be 
intolerable and 
went to have an 
explanation with
 his mother. He
 first implored 
her to forgive h
im and Sónya an
d consent to th
"eir marriage, th"
en he threatened
 that if she mol
ested Sónya he 
would at once m
arry her secretl
y.  The counte
"ss, with a coldn"
ess her son had 
never seen in he
"r before,
repli"
ed that he was o
"f age, that Prin"
ce Andrew was ma
rrying without h
is father’s c
"onsent, and he c"
ould do the same
", but that she w"
ould never rece
ive that intrigu
er as her daught
er.  Exploding
 at the word int
"riguer, Nicholas"
", raising his vo"
"ice, told
his m"
other he had nev
er expected her 
to try to force 
him to sell his 
"
feelings, but i"
"f that were so, "
he would say for
 the last time..
.. But he had n
o time to utter 
the decisive wor
d which the expr
ession of his fa
ce caused his m
other to await w
"ith terror, and "
which would perh
aps have foreve
r remained a cru
el memory to the
m both. He had n
ot time to say i
"t,
for Natásha"
", with a pale an"
"d set face, ente"
red the room fro
m the door at w
hich she had bee
n listening.  
"“Nicholas, you"
 are talking non
"sense! Be quiet,"
" be quiet, be qu"
"iet, I
tell you"
!...” she almo
"st screamed, so "
as to drown his 
voice.  “Mam
"ma darling, it�"
�s not at all so
"... my poor, swe"
"et darling,” s"
he said to her 
"mother, who cons"
cious that they 
had been on the 
brink of a rupt
ure gazed at her
 son with terror
", but in the obs"
tinacy and exci
tement of the co
nflict could not
 and would not g
ive way.  “N
"icholas, I’ll "
explain to you. 
"Go away! Listen,"
" Mamma darling,�"
�� said Natásh
a.  Her words 
"were incoherent,"
 but they attain
ed the purpose a
t which she was
 aiming.  The 
"countess, sobbin"
"g heavily, hid h"
er face on her d
aughter’s brea
"st,
while Nicho"
"las rose, clutch"
"ing his head, an"
d left the room.
  Natásha set
 to work to effe
ct a reconciliat
"ion, and so far "
succeeded that 
Nicholas receive
d a promise from
 his mother that
 Sónya should n
"ot
be troubled,"
 while he on his
 side promised n
ot to undertake 
anything withou
t his parents’
 knowledge.  F
"irmly resolved, "
after putting hi
s affairs in ord
er in the regime
"nt,
to retire f"
rom the army and
 return and marr
"y Sónya, Nichol"
"as, serious,
so"
"rrowful, and at "
variance with hi
"s parents, but, "
as it seemed to 
"him,
passionate"
"ly in love, left"
 at the beginnin
g of January to 
rejoin his regi
ment.  After N
icholas had gone
 things in the R
ostóv household
 were more depr
essing than ever

 unhappy at the

Nicholas and sti

ccount of the ho
stile tone the c
ountess could no
t help adopting 
toward her. The
 count was more 
perturbed than e
ver by the condi
tion of his aff
"airs, which call"
ed for some deci
sive action. The
ir town house an
d estate near M
oscow had inevit
"ably to be sold,"
 and for this th
ey had to go to
 Moscow. But the
 countess’ hea
lth obliged them
 to delay their 
 departure from

"atásha, who had"
 borne the first
 period of separ

er to think that
 while she lived
 only in the th
"ought of him, he"
 was living a re
"al life, seeing "
new places and n
ew people that 
interested him. 
The more interes
ting his letters
 were the more 
vexed she felt. 
Her letters to h
"im, far from giv"
ing her any com

her a wearisome 
and artificial o
bligation. She c

 because she cou

She wrote to him

she attached no

"st, and most mag"
nanimous of cran
"ks, a heedless, "
genial nobleman 
of the old Russ

and had "
it not been for 
two friends who 
had borrowed lar

 have given ever

ere was never a

on as he sank in
to his place on

an. When there 
"were quarrels, h"
is kindly smile 
and well-timed j

  Pierre was o
ne of those reti
red gentlemen-in
-waiting of whom
 there were hun
dreds good-humor
edly ending thei
r days in Moscow
.  How horrifi
ed he would have
 been seven year
"s before, when h"
e first arrived
" from abroad, ha"
d he been told t
hat there was no
 need for him t
o seek or plan a
"nything, that hi"
s rut had long b
"een shaped, eter"
nally predeterm
"ined, and that w"
riggle as he mig
"ht, he would be "
what all in his
 position were. 
He could not hav
e believed it! H
ad he not at one
 time longed wi
th all his heart
 to establish a 
republic in Russ
ia; then himsel
f to be a Napole
on; then to be a
 philosopher; an
d then a strate
gist and the con
queror of Napole
on? Had he not s
een the possibi
"lity of, and pas"
sionately desire
"d, the regenerat"
ion of the sinfu
"l
human race, a"
nd his own progr
ess to the highe
st degree of per
fection? Had he
 not established
 schools and hos
pitals and liber
ated his serfs? 
  But instead o
f all that—her
"e he was, the we"
althy husband of
 an unfaithful 
"wife, a retired "
gentleman-in-wai
"ting, fond of ea"
ting and drinki
"ng and, as he un"
buttoned his wai
"stcoat, of abusi"
ng the governmen
"t
a bit, a memb"
er of the Moscow
" English Club, a"
nd a universal f
avorite in Mosc
ow society. For 
a long time he c
ould not reconci
le himself to th
e idea that he 
was one of those
 same retired Mo
scow gentlemen-i
n-waiting he ha
d so despised se
ven years before
.  Sometimes h
e consoled himse
lf with the thou
ght that he was 
only living thi
s life temporari

was shocked by t
he thought of ho
"w
many, like hi"
"mself, had enter"
ed that life and
 that club tempo
"rarily,
with al"
l their teeth an
"d hair, and had "
only left it whe
n not a single 
tooth or hair re
mained.  In mo
"ments of pride, "
when he thought 
of his position 
it seemed to hi
m that he was qu
ite different an
d distinct from 
those other reti
red gentlemen-i
n-waiting he had
 formerly despis
ed: they were em
"pty, stupid,
co"
"ntented fellows,"
 satisfied with 
"their position, "
“while I am st
ill discontente

against which m
an is powerless�
��to the conditi

fter living some
 time in Moscow 
he no longer de
"spised, but bega"

erre no longer s

", but the malady"
 that had former
ly found express
ion in such acu
te attacks was d
riven inwards an
d never left him
 for a moment. 
“What for? Why
? What is going 
on in the world?
” he would ask
 himself in per
plexity several 
"times a day, inv"
oluntarily begin
ning to reflect 
 anew on the mea
ning of the phen
omena of life; b
ut knowing by ex
perience that t
here were no ans
wers to these qu
estions he made 
haste to turn aw
"ay
from them, a"
nd took up a boo
"k, or hurried of"
f to the club or
 to Apollón Ni

to exchange the

We all profess t

in honor of whic
h we have built

 was knouted to
 death and a min
ister of that sa

"a

the soldier a cr

.” So thought
" Pierre, and the"
 whole of this g
eneral deception
 which everyone 
"
accepts, accust"
omed as he was t
"o it, astonished"
 him each time a
s if it were so
mething new. “
I understand the
 deception and c
"onfusion,” he"
"
thought, “but"
 how am I to tel
l them all that 
I see? I have tr
"ied, and
have a"
lways found that
 they too in the
 depths of their
 souls understan
"d
it as I do, a"
nd only try not 
to see it. So it
 appears that it
 must be so! Bu
t I—what is to
 become of me?�
� thought he. He
 had the unfort
unate capacity m
"any men, especia"
"lly Russians, ha"
ve of seeing and
 believing in t
he possibility o
f goodness and t
"ruth, but of see"
ing the evil an
d falsehood of l
ife too clearly 
to be able to ta
ke a serious par
t in it. Every 
sphere of work w
"as connected, in"
" his eyes, with "
evil and decept
ion. Whatever he
" tried to be, wh"
atever he engage
"d in, the evil a"
nd falsehood of
 it repulsed him
 and blocked eve
ry path of activ
ity. Yet he had
 to live and to 
find occupation.
 It was too drea
dful to be under
 the burden of 
these insoluble 
"problems, so he "
abandoned himsel
f to any distra
ction in order t
o forget them. H
e frequented eve
ry kind of soci
"ety, drank much,"
 bought pictures
", engaged in bui"
"lding, and above"
 all—read.  
"
He read, and re"
ad everything th
at came to hand.
" On coming home,"
 while his vale
ts were still ta
king off his thi
"ngs, he picked u"
p a book and be
gan to read. Fro
m reading he pas
"sed to sleeping,"
 from sleeping t
o gossip in dra
wing rooms of th
"e club, from gos"
sip to carousals
 and women; fro
m carousals back
" to gossip, read"
"ing, and wine. D"
rinking became m
ore and more a 
physical and als
o a moral necess
ity. Though the 
doctors warned 
him that with hi
s corpulence win
e was dangerous 
"for him, he
dra"
nk a great deal.
 He was only qui
te at ease when 
having poured se
veral glasses o
f wine mechanica
lly into his lar
ge mouth he felt
 a pleasant war
"mth in his body,"
 an amiability t
oward all his fe
"llows, and a
re"
adiness to respo
nd superficially
 to every idea w
ithout probing i
t deeply. Only 
after emptying a
 bottle or two d
id he feel dimly
 that the terri
bly tangled skei
n of life which 
previously had t
errified him was
 not as dreadfu
l as he had thou
ght. He was alwa
ys conscious of 
some aspect of 
"that skein, as w"
ith a buzzing in
 his head after 
dinner or suppe
r he chatted or 
listened to conv
ersation or read
. But under the 
 influence of wi
ne he said to hi
mself: “It doe
sn’t matter. I
’ll get it un
raveled. I have 
a solution ready
", but have no ti"
me now—I’ll 
 think it all ou
t later on!” B
ut the later on 
never came.  I
"n the morning, o"
n an empty stoma
"ch, all the old "
questions appear
ed as insoluble
 and terrible as
" ever, and Pierr"
e hastily picked
" up a book, and"
 if anyone came 
to see him he wa
s glad.  Somet
imes he remember
ed how he had he
ard that soldier
s in war when e
ntrenched under 
the enemy’s fi
"re, if they have"
" nothing to do, "
try hard to fin
d some occupatio
n the more easil
y to bear the da
nger. To Pierre
 all men seemed 
like those soldi
"ers, seeking ref"
uge from life: 
some in ambition
", some in cards,"
 some in framing
" laws, some in w"
"omen,
some in t"
"oys, some in hor"
"ses, some in pol"
"itics, some in s"
"port, some
in w"
"ine, and some in"
 governmental af
fairs. “Nothin
"g is trivial, an"
d nothing is im
"portant, it’s "
all the same—o
nly to save ones
elf from it as 
"best one can,”"
 thought Pierre.
 “Only not to 
"see it, that dre"
adful it!”

 his daughter m

At that time ent
husiasm for the 
Emperor Alexande
r’s regime ha
d weakened and a
 patriotic and a
nti-French tende
ncy prevailed t
"here, and this, "
together with hi
s past and his i
ntellect and his
"
originality, a"
t once made Prin
ce Nicholas Bolk
ónski an object
 of particular 
respect to the M
oscovites and th
e center of the 
Moscow oppositi
on to the govern
ment.  The pri
nce had aged ver
y much that year
. He showed mark
ed signs of sen
ility by a tende
ncy to fall asle
"ep, forgetfulnes"
s of quite recen
"t
events, remem"
brance of remote
" ones, and the c"
hildish vanity w
ith which he ac
cepted the role 
of head of the M
oscow opposition
. In spite of th
is the old man 
inspired in all 
his visitors ali
ke a feeling of 
respectful vene
ration—especia
lly of an evenin
g when he came i
n to tea in his 
 old-fashioned c
oat and powdered
" wig and, arouse"
"d by anyone, tol"
d his abrupt st
ories of the pas
"t, or uttered ye"
t more abrupt an
d scathing crit
icisms of the pr
esent. For them 
"all, that old-fa"
shioned house wi
th its gigantic
" mirrors, pre-Re"
volution furnitu
"re, powdered foo"
"tmen, and
the s"
tern shrewd old 
man (himself a r
elic of the past
 century) with h
is gentle daugh
ter and the pret
ty Frenchwoman w
ho were reverent
ly devoted to h
im presented a m
ajestic and agre
eable spectacle.
 But the visitor
s did not refle
ct that besides 
the couple of ho
urs during which
 they saw their
" host, there wer"
e also twenty-tw
o hours in the d
ay during which 
the private and
 intimate life o
f the house cont
inued.  Latter
ly that private 
life had become 
very trying for 
Princess Mary. 
There in Moscow 
she was deprived
 of her greatest
 pleasures—tal
ks with the pil
grims and the so
litude which ref
reshed her at Ba
ld Hills—and 
she had none of 
the advantages a
nd pleasures of 
city life. She d
id not go out i
nto society; eve
ryone knew that 
her father would
 not let her go
 anywhere withou
"t him, and his f"
ailing health pr
evented his goin
"g out
himself, "
so that she was 
not invited to d
inners and eveni
ng parties. She 
 had quite aband
oned the hope of
 getting married
. She saw the co
ldness and male
volence with whi
ch the old princ
e received and d
ismissed the yo
"ung men, possibl"
"e suitors, who s"
ometimes appeare
d at their house
. She had no fr
iends: during th
is visit to Mosc
ow she had been 
disappointed in 
 the two who had
 been nearest to
 her. Mademoisel
"le Bourienne, wi"
th whom she had
 never been able
 to be quite fra
"nk, had now beco"
me unpleasant to
"
her, and for v"
arious reasons P
rincess Mary avo
"ided her. Julie,"
 with whom she 
had corresponded
 for the last fi
"ve years, was in"
" Moscow, but pro"
ved to be quite
 alien to her wh
en they met. Jus
"t then Julie, wh"
o by the death 
of her brothers 
had become one o
f the richest he
iresses in Mosco
"w,
was in the f"
ull whirl of soc
iety pleasures. 
She was surround
ed by young men
" who, she fancie"
"d, had suddenly "
learned to appre
ciate her worth.
 Julie was at t
hat stage in the
 life of a socie
ty woman when sh
e feels that he
r last chance of
 marrying has co
me and that her 
fate must be de
cided now or nev
er. On Thursdays
 Princess Mary r
emembered with a
 mournful smile
 that she now ha
d no one to writ
"e to, since Juli"
e—whose prese
nce gave her no 
pleasure was her
e and they met e
very week. Like 
the old émigr�
� who declined t
o marry the lady
 with whom he ha
d spent his eve
"nings for years,"
 she regretted J
ulie’s presenc
e and having no 
one to write to
. In Moscow Prin
cess Mary had no
" one to talk to,"
 no one to whom
 to confide her 
"sorrow, and much"
 sorrow fell to 
her lot just the
n. The time for
 Prince Andrew�
�s return and ma
rriage was appro
"aching, but
his"
 request to her 
to prepare his f
ather for it had
 not been carrie
"d
out; in fact,"
 it seemed as if
 matters were qu
"ite hopeless, fo"
r at every ment
ion of the young
 Countess Rostó
va the old princ
e (who apart fro
m that was usua
lly in a bad tem
per) lost contro
l of himself. An
other lately ad
ded sorrow arose
 from the lesson
s she gave her s
ix year-old nep
hew. To her cons
ternation she de
tected in hersel
f in relation to
 little Nichola
s some symptoms 
of her father’
s irritability. 
However often s
he told herself 
that she must no
t get irritable 
when teaching he
"r
nephew, almos"
t every time tha
"t, pointer in ha"
"nd, she sat down"
 to show him th
e French alphabe
"t, she so longed"
 to pour her own
 knowledge quick
ly and easily i
nto the child—
who was already 
afraid that Aunt
ie might at any
 moment get angr
y—that at his 
slightest inatte
ntion she trembl
"ed,
became flus"
tered and heated
", raised her voi"
"ce, and sometime"
s pulled him by
 the arm and put
 him in the corn
er. Having put h
im in the corner
 she would hers
elf begin to cry
" over her cruel,"
" evil nature, an"
d little Nichol
"as, following he"
"r example, would"
" sob, and withou"
t permission wou
ld leave his co
"rner, come to he"
"r, pull her wet "
hands from her f
"ace, and
comfor"
t her. But what 
distressed the p
rincess most of 
all was her fat
her’s irritabi
"lity, which was "
always directed 
against her and 
had of late amo
unted to cruelty
. Had he forced 
her to prostrate
 herself to the
 ground all nigh
"t, had he beaten"
 her or made her
 fetch wood or w
"ater,
it would "
never have enter
ed her mind to t
hink her positio
n hard; but thi
s loving despot�
��the more cruel
 because he love
d her and for th
at reason torme
nted himself and
 her—knew how 
not merely to hu
rt and humiliat
e her deliberate
"ly, but to show "
her that she was
 always to blame
 for everything
. Of late he had
 exhibited a new
 trait that torm
ented Princess 
Mary more than a
nything else; th
is was his ever-
increasing inti
macy with Mademo
iselle Bourienne
. The idea that 
at the first mom
ent of receivin
g the news of hi
s son’s intent
ions had occurre
d to him in jes
t—that if Andr

 Princess Mary f

A few minutes la

 CHAPTER III  
 In 1811 there w
as living in Mos
cow a French doc
tor—Métivier�
��who had rapid
ly become the fa
shion. He was en
"ormously tall, h"
"andsome, amiable"
 as Frenchmen a
"re, and was, as "
"all Moscow said,"
 an extraordinar
ily clever doct
or. He was recei
ved in the best 
houses not merel
"y as a doctor, b"
ut as an equal.
  Prince Nicho
las had always r
idiculed medicin
"e, but latterly "
on Mademoiselle
 Bourienne’s a
dvice had allowe
d this doctor to
 visit him and 
had grown accust
omed to him. Mé
tivier came to s
ee the prince ab
out twice a wee
k.  On Decembe
r 6—St. Nichol
as’ Day and th
e prince’s nam
e day—all Mos
cow came to the 
prince’s front
 door but he gav
e orders to admi
t no one and to
 invite to dinne
r only a small n
"umber, a list of"
 whom he gave t
o Princess Mary.
"

Métivier, w"
ho came in the m
orning with his 
"felicitations, c"
onsidered it pr
oper in his qual
ity of doctor de
 forcer la consi
"gne, * as he tol"
d Princess Mary
", and went in to"
 see the prince.
 It happened tha
t on that morni
ng of his name d
ay the prince wa
s in one of his 
worst moods. He 
had been going 
about the house 
all the morning 
finding fault wi
th everyone and
 pretending not 
to understand wh
at was said to h
im and not to be
 understood him
self. Princess M
ary well knew th
is mood of quiet
 absorbed queru
"lousness, which "
generally culmin
ated in a burst 
"of rage, and she"
 went about all
 that morning as
 though facing a
 cocked and load
ed gun and awai
ted the inevitab
le explosion. Un
til the doctor�
�s arrival the 
morning had pass
ed off safely. A
fter admitting t
"he doctor, Princ"
ess Mary sat do
wn with a book i
n the drawing ro
om near the door
 through which s
he could hear a
ll that passed i
n the study.  
    * To force t
he guard.  At 
first she heard 
only Métivier�
"�s voice, then h"
"er father’s, t"
hen both voices
 began speaking 
at the same time
", the door was f"
"lung open,
and "
on the threshold
 appeared the ha
ndsome figure of
 the terrified 
Métivier with h
is shock of blac
"k hair, and the "
prince in his dr
essing gown and
" fez, his face d"
istorted with fu
ry and the pupil
s of his eyes r
olled downwards.
  “You don�
�t understand?�
� shouted the pr
"ince, “but I d"
"o! French
spy, "
slave of Buonapa
"rte, spy, get ou"
t of my house! B
"e off, I tell
y"
ou...” and he 
slammed the door
".

Métivier, "
shrugging his sh
"oulders, went up"
 to Mademoiselle
 Bourienne who 
at the sound of 
shouting had run
 in from an adjo
ining room.  �
��The prince is 
not very well: b
ile and rush of 
blood to the hea
"d. Keep
calm, I"
 will call again
" tomorrow,” sa"
id Métivier; an
d putting his f
ingers to his li
ps he hastened a
way.  Through 
the study door c
ame the sound of
 slippered feet 
and the cry: �
"�Spies, traitors"
", traitors every"
where! Not a mom
ent’s peace in
 my own house!�
��  After Mét
ivier’s depart
ure the old prin
ce called his da
"ughter in, and
"
the whole weight
 of his wrath fe
ll on her. She w
as to blame that
 a spy had been
 admitted. Had h
"e not told her, "
"yes, told her to"
" make a list,
a"
nd not to admit 
anyone who was n
ot on that list?
 Then why was th
at scoundrel ad
mitted? She was 
the cause of it 
"all. With her, h"
"e said, he
coul"
d not have a mom
ent’s peace an
d could not die 
quietly.  “N
"o, ma’am! We m"
"ust part, we mus"
t part! Understa
"nd that, underst"
and it! I canno
t endure any mor
"e,” he said, a"
nd left the room
". Then, as if
a"
fraid she might 
find some means 
"of consolation, "
he returned and 
trying to appea
r calm added: �
�And don’t ima
gine I have said
 this in a mome
nt of anger. I a
m calm. I have t
"hought it over, "
and it will be 
carried out—we
 must part; so f
ind some place f
or yourself....�
�� But he could
 not restrain hi
mself and with t
he virulence of 
which only one 
who loves is cap
"able, evidently "
suffering himsel
"f, he shook his "
fists at her an
d screamed:  �
��If only some f
ool would marry 
her!” Then he 
slammed the door
", sent
for Made"
moiselle Bourien
"ne, and subsided"
 into his study.
  At two o’c
lock the six cho
sen guests assem
bled for dinner.
  These guests
—the famous Co
"unt Rostopchín,"
 Prince Lopukhí
n with his neph
"ew, General Chat"
róv an old war 
comrade of the p
"rince’s, and
"
of the younger g
eneration Pierre
 and Borís Drub
etskóy—awaite
d the prince in
 the drawing roo
"m.

Borís, wh"
o had come to Mo
scow on leave a 
"few days before,"
 had been anxio
us to be present
ed to Prince Nic
holas Bolkónski
", and had contri"
ved to ingratia
te himself so we
ll that the old 
prince in his ca
se made an exce
ption to the rul
e of not receivi
ng bachelors in 
his house.  Th
e prince’s hou
se did not belon
g to what is kno
wn as fashionabl
"e
society, but "
his little circl
e—though not m
uch talked about
 in town—was 
one it was more 
flattering to be
 received in tha
n any other. Bo
rís had realize
d this the week 
before when the 
commander in chi
ef in his prese
nce invited Rost
opchín to dinne
r on St. Nichola
"s’ Day, and
R"
ostopchín had r
eplied that he c
ould not come: 
 “On that day
 I always go to 
pay my devotions
 to the relics o
f Prince Nichol
as Bolkónski.�
"�

“Oh, yes,"
 yes!” replied
 the commander i
n chief. “How 
is he?...”  
The small group 
that assembled b
efore dinner in 
the lofty old-fa
shioned drawing
 room with its o
ld furniture res
embled the solem
n gathering of 
a court of justi
ce. All were sil
ent or talked in
 low tones. Prin
ce Nicholas cam
e in serious and
 taciturn. Princ
ess Mary seemed 
even quieter an
d more diffident
 than usual. The
 guests were rel
uctant to addres
"s
her, feeling "
that she was in 
no mood for thei
r conversation. 
Count Rostopch�
�n alone kept th
e conversation g
"oing, now relati"
ng the latest t
"own news, and no"
w the latest pol
itical gossip. 
 Lopukhín and 
the old general 
occasionally too
k part in the c
onversation. Pri
nce Bolkónski l
istened as a pre
siding judge rec
"eives a
report,"
 only now and th
"en, silently or "
"by a brief word,"
 showing that h
e took heed of w
hat was being re
ported to him. T
he tone of the 
conversation was
 such as indicat
ed that no one a
pproved of what 
was being done 
in the political
 world. Incident
s were related e
vidently confir
ming the opinion
 that everything
 was going from 
"bad to worse, bu"
t whether telli
ng a story or gi
ving an opinion 
the speaker alwa
"ys stopped,
or "
"was stopped, at "
the point beyond
 which his criti
cism might touch
 the sovereign 
himself.  At d
inner the talk t
urned on the lat
est political ne
ws: Napoleon’s
 seizure of the
 Duke of Oldenbu
rg’s territory
", and the Russia"
"n Note,
hostile"
" to Napoleon, wh"
ich had been sen
t to all the Eur
opean courts.  
 “Bonaparte tr
eats Europe as a
 pirate does a c
"aptured vessel,�"
�� said Count R
"ostopchín, repe"
ating a phrase h
e had uttered se
veral times bef
ore. “One only
 wonders at the 
long-suffering o
r blindness of t
he crowned head
s. Now the Pope�
��s turn has com
e and Bonaparte 
doesn’t scrup
le to depose the
 head of the Cat
holic Church—y
et all keep sile
nt! Our soverei
gn alone has pro
tested against t
he seizure of th
e Duke of Olden
burg’s territo
"ry, and even...�"
�� Count Rostopc
"hín paused,
fe"
eling that he ha
d reached the li
mit beyond which
 censure was im
possible.  “
Other territorie
s have been offe
red in exchange 
for the Duchy of
"
Oldenburg,” "
said Prince Bolk
ónski. “He sh
ifts the Dukes a
bout as I might
 move my serfs f
rom Bald Hills t
o Boguchárovo o
r my Ryazán es
tates.”  “
The Duke of Olde
nburg bears his 
misfortunes with
 admirable stre
ngth of characte
r and resignatio
"n,” remarked B"
"orís, joining i"
n respectfully.
  He said this
 because on his 
journey from Pet
ersburg he had h
ad the honor of
 being presented
 to the Duke. Pr
ince Bolkónski 
glanced at the 
young man as if 
about to say som
"ething in reply,"
 but changed his
" mind,
evidentl"
y considering hi
m too young.  
“I have read o
ur protests abou
t the Oldenburg 
affair and was s
urprised how ba
dly the Note was
" worded,” rema"
rked Count Rosto
pchín in the c
asual tone of a 
man dealing with
 a subject quite
 familiar to him
.  Pierre look
ed at Rostopchí
n with naïve as
"tonishment, not "
understanding w
hy he should be 
disturbed by the
 bad composition
 of the Note.  
 “Does it matt
"er, Count, how t"
he Note is worde
"d,” he asked, "
“so long as i
ts substance is 
forcible?”  
“My dear fello
"w, with our five"
 hundred thousan
d troops it shou
ld be easy to h
ave a good style
",” returned Co"
unt Rostopchín.
  Pierre now u
nderstood the co
unt’s dissatis
faction with the
 wording of the
 Note.  “One
 would have thou
ght quill driver
s enough had spr
"ung up,”
rema"
rked the old pri
nce. “There in
 Petersburg they
 are always wri
ting—not notes
 only but even n
ew laws. My Andr
ew there has wri
tten a whole vo
lume of laws for
 Russia. Nowaday
s they are alway
s writing!” a
nd he laughed un
naturally.  Th
ere was a moment
ary pause in the
 conversation; t
he old general c
leared his thro
at to draw atten
tion.  “Did 
you hear of the 
last event at th
e review in Pete
rsburg? The fig
ure cut by the n
ew French ambass
ador.”  “E
"h? Yes, I heard "
something: he sa
id something awk
ward in His Maj
esty’s presenc
e.”  “His 
Majesty drew att
ention to the Gr
enadier division
 and to the marc
"h
past,” cont"
inued the genera
"l, “and it see"
ms the ambassado
r took no notic
e and allowed hi
mself to reply t
hat: ‘We in Fr
ance pay no att
ention to such t
rifles!’ The E
mperor did not c
ondescend to rep
ly. At the next
" review, they sa"
"y, the Emperor d"
id not once deig
n to address hi
m.”  All wer
e silent. On thi
s fact relating 
to the Emperor p
"ersonally, it wa"
s impossible to
 pass any judgme
nt.  “Impude
nt fellows!” s
aid the prince. 
“You know Mét
ivier? I turned 
 him out of my h
ouse this mornin
g. He was here; 
they admitted hi
m in spite of m
y request that t
hey should let n
"o one in,” he "
"went on,
glanci"
ng angrily at hi
s daughter.  A
nd he narrated h
is whole convers
ation with the F
rench doctor and
 the reasons th
at convinced him
 that Métivier 
was a spy. Thoug
h these reasons
 were very insuf
ficient and obsc
"ure, no one made"
 any rejoinder. 
  After the roa
"st, champagne wa"
s served. The gu
ests rose to con
gratulate the o
ld prince. Princ
"ess Mary, too, w"
ent round to him
.  He gave her
" a cold, angry l"
ook and offered 
her his wrinkled
",
clean-shaven "
cheek to kiss. T
he whole express
ion of his face 
told her that h
e had not forgot
ten the morning�
"��s talk, that h"
is decision rem
"ained in force, "
and only the pre
sence of visitor
s hindered his 
speaking of it t
o her now.  Wh
en they went int
o the drawing ro
om where coffee 
"was served, the "
old men sat tog
ether.  Prince
 Nicholas grew m
ore animated and
 expressed his v
iews on the imp
ending war.  H
e said that our 
wars with Bonapa
rte would be dis
astrous so long 
as we sought al
liances with the
 Germans and thr
ust ourselves in
to European aff
"airs, into which"
 we had been dra
wn by the Peace 
of Tilsit. “We
 ought not to f
ight either for 
or against Austr
ia. Our politica
l interests are
 all in the East
", and in regard "
to Bonaparte the
 only thing is 
to have an armed
 frontier and a 
"firm policy, and"
 he will never d
are to cross th
e Russian fronti
"er, as was the c"
ase in 1807!” 
  “How can we
 fight the Frenc
"h, Prince?” sa"
id Count Rostopc
hín. “Can we
 arm ourselves a
gainst our teach
ers and diviniti
es? Look at our
" youths, look at"
 our ladies! The
 French are our 
Gods: Paris is o
ur Kingdom of H
eaven.”  He 
began speaking l
"ouder, evidently"
 to be heard by 
everyone.  “
"French dresses, "
"French ideas, Fr"
ench feelings! T
"here now, you tu"
rned Métivier 
out by the scruf
f of his neck be
cause he is a Fr
enchman and a s
"coundrel, but ou"
r ladies crawl a
fter him on thei
r knees. I went 
to a party last
" night, and ther"
e out of five la
dies three were 
Roman Catholics
 and had the Pop
e’s indulgence
 for doing woolw
ork on Sundays. 
 And they themse
lves sit there n
"early naked, lik"
e the signboards
 at our Public 
Baths if I may s
"ay so. Ah, when "
one looks at our
" young people,
"
"Prince, one woul"
d like to take P
eter the Great�
�s old cudgel ou
t of the museum
 and belabor the
m in the Russian
 way till all th
e nonsense jumps
 out of them.�
�  All were si
lent. The old pr
ince looked at R
ostopchín with 
a smile and wag
ged his head app
rovingly.  “
"Well, good-by, y"
"our excellency, "
keep well!” sa
"id Rostopchín,"
 getting up with
 characteristic 
briskness and ho
lding out his ha
nd to the princ
e.  “Good-by
", my dear fellow"
.... His words a
"re music, I neve"
r tire of heari
ng him!” said 
"the old prince, "
keeping hold of 
the hand and of
fering his cheek
 to be kissed. 
 Following Rost
opchín’s exam
ple the others a
lso rose.    
   CHAPTER IV 
  Princess Mary
 as she sat list
ening to the old
 men’s talk an
"d
faultfinding,"
 understood noth
ing of what she 
heard; she only 
wondered whethe
r the guests had
 all observed he
r father’s hos
tile attitude t
oward her. She d
id not even noti
ce the special a
ttentions and a
miabilities show
n her during din
ner by Borís Dr
"ubetskóy, who w"
as visiting the
m for the third 
time already.  
 Princess Mary t
urned with absen
t-minded questio
ning look to Pie
"rre, who
hat in"
 hand and with a
 smile on his fa
ce was the last 
of the guests to
 approach her a
fter the old pri
nce had gone out
 and they were l
eft alone in th
e drawing room. 
  “May I stay
 a little longer
"?” he said, le"
tting his stout 
body sink into 
an armchair besi
de her.  “Oh
" yes,” she ans"
wered. “You no
ticed nothing?�
� her look asked
.  Pierre was 
in an agreeable 
after-dinner moo
d. He looked str
aight before hi
m and smiled qui
etly.  “Have
 you known that 
"young man long, "
Princess?” he 
asked.  “Who
?”  “Drube
tskóy.”  �
"�No, not long..."
.”  “Do yo
u like him?” 
"
“Yes, he is "
an agreeable you
ng man.... Why d
o you ask me tha
t?” said Prin
"cess Mary, still"
 thinking of tha
t morning’s co
nversation with 
her father.  
“Because I hav
e noticed that w
hen a young man 
comes on leave f
rom Petersburg 
to Moscow it is 
usually with the
 object of marry
ing an heiress.
”  “You ha
ve observed that
?” said Prince
ss Mary.  “Y
"es,” returned "
Pierre with a sm
"ile, “and this"
 young man now 
manages matters 
so that where th
ere is a wealthy
 heiress there h
e is too. I can
 read him like a
 book. At presen
t he is hesitati
ng whom to lay 
siege to—you o
r Mademoiselle J
ulie Karágina. 
He is very atten
tive to her.”
  “He visits
 them?”  “
"Yes, very often."
 And do you know
 the new way of 
courting?” sai
d Pierre with a
"n amused smile, "
evidently in tha
t cheerful mood 
of good humored
 raillery for wh
ich he so often 
reproached himse
lf in his diary.
"

“No,” re"
plied Princess M
ary.  “To pl
ease Moscow girl
s nowadays one h
as to be melanch
oly. He is very 
 melancholy with
 Mademoiselle Ka
"rágina,” said"
 Pierre.  “R
eally?” asked 
"Princess Mary, l"
ooking into Pier
re’s kindly f
ace and still th
inking of her ow
n sorrow. “It 
would be a relie
"f,”
thought s"
"he, “if I vent"
ured to confide 
what I am feelin
g to someone. I
 should like to 
tell everything 
to Pierre. He is
 kind and genero
us. It would be
 a relief. He wo
uld give me advi
ce.”  “Wou
ld you marry him
"?”

“Oh, m"
"y God, Count, th"
ere are moments 
when I would mar
ry anybody!” 
she cried sudden
ly to her own su
rprise and with 
tears in her voi
"ce.
“Ah, how "
bitter it is to 
love someone nea
r to you and to 
feel that...”
 she went on in 
a trembling voic
"e, “that you c"
an do nothing f
or him but griev
"e him, and to kn"
ow that you cann
ot alter this. T
hen there is on
ly one thing lef
"t—to go away, "
but where could 
I go?”  “W
hat is wrong? Wh

thout finishing 
what she was say

ry burst into t
ears.  “I do
n’t know what 
is the matter wi
th me today. Don
’t take any n
otice—forget w
hat I have said!
”  Pierre’
s gaiety vanishe
d completely. He
 anxiously quest
ioned the princ
"ess, asked her t"
o speak out full
y and confide he
r grief to him; 
but she only re
peated that she 
begged him to fo
rget what she ha
"d said, that
sh"
e did not rememb
er what she had 
"said, and that s"
he had no troubl
e except the on
e he knew of—t
hat Prince Andre
w’s marriage t
hreatened to ca
use a rupture be
tween father and
 son.  “Have
 you any news of
 the Rostóvs?�
"� she asked, to "
change the subj

so expecting And
rew any day. I 
should like them
 to meet here.�
�  “And how 
does he now rega

"� asked Pierre, "
referring to th
e old prince.  
 Princess Mary s
hook her head. 
 “What is to 
be done? In a fe
w months the yea

"hem a long time,"
” said Princes
s Mary. “Tell 
me honestly the
 whole truth: wh
at sort of girl 
"is she, and what"
 do you think of
 her?—The rea
"l truth, because"
 you know Andrew
 is risking so m
uch doing this 
against his fath
er’s will that
 I should like t
o know....”  
 An undefined in
stinct told Pier
re that these ex
"planations, and"
 repeated reques
ts to be told th
"e whole truth, e"
xpressed ill-wil
l on the prince
ss’ part towar
d her future sis
ter-in-law and a
 wish that he s
hould disapprove
 of Andrew’s c
hoice; but in re
ply he said what
 he felt rather
 than what he th
ought.  “I d
on’t know how 
to answer your q
"uestion,” he s"
"aid, blushing
w"
ithout knowing w
hy. “I really 
don’t know wha
t sort of girl s
he is; I can’
t analyze her at
 all. She is enc
"hanting, but wha"
t makes her so I
 don’t know. 
That is all one 
can say about he
r.”  Princes
"s Mary sighed, a"
nd the expressio
n on her face sa
"id: “Yes,
tha"
t’s what I exp
ected and feared
.”  “Is sh
e clever?” she
 asked.  Pierr
e considered.  
"
“I think not,"
"” he said, “"
and yet—yes. S
he does not deig
n to be clever.
"... Oh no, she i"
s simply enchant

 all.”  Prin
cess Mary again 
shook her head d
isapprovingly. 
"
“Ah, I so lo"
ng to like her! 
Tell her so if y
ou see her befor
e I do.”  �
�I hear they are
 expected very s
"oon,” said Pie"

 Mary told Pierr
e of her plan to
 become intimate
 with her future

as soon as the R

and to try to ac

prince to her. 
     CHAPTE
R V  Borís ha
d not succeeded 
in making a weal
thy match in Pet
"ersburg, so
wit"
h the same objec
t in view he cam
e to Moscow. The
re he wavered be
tween the two r
ichest heiresses
", Julie and Prin"
cess Mary. Thoug
h Princess Mary
 despite her pla
inness seemed to
 him more attrac
"tive than Julie,"
" he,
without kn"
"owing why, felt "
awkward about pa
ying court to he
r. When they ha
d last met on th
e old prince’s
" name day, she h"
ad answered at r
andom all his a
ttempts to talk 
"sentimentally, e"
vidently not lis
tening to what 
he was saying. 
 Julie on the c
ontrary accepted
 his attentions 
"readily, though "
in a manner pec
uliar to herself
.  She was twe
nty-seven. After
 the death of he
r brothers she h
ad become very 
wealthy. She was
 by now decidedl
"y plain, but tho"
ught herself not
 merely as good
-looking as befo
re but even far 
more attractive.
 She was confir
med in this delu
sion by the fact
 that she had be
come a very wea
lthy heiress and
 also by the fac
t that the older
 she grew the le
ss dangerous sh
"e became to men,"
 and the more fr
eely they could 
associate with 
her and avail th
emselves of her 
"suppers, soirees"
", and the animat"
ed company that
 assembled at he
"r house, without"
 incurring any o
bligation. A ma
n who would have
 been afraid ten
 years before of
 going every day
 to the house w
hen there was a 
girl of seventee
"n there, for fea"
r of compromisi
ng her and commi
"tting himself, w"
ould now go bold
ly every day an
d treat her not 
as a marriageabl
e girl but as a 
sexless acquaint
ance.  That wi
nter the Karági
ns’ house was 
the most agreeab
le and hospitabl
e in Moscow. In
 addition to the
 formal evening 
and dinner parti
"es, a large
com"
"pany, chiefly of"
" men, gathered t"
"here every day, "
supping at midni
ght and staying
 till three in t
he morning. Juli
e never missed a
" ball, a
promen"
"ade, or a play. "
Her dresses were
 always of the l
atest fashion. 
But in spite of 
that she seemed 
to be disillusio
ned about everyt
hing and told e
veryone that she
 did not believe
 either in frien
dship or in love
",
or any of the"
" joys of life, a"
nd expected peac
e only “yonder
.” She adopte
d the tone of on
e who has suffer
ed a great disap
"pointment, like "
a girl who has 
either lost the 
man she loved or
 been cruelly de
ceived by him. 
Though nothing o
f the kind had h
appened to her s
he was regarded 
"in
that light, "
and had even her
self come to bel
ieve that she ha
d suffered much
 in life. This m
"elancholy, which"
 did not prevent
 her amusing he
"rself, did not h"
inder the young 
people who came 
to her house fro
m passing the t
ime pleasantly. 
Every visitor wh
o came to the ho
use paid his tr
ibute to the mel
ancholy mood of 
"the hostess, and"
 then amused hi
mself with socie
"ty gossip, danci"
"ng, intellectual"
" games, and bout"
"s
rimés, which"
 were in vogue a
t the Karágins�
��. Only a few o
f these young m
"en, among them B"
"orís, entered m"
ore deeply into 
Julie’s melan
"choly, and with "
these she had pr
olonged conversa
tions in private
 on the vanity 
of all worldly t
"hings, and to th"
em she showed he
r albums filled
 with mournful s
"ketches, maxims,"
 and verses.  
"To Borís, Julie"
 was particularl
y gracious: she 
regretted his ea
rly disillusion
"ment with life, "
offered him such
 consolation of 
friendship as s
he who had herse
lf suffered so m
uch could render
", and showed him"
 her album. Bor
ís sketched two
 trees in the al
bum and wrote: �
"��Rustic
trees,"
 your dark branc
hes shed gloom a
nd melancholy up
on me.”  On 
another page he 
"drew a tomb, and"
 wrote:      L
a mort est secou
rable et la mort
 est tranquille.
     Ah! contre
 les douleurs il
 n’y a pas d�
�autre asile. * 
      * Death g
ives relief and 
death is peacefu
l.       Ah! fr
om suffering the
re is no other r
efuge.  Julie 
said this was ch
arming  “The
re is something 
so enchanting in
 the smile of me
"lancholy,” she"
 said to Borís
", repeating word"
 for word a pass
age she had copi
ed from a book.
 “It is a ray 
of light in the 
"darkness, a shad"
e between sadnes
"s
and despair, "
showing the poss
ibility of conso
lation.”  In
 reply Borís wr
ote these lines:
      Aliment 
de poison d’un
e âme trop sens
"ible,
    Toi, "
sans qui le bonh
eur me serait im
"possible,
    T"

"my retreat,

  And mingle a s

      With these

el to be flowing
".

For Borís,"
 Julie played mo
st doleful noctu
rnes on her harp
. Borís read P
oor Liza aloud t
"o her, and more "
than once interr
upted the readin
g because of th
e emotions that 
choked him. Meet
ing at large gat
herings Julie a
nd Borís looked
 on one another 
as the only soul
s who understood
 one another in
 a world of indi
fferent people. 
  Anna Mikháyl
"ovna, who often "
visited the Kar�
"�gins, while pla"
ying cards with
 the mother made
 careful inquiri
es as to Julie�
�s dowry (she wa
s to have two e
states in Pénza
 and the Nizheg�
�rod forests). A
nna Mikháylovn
a regarded the r
efined sadness t
hat united her s
on to the wealt
hy Julie with em
"otion, and resig"
nation to the Di
vine will.  �
�You are always 
charming and mel
"ancholy, my dear"
" Julie,” she s"
aid to the daug
hter. “Borís 
says his soul fi
nds repose at yo
ur house. He has
 suffered so ma
ny disappointmen
ts and is so sen
"sitive,” said "
she to the moth
"er. “Ah, my de"
"ar, I can’t te"
ll you how fond 
I have grown of
" Julie latterly,"
” she said to 
her son. “But 
who could help l
oving her? She 
is an angelic be
"ing! Ah, Borís,"
 Borís!”—sh
e paused. “An
d how I pity her
" mother,” she "
went on; “toda
y she showed me 
her accounts an
d letters from P
énza (they have
 enormous estate
"s there), and
s"
"he, poor thing, "
has no one to he
"lp her, and they"
 do cheat her so
!”  Borís s
miled almost imp
erceptibly while
 listening to hi
s mother. He la
ughed blandly at
 her naïve dipl
omacy but listen
ed to what she h
"ad
to say, and "
sometimes questi
oned her careful
ly about the Pé
nza and Nizheg�
�rod estates.  
 Julie had long 
been expecting a
 proposal from h
er melancholy ad
orer and was re
ady to accept it
; but some secre
t feeling of rep
"ulsion for her,"
 for her passion
ate desire to ge
"t married, for h"
er artificiality
", and
a feeling"
 of horror at re
nouncing the pos
sibility of real
 love still res
trained Borís. 
His leave was ex
piring. He spent
 every day and w
hole days at th
"e Karágins’, "
and every day on
 thinking the ma
tter over told 
himself that he 
would propose to
morrow. But in J
ulie’s presenc
"e,
looking at h"
er red face and 
chin (nearly alw
"ays powdered), h"
"er moist
eyes, "
and her expressi
on of continual 
readiness to pas
s at once from 
melancholy to an
 unnatural raptu
re of married bl
"iss, Borís coul"
d not utter the
" decisive words,"
 though in imagi
nation he had lo
ng regarded him
self as the poss
essor of those P
énza and Nizheg
órod estates an
d had apportion
ed the use of th
e income from th
em. Julie saw Bo
rís’ indecis
"ion, and sometim"
es the thought o
ccurred to her t
hat she was rep
"ulsive to him, b"
ut her feminine 
self-deception i
mmediately suppl
ied her with co
"nsolation, and s"
he told herself 
that he was only
 shy from love.
" Her melancholy,"
" however, began "
to turn to irrit
"ability, and not"
 long before Bo
rís’ departur
e she formed a d
efinite plan of 
action. Just as
 Borís’ leave
 of absence was 
"expiring, Anatol"
e Kurágin made 
 his appearance 
"in Moscow, and o"
f course in the 
Karágins’ dra
"wing
room, and "
"Julie, suddenly "
abandoning her m
"elancholy, becam"
e cheerful and 
very attentive t
o Kurágin.  �
"��My dear,” sa"
id Anna Mikháyl
"ovna to her son,"
 “I know from 
a reliable sour
ce that Prince V
asíli has sent 
his son to Mosco
w to get him ma
rried to Julie. 
I am so fond of 
Julie that I sho
uld be sorry for
 her. What do y

za estates which
 he had already 
mentally apport
ioned and put to
 proper use fall
 into the hands 
"of another, and"
 especially into
 the hands of th
at idiot Anatole
", pained Borís."
 He drove to th
e Karágins’ w
ith the firm int
ention of propos
ing. Julie met 
"him in a gay, ca"
"reless manner, s"
poke casually of
 how she had enj
oyed yesterday�
"��s ball, and as"
ked when he was 
leaving. Though 
Borís had come
 intentionally t
o speak of his l
ove and therefor
e meant to be t
"ender, he began "
speaking irritab
ly of feminine i
"nconstancy, of h"
ow easily women
 can turn from s
"adness to joy, a"
nd how their moo
ds depend solel
y on who happens
 to be paying co
urt to them. Jul
ie was offended 
and replied tha
t it was true th
at a woman needs
" variety, and th"
e same thing ov
er and over agai
n would weary an
yone.  “Then
 I should advise
 you...” Borí
"s began, wishing"
 to sting her; 
but at that inst
ant the galling 
thought occurred
 to him that he 
might have to l
eave Moscow with
out having accom
"plished his aim,"
 and have vainl
y wasted his eff
orts—which was
 a thing he neve
r allowed to ha
ppen.  He chec
ked himself in t
he middle of the
" sentence, lower"
ed his eyes to 
avoid seeing her
 unpleasantly ir
ritated and irre
"solute face, and"
 said:  “I d
id not come here
 at all to quarr
el with you. On 
the contrary...�
��  He glanced
 at her to make 
sure that he mig
ht go on. Her ir
ritability had 
suddenly quite v
"anished, and her"
" anxious, implor"
ing eyes were fi
xed on him with
 greedy expectat
ion. “I can al
ways arrange so 
as not to see h
"er often,” tho"
ught Borís. “
The affair has b
een begun and mu
st be finished!
” He blushed h
"otly, raised his"
" eyes to hers, a"
nd said:  “Y
ou know my feeli
ngs for you!” 
  There was no 
need to say more
: Julie’s face
 shone with triu
mph and self-sa
tisfaction; but 
she forced Borí
s to say all tha
t is said on suc
h occasions—t
hat he loved her
 and had never l
oved any other w
oman more than 
her. She knew th
at for the Pénz
a estates and Ni
zhegórod forest
s she could dem
"and this, and sh"
e received what 
she demanded.  
 The affianced c
"ouple, no longer"
 alluding to tre
es that shed glo
om and melancho
"ly upon them, pl"
anned the arrang
ements of a sple
ndid house in P

"calls, and prepa"
red everything f
or a brilliant w
edding.     
  CHAPTER VI  
 At the end of J
anuary old Count
 Rostóv went to
 Moscow with Nat
ásha and Sóny
a. The countess 
was still unwell
 and unable to t
ravel but it was
 impossible to 
wait for her rec
overy. Prince An
drew was expecte
d in Moscow any
" day, the trouss"
eau had to be or
dered and the es
tate near Mosco
w had to be sold
", besides which "
the opportunity 
of presenting hi
s future daught
er-in-law to old
 Prince Bolkóns
ki while he was 
in Moscow could
 not be missed. 
The Rostóvs’ 
Moscow house had
 not been heated
 that winter an
"d, as they had c"
ome only for a s
hort time and th
e countess was 
"not with them, t"
he count decided
 to stay with M�
�rya Dmítrievna
"
Akhrosímova, "
who had long bee
n pressing her h
ospitality on th
em.  Late one 
evening the Rost
óvs’ four sle
ighs drove into 
Márya Dmítrie
vna’s courtyar
d in the old Kon
yúsheny street.
 Márya Dmítri
evna lived alone
. She had alread
y married off he
"r daughter, and"
 her sons were a
ll in the servic
e.  She held h
"erself as erect,"
 told everyone h
er opinion as ca
"ndidly,
loudly,"
 and bluntly as 
"ever, and her wh"
ole bearing seem
ed a reproach t
o others for any
" weakness, passi"
"on, or temptatio"
n—the possibil
ity of which sh
e did not admit.
 From early in t
"he morning, wear"
ing a dressing 
"jacket, she atte"
nded to her hous
"ehold affairs, a"
nd then she drov
e out: on holy 
days to church a
nd after the ser
vice to jails an
d prisons on af
fairs of which s
he never spoke t
o anyone. On ord
"inary days, afte"
"r
dressing, she"
 received petiti
oners of various
" classes, of who"
m there were al
ways some. Then 
"she had dinner, "
a substantial an
d appetizing mea
l at which ther
e were always th
ree or four gues
ts; after dinner
 she played a g
"ame of boston, a"
nd at night she 
had the newspape
rs or a new book
 read to her wh
ile she knitted.
 She rarely made
 an exception an
d went out to p
"ay visits, and t"
hen only to the 
most important p
ersons in the to
wn.  She had n
ot yet gone to b
ed when the Rost
óvs arrived and
 the pulley of 
the hall door sq
ueaked from the 
cold as it let i
n the Rostóvs a
nd their servan
ts. Márya Dmít
"rievna, with her"
 spectacles hang
ing down on her 
 nose and her he
"ad flung back, s"
tood in the hall
 doorway looking
" with
a stern, "
grim face at the
 new arrivals. O
ne might have th
ought she was a
ngry with the tr
avelers and woul
d immediately tu
"rn them out, had"
 she not at the
 same time been 
giving careful i
nstructions to t
he servants for
 the accommodati
on of the visito
rs and their bel
ongings.  “T
he count’s thi
ngs? Bring them 
"here,” she sai"
"d, pointing to t"
he portmanteaus
 and not greetin
g anyone. “The
 young ladies’
? There to the 
left. Now what a
re you dawdling 
for?” she crie
d to the maids. 
 “Get the samo
var ready!... Yo
u’ve grown plu
mper and prettie
"r,” she
remar"
"ked, drawing Nat"
ásha (whose che
eks were glowing
 from the cold) 
 to her by the h
ood. “Foo! You
 are cold! Now t
ake off your thi
"ngs,
quick!” "
she shouted to t
he count who was
 going to kiss h
er hand. “You
’re half froze
"n, I’m sure! B"
ring some rum fo
r tea!... Bonjou
"r,
Sónya dear!"
"” she added, t"
urning to Sónya
 and indicating 
by this French 
greeting her sli
ghtly contemptuo
us though affect
ionate attitude 
 toward her.  
When they came i
"n to tea, having"
 taken off their
 outdoor things 
and tidied them
selves up after 
"their journey, M"
árya Dmítrievn
a kissed them a
ll in due order.
  “I’m hea
rtily glad you h
ave come and are
 staying with me
. It was high t
"ime,” she said"
", giving Natásh"
a a significant 
look. “The old
 man is here an
d his son’s ex
pected any day. 
You’ll have to
 make his acqua
intance. But we�
��ll speak of th
"at later on,” "
"she added, glanc"
ing at Sónya w
ith a look that 
showed she did n
ot want to speak
 of it in her p
resence. “Now 
"listen,” she s"
aid to the count
. “What do you
 want tomorrow?
 Whom will you s
end for? Shinsh�
�n?” she crook
ed one of her f
ingers. “The s
niveling Anna Mi
kháylovna? That
’s two. She’
s here with her
 son. The son is
 getting married
! Then Bezúkhov
", eh? He is here"
"
too, with his "
wife. He ran awa
y from her and s
he came gallopin

 dined with me o
n Wednesday. As

d she pointed to
 the girls—�
�tomorrow I’ll
 take them first
 to the Iberian 
shrine of the M

d then we’ll d
rive to the Supe
r-Rogue’s. I 
suppose you’ll
 have everything
 new. Don’t ju
dge by me: sleev
es nowadays are
 this size! The 
other day young 
Princess Irína 
Vasílevna came
 to see me; she 
was an awful sig
ht—looked as i
f she had put tw
o barrels on he
r arms. You know
 not a day passe
s now without so
me new fashion.
... And what hav
e you to do your
self?” she ask
ed the count st
ernly.  “One
 thing has come 
on top of anothe
r: her rags to b
"uy, and now a
p"
urchaser has tur
ned up for the M
oscow estate and
 for the house. 
If you will be 
"so kind, I’ll "
fix a time and g
o down to the es
tate just for a 
"
day, and leave "
my lassies with 
you.”  “Al
l right. All rig

s safe as in Ch

ake them where t
"hey must go, sco"

nd pet them a b
"it,” said Már"
"ya Dmítrievna, "
touching her god
daughter and fa
"vorite, Natásha"
", on the cheek w"
ith her large ha
nd.  Next morn
ing Márya Dmít
rievna took the 
young ladies to 
the Iberian shr
ine of the Mothe
r of God and to 
Madame Suppert-R
"oguet, who was s"
o afraid of Má
rya Dmítrievna 
that she always 
let her have cos
tumes at a loss
 merely to get r
id of her. Máry
a Dmítrievna or
dered almost the
 whole troussea
u. When they got
 home she turned
 everybody out o
f the room exce
"pt Natásha, and"
 then called her
 pet to her armc
hair.  “Well

lk. I congratula
te you on your b
etrothed. You�
�ve hooked a fin

 She held her ha

lushed happily. 
“I like him an
d all his family

 Prince Nicholas

.”  Natásha
 remained silent
", from shyness M"
árya Dmítrievn
"a supposed, but"
 really because 
she disliked any
one interfering 
in what touched 
her love of Pri

HAPTER VII  Ne
"xt day, by Máry"
a Dmítrievna’
"s advice, Count "
Rostóv took Nat
ásha to call o
n Prince Nichola
s Bolkónski. Th
e count did not 
set out cheerfu
lly on this visi
"t, at heart he f"
elt afraid. He w
ell remembered 
the last intervi
ew he had had wi
th the old princ
e at the time of
 the enrollment
", when in reply "
to an invitation
 to dinner he ha
d had to listen
 to an angry rep
rimand for not h
aving provided h
is full quota of
"
men. Natásha,"
 on the other ha
"nd, having put o"
"n her best gown,"
 was in the hig
hest spirits. �
�They can’t he
"lp liking me,”"
 she thought. �
��Everybody alwa
"ys has liked me,"
 and I am so wil
ling to do anyth
"ing
they wish, "
so ready to be f
ond of him—for
 being his fathe
r—and of her�
��for being his 
sister—that th
ere is no reason
 for them not to
 like me....”
  They drove u
p to the gloomy 
old house on the
 Vozdvízhenka a
nd entered the 
vestibule.  �
"�Well, the Lord "
have mercy on us
!” said the co
"unt, half in jes"
"t,
half in earn"
est; but Natásh
a noticed that h
er father was fl
urried on enter
ing the anteroom
 and inquired ti
midly and softly
 whether the pri
nce and princes
s were at home. 
  When they had
 been announced 
a perturbation w
as noticeable am
ong the servant
s. The footman w
ho had gone to a
nnounce them was
 stopped by ano
ther in the larg
e hall and they 
whispered to one
 another. Then a
 maidservant ra
n into the hall 
and hurriedly sa
"id something, me"
ntioning the pr
incess. At last 
"an old, cross lo"
oking footman ca
me and announced
 to the Rostóv
s that the princ
e was not receiv
"ing, but that th"
e princess begg
ed them to walk 
up. The first pe
rson who came to
 meet the visito
rs was Mademois
elle Bourienne. 
She greeted the 
father and daugh
ter with specia
l politeness and
 showed them to 
the princess’ 
room. The princ
"ess, looking exc"
ited and nervous
", her face flush"
"ed in patches, r"
an in to meet t
"he visitors, tre"
"ading heavily, a"
nd vainly trying
 to appear cord
ial and at ease.
 From the first 
glance Princess 
Mary did not lik
e Natásha. She
 thought her too
 fashionably dre
"ssed, frivolousl"
y gay and vain.
 She did not at 
all realize that
 before having s
een her future 
sister-in-law sh
e was prejudiced
 against her by 
involuntary envy
" of her
beauty,"
" youth, and happ"
"iness, as well a"
s by jealousy of
 her brother’s
 love for her. 
Apart from this 
insuperable anti
"pathy to her, Pr"
incess Mary was
 agitated just t
hen because on t
he Rostóvs’ b
"eing announced,"
 the old prince 
had shouted that
 he did not wish
" to see them, th"
at Princess Mar
y might do so if
" she chose, but "
they were not to
 be admitted to
 him. She had de
cided to receive
" them, but feare"
d lest the princ
e might at any 
moment indulge i
"n some freak, as"
 he seemed much 
upset by the Ro
stóvs’ visit.
"

“There, my"
" dear princess, "
I’ve brought y
ou my songstress
",” said
the c"
"ount, bowing and"
 looking round u
neasily as if af
raid the old pri
nce might appea
r. “I am so gl
ad you should ge
t to know one an
other... very s
orry the prince 
"is still ailing,"
” and after a 
few more commonp
lace remarks he
 rose. “If you
’ll allow me t
o leave my Natá
sha in your han
ds for a quarter
" of an hour, Pri"
"ncess, I’ll dr"
ive round to see
 Anna Semënovn
"a, it’s quite "
near in the Dogs
"’ Square, and "
then I’ll com
e back for her.�
��  The count 
had devised this
 diplomatic ruse
 (as he afterwar
ds told his dau
ghter) to give t
he future sister
s-in-law an oppo
rtunity to talk 
 to one another 
"freely, but anot"
her motive was t
o avoid the dang
er of encounter
ing the old prin
"ce, of whom he w"
as afraid. He di
d not mention t
his to his daugh
"ter, but Natásh"
a noticed her fa
ther’s nervous
ness and anxiet
y and felt morti
fied by it. She 
"blushed for him,"
 grew still ang
rier at having b
"lushed, and look"
ed at the prince
ss with a bold a
nd defiant expr
ession which sai
d that she was n
ot afraid of any
body. The princ
ess told the cou
nt that she woul
"d be delighted, "
and only begged 
him to stay lon
ger at Anna Sem�
"�novna’s, and "
he departed.  
Despite the unea
sy glances throw
n at her by Prin
cess Mary—who 
wished to have 
a tête-à-tête
 with Natásha�
�Mademoiselle Bo
urienne remaine
d in the room an
d persistently t
alked about Mosc
ow amusements an
d theaters. Nat
ásha felt offen
ded by the hesit
ation she had no
ticed in the an
"teroom, by her f"
ather’s nervou
"sness, and by th"
e unnatural mann
er of the princ
ess who—she th
ought—was maki
ng a favor of re
"ceiving her,
an"
d so everything 
displeased her. 
She did not like
" Princess Mary, "
whom she though
"t very plain, af"
"fected, and dry."
 Natásha sudden
ly shrank into 
herself and invo
luntarily assume
d an offhand air
 which alienated
 Princess Mary 
still more. Afte
r five minutes o
"f irksome, const"
rained conversa
"tion, they heard"
 the sound of sl
ippered feet rap
idly approachin
g. Princess Mary
 looked frighten
ed.  The door 
opened and the o
"ld prince, in a "
dressing gown an
d a white night
"cap, came in.
"
"
“Ah, madam!�"
� he began. “M
"adam, Countess.."

beg you to excus

"epeated,
stress"
ing the word “
God” so unnatu
rally and so unp
leasantly that 
Princess Mary st
ood with downcas
t eyes not darin
g to look either
 at her father 
or at Natásha. 
  Nor did the l
"atter, having ri"
sen and curtsied
", know what to d"
o. Mademoiselle
 Bourienne alone
 smiled agreeabl
y.  “I beg y
"ou to excuse me,"
 excuse me! God 
"is my witness, I"
" did not
know,�"
�� muttered the 
"old man, and aft"
er looking Natá
sha over from he
ad to foot he w
ent out.  Made
moiselle Bourien
ne was the first
 to recover hers
elf after this 
apparition and b
egan speaking ab
out the prince�
�s indisposition
. Natásha and 
Princess Mary lo
oked at one anot
"her in silence, "
and the longer 
they did so with
out saying what 
they wanted to s
"ay, the greater"
 grew their anti
pathy to one ano
ther.  When th
e count returned
", Natásha was i"
mpolitely please
d and hastened 
to get away: at 
that moment she 
"hated the stiff,"
 elderly princes
"s, who
could pl"
ace her in such 
an embarrassing 
position and had
 spent half an 
hour with her wi
thout once menti
oning Prince And
rew. “I couldn
’t begin talk
ing about him in
 the presence of
 that Frenchwoma
"n,” thought
N"
atásha. The sam
e thought was me
anwhile tormenti
ng Princess Mary
. She knew what
 she ought to ha
ve said to Natá
"sha, but she had"
 been unable to
 say it because 
Mademoiselle Bou
rienne was in th
"e way, and becau"
"se,
without kno"
"wing why, she fe"
lt it very diffi
cult to speak of
 the marriage. 
When the count w
as already leavi
"ng the room, Pri"
ncess Mary went
 up hurriedly to
" Natásha, took "
"her by the hand,"
 and said with a
 deep sigh:  
"“Wait, I must."
..”  Natásh
a glanced at her
 ironically with
out knowing why.
  “Dear Nata
"lie,” said Pri"
"ncess Mary, “I"
 want you to kno
w that I am gla
d my brother has
 found happiness
....”  She p
"aused, feeling t"
hat she was not 
telling the trut
h. Natásha noti
ced this and gu
essed its reason
".

“I think,"
" Princess, it is"
 not convenient 
to speak of that
" now,”
she sa"
id with external
 dignity and col
"dness, though sh"
e felt the tears
 choking her. 
 “What have I
 said and what h
ave I done?” t
"hought she, as s"
oon as she was 
out of the room.
  They waited 
a long time for 
Natásha to come
 to dinner that 
day. She sat in
 her room crying
" like a child, b"
lowing her nose 
and sobbing. Só
nya stood besid
"e her, kissing h"
er hair.  “N
"atásha, what is"
 it about?” sh
e asked. “What
 do they matter 
to you? It will
" all pass, Natá"
sha.”  “Bu
t if you only kn
ew how offensive
 it was... as if
 I...”  “D
on’t talk abou
"t it, Natásha. "
It wasn’t your
 fault so why sh
ould you mind? 
"Kiss me,” said"
 Sónya.  Nat�
�sha raised her 
"head and, kissin"
g her friend on 
"the lips, presse"
d her wet face 
against her.  
“I can’t tel
"l you, I don’t"
 know. No one’
"s to blame,” s"
aid Natásha—
“It’s my fau
lt. But it all h
urts terribly. O
"h, why
doesn’"
t he come?...”
  She came in 
to dinner with r
ed eyes. Márya 
"Dmítrievna, who"
 knew how the p
rince had receiv
"ed the Rostóvs,"
 pretended not t
o notice how ups
et Natásha was
 and jested reso
lutely and loudl
y at table with 
the count and t
he other guests.
      CHAP
TER VIII  That
 evening the Ros
tóvs went to th
"e Opera, for whi"
ch Márya Dmít
rievna had taken
 a box.  Natá
sha did not want
" to go, but coul"
d not refuse Má
rya Dmítrievna�
��s kind offer 
which was intend
ed expressly for
 her. When she c
ame ready dress
ed into the ball
room to await he
"r father, and lo"
oking in the lar
ge mirror there
 saw that she wa
"s pretty, very p"
"retty, she felt "
"even more
sad, "
but it was a swe
"et, tender sadne"
"ss.

“O God,"
 if he were here
 now I would not
 behave as I did
" then, but
diff"
erently. I would
 not be silly an
d afraid of thin
"gs, I would simp"
"ly
embrace him,"
" cling to him, a"
nd make him look
 at me with thos
e searching inq
uiring eyes with
 which he has so
 often looked at
" me, and then I"
 would make him 
laugh as he used
 to laugh. And h
is eyes—how I 
see those eyes!
” thought Nat�
�sha. “And wha
t do his father 
and sister matte
r to me? I love
" him alone, him,"
" him, with that "
face and those e
"yes, with
his s"
"mile, manly and "
yet childlike...
". No, I had bett"
er not think of 
 him; not think 
of him but forge
"t him, quite for"
get him for the 
present. I can�
��t bear this wa
iting and I shal
l cry in a minut
e!” and she t
urned away from 
"the glass, makin"
g an effort not 
to cry. “And h
ow can Sónya l
ove Nicholas so 
calmly and quiet
ly and wait so l
ong and so pati
ently?” though
"t she, looking a"
"t Sónya, who al"
so came in quite
"
ready, with a "
fan in her hand.
" “No, she’s "
altogether diffe
rent. I can’t
!”  Natásha
 at that moment 
felt so softened
 and tender that
 it was not eno
ugh for her to l
ove and know she
" was beloved, sh"
"e wanted now, at"
"
once, to embra"
ce the man she l
"oved, to speak a"
nd hear from him
 words of love 
such as filled h
er heart. While 
she sat in the c
arriage beside h
"er
father, pens"
ively watching t
he lights of the
 street lamps fl
ickering on the
" frozen window, "
she felt still s
adder and more i
"n love, and forg"
ot where she wa
s going and with
 whom. Having fa
llen into the li
ne of carriages
", the Rostóvs�"
� carriage drove
 up to the theat
"er, its wheels
"
squeaking over t
he snow. Natásh
"a and Sónya, ho"
lding up their d
"resses,
jumped "
out quickly. The
 count got out h
elped by the foo
"tmen, and,
pass"
ing among men an
d women who were
 entering and th
e program seller
"s,
they all thr"
ee went along th
e corridor to th
e first row of b
oxes. Through t
he closed doors 
the music was al
ready audible. 
"
“Natásha, y"
our hair!...” 
whispered Sónya
.  An attendan
t deferentially 
and quickly slip
ped before the l
adies and opene
d the door of th
eir box. The mus
ic sounded loude
r and through th
e door rows of 
brightly lit box
es in which ladi
es sat with bare
 arms and shoul
"ders, and noisy "
stalls brilliant
" with uniforms, "
glittered before
 their eyes. A 
lady entering th
e next box shot 
a glance of femi
nine envy at Na
tásha. The curt
ain had not yet 
risen and the ov
erture was being
 played. Natás
"ha, smoothing he"
"r gown, went in "
with Sónya and 
"sat down,
scann"
ing the brillian
t tiers of boxes
 opposite. A sen
sation she had n
ot experienced 
for a long time�
��that of hundre
ds of eyes looki
ng at her bare 
arms and neck—
suddenly affecte
d her both agree
ably and disagr
eeably and calle
d up a whole cro
"wd of memories, "
desires and emo
tions associated
 with that feeli
ng.  The two r
emarkably pretty
" girls, Natásha"
" and Sónya, wit"
h Count Rostóv 
 who had not bee
n seen in Moscow
 for a long time
", attracted gene"
ral attention. 
"Moreover, everyb"
ody knew vaguely
 of Natásha’s
 engagement to 
"Prince Andrew, a"
nd knew that the
 Rostóvs had li
ved in the count
"ry
ever since, "
and all looked w
ith curiosity at
 a fiancée who 
was making one 
of the best matc
hes in Russia. 
 Natásha’s l
"ooks, as everyon"
"e told her, had "
improved in the 
"country,
and th"
at evening thank
s to her agitati
on she was parti
cularly pretty. 
 She struck thos
e who saw her by
 her fullness of
 life and beauty
",
combined with"
 her indifferenc
e to everything 
about her. Her b
lack eyes looke
d at the crowd w
ithout seeking a
"nyone, and her d"
"elicate arm, bar"
e to above the 
"elbow, lay on th"
e velvet edge of
" the box, while,"
 evidently unco
"nsciously, she o"
pened and closed
 her hand in tim
"e to the music,"
 crumpling her p
"rogram. “Look,"
 there’s Alén
"ina,” said Só"
"nya,
“with he"
"r mother, isn’"
t it?”  “D
"ear me, Michael "
Kirílovich has 
grown still stou
ter!” remarked
 the count.  
“Look at our A
nna Mikháylovna
—what a headdr
ess she has on!�
��  “The Kar
"ágins, Julie—"
and Borís with 
them. One can se
e at once that 
they’re engage
d....”  “D
rubetskóy has p
roposed?”  �
"��Oh yes, I hear"
"d it today,” s"
"aid Shinshín, c"
oming into the 
Rostóvs’ box.
  Natásha loo
ked in the direc
tion in which he
r father’s eye
s were turned a
nd saw Julie sit
ting beside her 
mother with a ha
ppy look on her 
 face and a stri
ng of pearls rou
nd her thick red
 neck—which Na
tásha knew was
 covered with po
wder. Behind the
"m, wearing a smi"
le and leaning 
over with an ear
 to Julie’s mo
"uth, was Borís�"
�� handsome smoo
thly brushed he
ad. He looked at
 the Rostóvs fr
om under his bro
ws and said som
"ething, smiling,"
 to his betrothe
d.  “They ar
e talking about 
"us, about me and"
 him!” thought
 Natásha. “A
nd he no doubt i
s calming her je
alousy of me. Th
ey needn’t tro
uble themselves
! If only they k
new how little I
 am concerned ab
out any of them
.”  Behind t
hem sat Anna Mik
háylovna wearin
g a green headdr
ess and with a 
happy look of re
signation to the
 will of God on 
her face. Their 
box was pervade
d by that atmosp
here of an affia
nced couple whic
h Natásha knew 
 so well and lik
ed so much. She 
turned away and 
suddenly remembe
red all that ha
d been so humili
ating in her mor
ning’s visit. 
  “What right
 has he not to w
ish to receive m
e into his famil
"y? Oh,
better n"
ot think of it�
�not till he com
es back!” she 
"told herself,
a"
nd began looking
" at the faces, s"
ome strange and 
"some familiar, i"
n the stalls. I
"n the front, in "
"the very center,"
 leaning back ag
ainst the orche
"stra rail, stood"
 Dólokhov in a 
"Persian dress, h"
is curly hair b
rushed up into a
 huge shock. He 
stood in full vi
ew of the audien
"ce,
well aware "
that he was attr
acting everyone�
"��s attention, y"
et as much at e
ase as though he
 were in his own
 room. Around hi
m thronged Mosco
w’s most bril
"liant young men,"
 whom he evident
ly dominated.  
"
The count, laug"
"hing, nudged the"
 blushing Sónya
 and pointed to 
her former ador
er.  “Do you
 recognize him?�
�� said he. “A
nd where has he 
sprung from?” 
"
he asked, turni"
ng to Shinshín.
 “Didn’t he 
vanish somewhere
?”  “He di
"d,” replied Sh"
inshín. “He w
as in the Caucas
us and ran away
 from there. The
y say he has bee
n acting as mini
ster to some rul
ing prince in P
"ersia, where he "
killed the Shah�
��s brother. Now
 all the Moscow
 ladies are mad 
about him! It’
s ‘Dólokhov t

at does it! We 
never hear a wor

is mentioned. Th
ey swear by him
", they offer him"
 to you as they 
would a dish of 
choice sterlet. 
 Dólokhov and A
natole Kurágin 
have turned all 
our ladies’ he
ads.”  A tal
"l, beautiful wom"
an with a mass o
f plaited hair a
nd much exposed 
 plump white sho
"ulders and neck,"
 round which she
 wore a double s
tring of large 
"pearls, entered "
the adjoining bo
x rustling her h
eavy silk dress 
 and took a long
 time settling i
nto her place. 
 Natásha invol
untarily gazed a
"t that neck, tho"
"se shoulders, an"
d pearls and co
"iffure, and admi"
red the beauty o
f the shoulders 
and the pearls. 
 While Natásha 
was fixing her g
aze on her for t
he second time t
he lady looked 
"round and, meeti"
ng the count’s
" eyes, nodded to"
 him and smiled.
 She was the Co
untess Bezúkhov

d spoke to her. 
  “Have you b

nquired. “I’

Is he here?” 
"
“Yes, he mea"
"nt to look in,�"
� answered Hél�
"�ne, and glanced"
 attentively at
 Natásha.  Co
unt Rostóv resu
med his seat.  
"
“Handsome, is"
n’t she?” he
 whispered to Na
tásha.  “Wo
nderful!” answ
ered Natásha. �
��She’s a woma
n one could easi
ly fall in love
 with.”  Jus
t then the last 
chords of the ov
erture were hear
d and the conduc
tor tapped with
 his stick. Some
 latecomers took
 their seats in 
"the stalls,
and"
 the curtain ros
e.  As soon as
 it rose everyon
e in the boxes a
nd stalls became
" silent, and
al"
"l the men, old a"
"nd young, in uni"
form and evening
" dress, and all "
the women with 
gems on their ba
"re flesh, turned"
 their whole att
ention with eag
er curiosity to 
the stage. Natá
sha too began to
 look at it.  
    CHAPTER 
IX  The floor 
of the stage con
sisted of smooth
" boards, at the "
sides was some 
painted cardboar
d representing t
"rees, and at the"
 back was a clot
h stretched ove
r boards. In the
 center of the s
tage sat some gi
rls in red bodi
ces and white sk
irts. One very f
at girl in a whi
te silk dress sa
t apart on a lo
"w bench, to the "
back of which a 
piece of green c
ardboard was gl
ued. They all sa
ng something. Wh
en they had fini
shed their song 
 the girl in whi
te went up to th
e prompter’s b
ox and a man wit
h tight silk tr
ousers over his 
"stout legs, and "
holding a plume 
"and a dagger,
w"
ent up to her an
"d began singing,"
 waving his arms
 about.  First
 the man in the 
tight trousers s
"ang alone, then "
"she sang, then t"
hey both paused
 while the orche
stra played and 
the man fingered
 the hand of th
"e girl in white,"
 obviously await
ing the beat to 
start singing wi
th her. They sa
ng together and 
everyone in the 
theater began cl
apping and shou
"ting, while the "
man and woman on
 the stage—who
 represented lo
vers—began smi
"ling, spreading "
"out their arms, "
and bowing.  A
fter her life in
" the country, an"
d in her present
" serious mood, a"
ll this seemed 
grotesque and am
azing to Natásh
a. She could not
 follow the oper
a nor even list
en to the music;
 she saw only th
e painted cardbo
ard and the que
erly dressed men
 and women who m
"oved, spoke, and"
 sang so strange
ly in that bril
liant light. She
 knew what it wa
s all meant to r
"epresent, but
i"
t was so pretent
iously false and
 unnatural that 
she first felt a
shamed for the 
actors and then 
amused at them. 
She looked at th
e faces of the 
"audience, seekin"
g in them the sa
me sense of ridi
cule and perplex
ity she herself
" experienced, bu"
t they all seeme
d attentive to w
hat was happenin
"g
on the stage,"
 and expressed d
elight which to 
Natásha seemed 
feigned. “I s
uppose it has to
 be like this!�
� she thought. S
he kept looking 
 round in turn a
t the rows of po
maded heads in t
he stalls and th
en at the semin
ude women in the
" boxes, especial"
ly at Hélène i
"n the next box,"
 who—apparentl
y quite unclothe
d—sat with a q
uiet tranquil sm
"ile, not
taking"
 her eyes off th
e stage. And fee
ling the bright 
light that flood
ed the whole pl
ace and the warm
 air heated by t
"he crowd, Natás"
ha little by li
ttle began to pa
ss into a state 
of intoxication 
she had not exp
erienced for a l
ong while. She d
id not realize w
ho and where she
"
was, nor what "
was going on bef
ore her. As she 
looked and thoug
"ht, the
strange"
st fancies unexp
ectedly and disc
onnectedly passe
d through her m
ind: the idea oc
curred to her of
 jumping onto th
e edge of the bo
x and singing t
he aria the actr
"ess was singing,"
 then she wished
 to touch with 
her fan an old g
entleman sitting
 not far from he
"r, then to lean "
over to Hélèn
e and tickle her
.  At a moment
 when all was qu
iet before the c
ommencement of a
" song, a door
l"
eading to the st
alls on the side
 nearest the Ros
tóvs’ box cre
"aked,
and the s"
teps of a belate
d arrival were h
eard. “There�
�s Kurágin!” 
 whispered Shins
hín. Countess B
ezúkhova turned
 smiling to the 
"newcomer,
and N"
"atásha, followi"
ng the direction
" of that look, s"
aw an exceptiona
lly handsome ad
jutant approachi
ng their box wit
h a self-assured
 yet courteous 
bearing. This wa
s Anatole Kurág
in whom she had 
seen and notice
d long ago at th
e ball in Peters
burg. He was now
 in an adjutant
’s uniform wit
h one epaulet an
d a shoulder kno
t. He moved with
 a restrained s
wagger which wou
ld have been rid
iculous had he n
ot been so good
-looking and had
 his handsome fa
ce not worn such
 an expression 
of good-humored 
complacency and 
gaiety. Though t
he performance w
"as
proceeding, "
he walked delibe
rately down the 
carpeted gangway
", his sword
and"
 spurs slightly 
jingling and his
 handsome perfum
ed head held hig
h. Having looke
d at Natásha he
 approached his 
"sister, laid his"
 well gloved ha
nd on the edge o
"f her box, nodde"
"d to her, and le"
aning forward as
"ked a
question,"
 with a motion t
oward Natásha. 
  “Mais charm
ante!” said he
", evidently refe"
rring to Natásh
"a, who did
not "
exactly hear his
 words but under
stood them from 
the movement of 
his lips. Then 
he took his plac
e in the first r
ow of the stalls
 and sat down b
"eside Dólokhov,"
 nudging with hi
s elbow in a fri
endly and offhan
d way that Dól
okhov whom other
s treated so faw
ningly. He winke
"d at him gaily,"
"
smiled, and res"
ted his foot aga
inst the orchest
ra screen.  �
�How like the br
other is to the 
"sister,” remar"
ked the count. �
��And how hands
ome they both ar
e!”  Shinsh�
"�n, lowering his"
" voice, began to"
 tell the count 
of some intrigue
 of Kurágin’
"s in Moscow, and"
 Natásha tried 
to overhear it j
ust because he 
had said she was
 “charmante.�
�  The first a
ct was over. In 
the stalls every
one began moving
" about, going
o"
ut and coming in
.  Borís came
 to the Rostóvs
"’ box, receive"
d their congratu
lations very si
"mply, and raisin"
g his eyebrows w
ith an absent-mi
nded smile conve
yed to Natásha
 and Sónya his 
fiancée’s inv
itation to her w
"edding, and
wen"
t away. Natásha
" with a gay, coq"
uettish smile ta
"lked to him, and"
 congratulated 
on his approachi
ng wedding that 
same Borís with
 whom she had f
ormerly been in 
love. In the sta
te of intoxicati
"on she was in,
"
everything seeme
d simple and nat
ural.  The sca
ntily clad Hél�
�ne smiled at ev
eryone in the sa
"me way, and
Nat"
ásha gave Borí
s a similar smil
e.  Hélène�
�s box was fille
d and surrounded
 from the stalls
 by the most di
stinguished and 
intellectual men
", who seemed to "
vie with one ano
ther in their w
ish to let every
one see that the
y knew her.  D
uring the whole 
of that entr’a
cte Kurágin sto
od with Dólokho
v in front of t
he orchestra par
"tition, looking "
at the Rostóvs�
�� box. Natásh
a knew he was ta
lking about her 
and this afforde
d her pleasure. 
 She even turned
 so that he shou
ld see her profi
le in what she t
hought was its 
most becoming as
pect. Before the
 beginning of th
e second act Pi
erre appeared in
 the stalls. The
 Rostóvs had no
t seen him since
 their arrival.
 His face looked
" sad, and he had"
 grown still sto
uter since Nat�
�sha last saw hi
m. He passed up 
to the front row
"s, not noticing"
 anyone. Anatole
 went up to him 
and began speaki
"ng to him, looki"
ng at and indic
ating the Rostó
vs’ box. On se
eing Natásha Pi
erre grew animat
"ed
and, hastily"
 passing between
" the rows, came "
toward their box
. When he got t
here he leaned o
n his elbows and
", smiling, talke"
d to her for a l
ong time. While
 conversing with
" Pierre, Natásh"
a heard a man’
s voice in Coun
tess Bezúkhova�
��s box and some
thing told her i
t was Kurágin. 
She turned and 
their eyes met. 
"Almost smiling, "
he gazed straigh
t into her eyes
 with such an en
raptured caressi
ng look that it 
seemed strange t
o be so near hi
"m, to look at hi"
"m like that, to "
be so sure he ad
"mired her, and
"
not to be acquai
nted with him. 
 In the second 
act there was sc
enery representi
"ng tombstones, t"
here was a roun
d hole in the ca
nvas to represen
"t the moon, shad"
es were raised o
ver the footlig
"hts, and from ho"
rns and contraba
ss came deep not
es while many p
eople appeared f
rom right and le
ft wearing black
 cloaks and hold
ing things like
 daggers in thei
r hands. They be
gan waving their
 arms. Then som
e other people r
an in and began 
dragging away th
e maiden who had
 been in white 
and was now in l
ight blue. They 
did not drag her
" away at once,
"
but sang with he
r for a long tim
e and then at la
st dragged her o
"ff, and
behind "
the scenes somet
hing metallic wa
s struck three t
imes and everyo
ne knelt down an
d sang a prayer.
 All these thing
s were repeatedl
y interrupted b
y the enthusiast
ic shouts of the
 audience.  Du
ring this act ev
ery time Natásh
a looked toward 
the stalls she s
aw Anatole Kur�
�gin with an arm
 thrown across t
he back of his c
"hair,
staring a"
t her. She was p
leased to see th
at he was captiv
ated by her and 
 it did not occu
r to her that th
ere was anything
 wrong in it.  
 When the second
 act was over Co
untess Bezúkhov
"a rose, turned t"
o the Rostóvs�
�� box—her who
le bosom complet
ely exposed—be
ckoned the old 
count with a glo
"ved finger, and "
paying no attent
ion to those who
 had entered he
r box began talk
ing to him with 
an amiable smile
.  “Do make 
me acquainted wi
th your charming
" daughters,” s"
aid she. “The
 whole town is s
inging their pra
ises and I don�
�t even know th
em!”  Natás
ha rose and curt
sied to the sple
ndid countess. S
he was so please
d by praise fro
m this brilliant
 beauty that she
 blushed with pl
easure.  “I 
want to become a
" Moscovite too, "
"now,” said Hé"
lène. “How is
 it you’re no
t ashamed to bur
y such pearls in
 the country?”
  Countess Bez
úkhova quite de
served her reput
ation of being a
 fascinating wo
man. She could s
ay what she did 
not think—espe
cially what was 
 flattering—qu
ite simply and n
aturally.  “
"Dear count, you "
must let me look
 after your daug
hters! Though I 
am not staying 
here long this t
ime—nor are yo
u—I will try t
o amuse them. I
 have already he
ard much of you 
in Petersburg an
d wanted to get 
"
to know you,”"
 said she to Nat
ásha with her s
tereotyped and l
ovely smile. �
�I had heard abo
ut you from my p
"age, Drubetskóy"
. Have you hear
d he is getting 
married? And als
o from my husban
d’s friend Bo
"lkónski, Prince"
 Andrew Bolkóns
"ki,” she went "
on with special 
"
emphasis, imply"
ing that she kne
w of his relatio
n to Natásha. T
o get better ac
quainted she ask
ed that one of t
he young ladies 
should come int
o her box for th
e rest of the pe
"rformance, and N"
atásha moved ov
er to it.  Th
e scene of the t
hird act represe
nted a palace in
 which many cand
les were burnin
g and pictures o
f knights with s
hort beards hung
 on the walls. 
In the middle st
ood what were pr
obably a king an
d a queen. The 
king waved his r
"ight arm and, ev"
"idently nervous,"
 sang something 
badly and sat d
own on a crimson
 throne. The mai
den who had been
 first in white 
 and then in lig
"ht blue, now wor"
"e only a smock, "
and stood beside
 the throne wit
h her hair down.
 She sang someth
"ing mournfully, "
addressing the 
"queen, but the k"
ing waved his ar
"m severely, and "
men and women wi
th bare legs ca
me in from both 
sides and began 
dancing all toge
ther. Then the 
violins played v
ery shrilly and 
merrily and one 
of the women wit
h thick bare le
gs and thin arms
", separating fro"
"m the others, we"
nt behind the w
"ings, adjusted h"
"er bodice, retur"
ned to the middl
"e of the stage, "
and began jumpi
ng and striking 
one foot rapidly
 against the oth
er. In the stal
ls everyone clap
ped and shouted 
“bravo!” The
n one of the men
 went into a co
rner of the stag
e. The cymbals a
nd horns in the 
orchestra struc
k up more loudly
", and this man w"
ith bare legs ju
mped very high a
nd waved his fe
et about very ra
pidly. (He was D
"uport, who recei"
ved sixty thous
and rubles a yea
r for this art.)
 Everybody in th
"e stalls, boxes,"
 and galleries 
began clapping a
nd shouting with
 all their might
", and the
man s"
topped and began
 smiling and bow
ing to all sides
. Then other men
 and women danc
ed with bare leg
s. Then the king
 again shouted t
o the sound of 
"music, and they "
all began singin
g. But suddenly 
a storm came on
", chromatic scal"
es and diminishe
d sevenths were 
heard in the or
"chestra, everyon"
"e ran off, again"
 dragging one of
 their number aw
"ay,
and the cur"
tain dropped. On
ce more there wa
s a terrible noi
se and clatter 
among the audien
"ce, and with rap"
turous faces eve
ryone began sho
uting: “Duport
! Duport! Duport
!” Natásha no
 longer thought 
this strange. S
he looked about 
"with pleasure, s"
miling joyfully.
  “Isn’t D
uport delightful
?” Hélène as
ked her.  “O
"h, yes,” repli"
ed Natásha.  
    CHAPTER 
X  During the 
entr’acte a wh
iff of cold air 
came into Hélè
"ne’s box,
the"
" door opened, an"
d Anatole entere
"d, stooping and "
trying not to br
ush against any
one.  “Let m
e introduce my b
"rother to you,�"
"� said Hélène,"
 her eyes shift
ing uneasily fro
m Natásha to An
atole.  Natás
ha turned her pr
etty little head
 toward the eleg
ant young office
r and smiled at
 him over her ba
re shoulder. Ana
"tole, who was as"
 handsome at cl
ose quarters as 
"at a distance, s"
at down beside h
er and told her 
he had long wis
hed to have this
 happiness—eve
r since the Nar�
�shkins’ ball
" in fact, at whi"
ch he had had th
e well-remembere
d pleasure of se
eing her. Kurá
gin was much mor
e sensible and s
imple with women
 than among men
. He talked bold
ly and naturally
", and Natásha w"
as strangely and
 agreeably stru
ck by the fact t
hat there was no
thing formidable
 in this man ab
out whom there w
"as so much talk,"
 but that on the
 contrary his s
mile was most na
"ïve, cheerful, "
and good-natured
.  Kurágin as
ked her opinion 
of the performan
ce and told her 
how at a previo
us performance S
emënova had fal
len down on the 
stage.  “And
" do you know, Co"
"untess,” he sa"
"id, suddenly add"
ressing her as a
"n
old, familiar"
" acquaintance, �"
��we are getting
 up a costume to
urnament; you o
ught to take par
t in it! It will
 be great fun. W
e shall all meet
 at the Karági
ns’! Please co
"me! No! Really, "
eh?” said he. 
  While saying 
this he never re
moved his smilin
g eyes from her 
"face,
her neck,"
 and her bare ar
ms. Natásha kne
w for certain th
at he was enrap
tured by her. Th
"is pleased her, "
yet his presence
 made her feel 
constrained and 
oppressed. When 
she was not look
ing at him she f
elt that he was
 looking at her 
"shoulders, and s"
he involuntarily
 caught his eye 
 so that he shou
ld look into her
s rather than th
is. But looking 
into his eyes s
he was frightene
"d, realizing tha"
t there was not 
that barrier of 
 modesty she had
 always felt bet
ween herself and
 other men. She 
did not know ho
w it was that wi
thin five minute
s she had come t
o feel herself 
terribly near to
 this man. When 
she turned away 
she feared he mi
ght seize her f
rom behind by he
r bare arm and k
iss her on the n
eck. They spoke
 of most ordinar
"y things, yet sh"
e felt that they
 were closer to 
 one another tha
n she had ever b
een to any man. 
Natásha kept tu
rning to Hélè
ne and to her fa
"ther, as if aski"
ng what it all m
"eant, but Hélè"
ne was engaged 
in conversation 
with a general a
nd did not answe
"r her
look, and"
 her father’s 
eyes said nothin
g but what they 
always said: �
�Having a good t
"ime? Well, I’m"
 glad of it!” 
  During one of
 these moments o
f awkward silenc
e when Anatole�
�s prominent ey
es were gazing c
almly and fixedl
"y at her, Natás"
"ha, to break
th"
"e silence, asked"
 him how he like
d Moscow. She as
ked the question
 and blushed. S
he felt all the 
time that by tal
king to him she 
was doing somet
hing improper. A
natole smiled as
 though to encou
rage her.  “
At first I did n
"ot like it much,"
 because what ma
kes a town pleas
ant ce sont les
" jolies femmes, "
* isn’t that s
o? But now I lik
e it very much 
"indeed,” he sa"
"id, looking at h"
er significantly
. “You’ll co
me to the costu
"me tournament, C"
ountess? Do come
!” and putting
 out his hand t
o her bouquet an
d dropping his v
"oice, he added, "
“You will be t
he prettiest th
"ere. Do come, de"
"ar countess, and"
 give me this fl
ower as a pledg
e!”      * A
re the pretty wo
men.  Natásha
 did not underst
and what he was 
saying any more 
than he did him
"self, but she fe"
lt that his inco
mprehensible wor
ds had an improp
er intention. S
he did not know 
what to say and 
turned away as i
f she had not h
eard his remark.
 But as soon as 
she had turned a
way she felt tha
"t
he was there,"
" behind, so clos"
e behind her.  
 “How is he no
w? Confused? Ang
ry? Ought I to p
ut it right?” 
she asked herse
"lf, and she coul"
d not refrain fr
om turning round
. She looked st
raight into his 
"eyes, and his ne"
"arness, self-ass"
"urance, and the"
 good-natured te
nderness of his 
smile vanquished
 her. She smiled
 just as he was
" doing, gazing s"
traight into his
 eyes. And again
 she felt with 
horror that no b
arrier lay betwe
en him and her. 
  The curtain r
ose again. Anato
"le left the box,"
 serene and gay.
 Natásha went 
back to her fath
er in the other 
"box, now quite s"
ubmissive to the
 world she foun
d herself in. Al
l that was going
 on before her n
ow seemed quite
" natural, but on"
 the other hand 
all her previous
 thoughts of her
"
betrothed, of "
"Princess Mary, o"
r of life in the
 country did not
 once recur to 
her mind and wer
e as if belongin
g to a remote pa
st.  In the fo
urth act there w
as some sort of 
devil who sang w
aving his arm a
"bout, till the b"
oards were withd
rawn from under 
him and he disap
peared down bel
ow. That was the
 only part of th
e fourth act tha
t Natásha saw. 
 She felt agitat
ed and tormented
", and the cause "
of this was Kur�
�gin whom she c
ould not help wa
tching. As they 
were leaving the
 theater Anatole
 came up to the
"m, called their "
"carriage, and he"
lped them in. As
 he was putting
 Natásha in he 
pressed her arm 
above the elbow.
 Agitated and f
lushed she turne
d round. He was 
looking at her w
ith glittering e
"yes,
smiling te"
nderly.   Onl
y after she had 
reached home was
 Natásha able c
learly to think 
over what had h
"appened to her, "
and suddenly rem
embering Prince 
Andrew she was 
"horrified, and a"
t tea to which a
ll had sat down 
"after the opera,"
 she gave a lou
"d exclamation, f"
"lushed, and ran "
out of the room.
  “O God! I 
am lost!” she 
said to herself.
 “How could I 
let him?” She
 sat for a long 
time hiding her 
flushed face in 
her hands trying
 to realize wha
t had happened t
"o her, but was u"
nable either to 
understand what
 had happened or
 what she felt. 
Everything seeme
"d dark, obscure,"
 and terrible. 
There in that en
"ormous, illumina"
ted theater wher
e the bare-legg
"ed Duport, in a "
tinsel-decorated
" jacket, jumped "
about to the mu
sic on wet board
"s, and young gir"
"ls and old men, "
and the nearly 
naked Hélène w
"ith her proud, c"
"alm smile, raptu"
rously cried �
�bravo!”—the
re in the presen
ce of that Hél�
�ne it had all s
eemed clear and
 simple; but now
", alone by herse"
"lf, it was incom"
prehensible. �
�What is it? Wha
t was that terro
r I felt of him?
 What is this gn
awing of consci
ence I am feelin
g now?” she th
ought.  Only t
o the old counte
ss at night in b
ed could Natásh
a have told all 
 she was feeling
. She knew that 
Sónya with her 
severe and simpl
e views would e
ither not unders
tand it at all o
r would be horri
fied at such a 
confession. So N
atásha tried to
 solve what was 
torturing her by
 herself.  �
�Am I spoiled fo
r Andrew’s lov
e or not?” she
" asked herself, "
and with soothi
ng irony replied
: “What a fool
 I am to ask tha
t! What did hap
pen to me? Nothi
ng! I have done 
"nothing, I didn�"
��t lead him on 
 at all. Nobody 
will know and I 
shall never see 
"him again,” sh"
e told herself.
 “So it is pla
in that nothing 
has happened and
 there is nothi
"ng to repent of,"
 and Andrew can 
love me still. B
ut why ‘still?
"’
O God, why "
isn’t he here?
” Natásha qui
eted herself for
" a moment,
but "
again some insti
nct told her tha
t though all thi
"s was true, and"
 though nothing 
"had happened, ye"
t the former pur
ity of her love 
for Prince Andr
ew had perished.
 And again in im
agination she we
nt over her who
le conversation 
"with Kurágin, a"
nd again saw the
" face, gestures,"
 and tender smi
le of that bold 
handsome man whe
n he pressed her
 arm.      
 CHAPTER XI  A
natole Kurágin 
was staying in M
oscow because hi
s father had sen
t him away from
" Petersburg, whe"
re he had been s
pending twenty t
housand rubles 
"a year in cash, "
besides running 
up debts for as 
"much more, which"
 his creditors 
demanded from hi
s father.  His
 father announce
d to him that he
 would now pay h
alf his debts fo
r the last time
", but only on co"
ndition that he 
went to Moscow a
s adjutant to t
he commander in 
chief—a post h
is father had pr
ocured for him�
�and would at l
ast try to make 
a good match the
re. He indicated
 to him Princes
s Mary and Julie
 Karágina.  A
natole consented
 and went to Mos
"cow, where he pu"
t up at Pierre�
�s house. Pierr
e received him u
nwillingly at fi
"rst, but got use"
d to him after 
"a while, sometim"
es even accompan
ied him on his c
"arousals, and ga"
ve him money un
der the guise of
 loans.  As Sh
inshín had rema
"rked, from the t"
ime of his arriv
al Anatole had 
turned the heads
 of the Moscow l
"adies, especiall"
y by the fact th
at he slighted 
them and plainly
 preferred the g
ypsy girls and F
rench actresses
—with the chie
"f of whom, Madem"
"oiselle George, "
he was said to 
be on intimate r
elations. He had
 never missed a 
carousal at Dan�
�lov’s or oth
er Moscow revele
"rs’, drank who"
le nights throug
"h, outvying
eve"
"ryone else, and "
was at all the b
alls and parties
 of the best soc
iety. There was
 talk of his int
rigues with some
" of the ladies, "
and he flirted 
with a few of th
em at the balls.
 But he did not 
run after the un
"married
girls, "
especially the r
ich heiresses wh
o were most of t
hem plain. Ther
e was a special 
"reason for this,"
 as he had got m
arried two years
 before—a fac
t known only to 
his most intimat
e friends. At th
at time while w
ith his regiment
" in Poland, a Po"
lish landowner o
f small means ha
d forced him to
 marry his daugh
ter. Anatole had
 very soon aband
oned his wife a
"nd, for a paymen"
t which he agree
d to send to his
" father-in-law,"
 had arranged to
 be free to pass
 himself off as 
a bachelor.  A
natole was alway
s content with h
"is position, wit"
"h himself, and w"
ith others. He 
was instinctivel
y and thoroughly
 convinced that 
it was impossib
le for him to li
ve otherwise tha
n as he did and 
that he had nev
er in his life d
one anything bas
e. He was incapa
ble of consideri
ng how his acti
ons might affect
 others or what 
the consequences
 of this or tha
t action of his 
might be. He was
" convinced that,"
 as a duck is so
 made that it m
ust live in wate
"r, so God had ma"
de him such that
 he must spend 
thirty thousand 
rubles a year an
d always occupy 
a prominent posi
tion in society
. He believed th
is so firmly tha
"t others, lookin"
"g at him, were
"
persuaded of it 
too and did not 
refuse him eithe
r a leading plac
e in society or
" money, which he"
 borrowed from a
nyone and everyo
ne and evidentl
y would not repa
y.  He was not
" a gambler, at a"
ny rate he did n
ot care about wi
nning. He was n
ot vain. He did 
not mind what pe
ople thought of 
him. Still less 
could he be acc
used of ambition
. More than once
 he had vexed hi
s father by spo
iling his own ca
"reer, and he lau"
ghed at distinct
ions of all kind
s. He was not m
"ean, and did not"
 refuse anyone w
ho asked of him.
 All he cared a
bout was gaiety 
"and women, and a"
s according to h
is ideas there 
was nothing dish
onorable in thes
"e tastes, and he"
 was incapable o
f considering w
hat the gratific
ation of his tas
tes entailed for
" others,
he hon"
estly considered
 himself irrepro
"achable, sincere"
ly despised rogu
es and bad peop
"le, and with a t"
ranquil conscien
ce carried his h
ead high.  Rak
"es, those male M"
"agdalenes, have "
a secret feeling
 of innocence s
imilar to that w
hich female Magd
"alenes have, bas"
ed on the same h
ope of forgiven
ess. “All will
 be forgiven her
", for she loved "
much; and all w
ill be forgiven 
"him, for he enjo"
yed much.”  
"Dólokhov, who h"
ad reappeared th
at year in Mosco
w after his exil
e and his Persi
"an adventures, a"
nd was leading a
" life of luxury,"
" gambling, and
"
"dissipation, ass"
ociated with his
 old Petersburg 
comrade Kurágin
 and made use o
f him for his ow
n ends.  Anato
le was sincerely
 fond of Dólokh
ov for his cleve
rness and audac
"ity. Dólokhov, "
who needed Anato
le Kurágin’s 
"name, position, "
and connections
 as a bait to dr
aw rich young me
n into his gambl
"ing set, made
u"
se of him and am
used himself at 
his expense with
out letting the 
other feel it. 
Apart from the a
dvantage he deri
ved from Anatole
", the very
proc"
ess of dominatin
g another’s wi
ll was in itself
" a pleasure, a
"
"habit, and a nec"
essity to Dólok
hov.  Natásha
 had made a stro
ng impression on
 Kurágin. At su
pper after the 
opera he describ
ed to Dólokhov 
with the air of 
a connoisseur th
e attractions o
"f her arms, shou"
"lders, feet, and"
 hair and expres
sed his intenti
on of making lov

e had no notion 
and was incapabl
e of considerin
g what might com
e of such love-m
"aking, as he nev"
er had any noti

“You know, I "

 CHAPTER XII  
 The day after t
he opera the Ros
tóvs went nowhe
re and nobody ca
me to see them.
 Márya Dmítrie
vna talked to th
e count about so
mething which th
ey concealed fr
om Natásha. Nat
ásha guessed th
ey were talking 
about the old p
rince and planni
"ng something, an"
d this disquiete
d and offended h
er. She was exp
ecting Prince An
drew any moment 
and twice that d
ay sent a manse
rvant to the Voz
dvízhenka to as
certain whether 
he had come. He 
had not arrived
. She suffered m
ore now than dur
ing her first da
ys in Moscow. T
o her impatience
 and pining for 
him were now add
ed the unpleasan
t recollection 
of her interview
 with Princess M
ary and the old 
"prince,
and a f"
ear and anxiety 
of which she did
 not understand 
the cause. She 
continually fanc
ied that either 
he would never c
ome or that some
thing would hap
pen to her befor
e he came. She c
ould no longer t
hink of him by 
herself calmly a
nd continuously 
as she had done 
before. As soon 
as she began to
" think of him, t"
he recollection 
of the old princ
"e, of Princess
"
"Mary, of the the"
"ater, and of Kur"
ágin mingled wi
th her thoughts.
 The question a
gain presented i
tself whether sh
e was not guilty
", whether she
h"
ad not already b
roken faith with
" Prince Andrew, "
and again she fo
und herself rec
alling to the mi
nutest detail ev
"ery word, every "
"gesture, and
ev"
ery shade in the
 play of express
ion on the face 
of the man who h
ad been able to
 arouse in her s
uch an incompreh
ensible and terr
ifying feeling.
 To the family N
atásha seemed l
ivelier than usu
"al, but she was"
 far less tranqu
il and happy tha
n before.  On 
Sunday morning M
árya Dmítrievn
a invited her vi
sitors to Mass a
t her parish ch
urch—the Churc
h of the Assumpt
ion built over t
he graves of vi
ctims of the pla
gue.  “I don
’t like those 
fashionable chur
"ches,” she sai"
"d, evidently
pr"
iding herself on
 her independenc
e of thought. �
�God is the same
 everywhere. We
 have an excelle
"nt priest, he co"
nducts the servi
ce decently and
" with dignity, a"
nd the deacon is
 the same. What 
holiness is the
re in giving con
certs in the cho
ir? I don’t li
"ke it, it’s ju"
st self-indulge
nce!”  Máry
a Dmítrievna li
ked Sundays and 
knew how to keep
 them. Her whole
 house was scru
bbed and cleaned
 on Saturdays; n
either she nor t
he servants wor
"ked, and they al"
l wore holiday d
ress and went to
 church. At her
 table there wer
e extra dishes a
"t dinner, and th"
e servants had v
odka and roast 
goose or sucklin
g pig. But in no
thing in the hou
se was the holi
day so noticeabl
e as in Márya D
mítrievna’s b
"road, stern face"
",
which on that"
 day wore an inv
ariable look of 
solemn festivity
".

After Mass,"
 when they had f
inished their co
ffee in the dini
ng room where t
he loose covers 
had been removed
 from the furnit
"ure, a servant
"
announced that t
he carriage was 
"ready, and Máry"
a Dmítrievna ro
se with a stern
 air. She wore h
er holiday shawl
", in which she p"
"aid calls, and
"
announced that s
he was going to 
see Prince Nicho
las Bolkónski t
o have an expla
nation with him 
about Natásha. 
  After she had
" gone, a dressma"
ker from Madame 
Suppert-Roguet w
aited on the Ro
"stóvs, and Nat�"
"�sha, very glad "
of this diversio
"n, having shut
"
herself into a r
oom adjoining th
"e drawing room, "
occupied herself
 trying on the 
new dresses. Jus
t as she had put
 on a bodice wit
hout sleeves and
 only tacked to
"gether, and was "
turning her head
 to see in the g
lass how the ba
"ck fitted, she h"
eard in the draw
ing room the ani
mated sounds of
 her father’s 
voice and anothe
r’s—a woman�
��s—that made 
her flush. It w
as Hélène. Nat
ásha had not ti
me to take off t
he bodice befor
e the door opene
d and Countess B
"ezúkhova, dress"
ed in a purple 
velvet gown with
" a high collar, "
came into the ro
om beaming with 
 good-humored am
iable smiles.  
"
“Oh, my encha"
ntress!” she c
ried to the blus
hing Natásha. 
"“Charming! No,"
 this is really 
"beyond anything,"
" my dear count,�"
�� said she to 
Count Rostóv wh
o had followed h
er in. “How ca
n you live in M
oscow and go now
"here? No, I won�"
��t let you off!
 Mademoiselle Ge
orge will recit
e at my house to
night and there�
��ll be some peo
"ple, and if
you"
 don’t bring y
our lovely girls
—who are prett
ier than Mademoi
selle George—
I won’t know y
ou! My husband i
s away in Tver o
r I would send 
him to fetch you
. You must come.
 You positively 
must! Between ei
ght and nine.�
�  She nodded 
to the dressmake
"r, whom she knew"
 and who had cur
tsied respectfu
"lly to her, and "
seated herself i
n an armchair be
side the lookin
"g glass, draping"
 the folds of he
r velvet dress p
icturesquely. Sh
e did not cease
 chattering good
-naturedly and g
"aily, continuall"
y praising Nat�
�sha’s beauty.
 She looked at N
atásha’s dres
ses and praised 
"
them, as well a"
s a new dress of
 her own made of
 “metallic gau
"ze,”
which sh"
e had received f
"rom Paris, and a"
dvised Natásha 
to have one like
 it.  “But 
anything suits y
"ou, my charmer!�"
�� she remarked.
  A smile of p
leasure never le
ft Natásha’s 
face. She felt h
appy and as if 
she were blossom
ing under the pr
aise of this dea
r Countess Bezú
khova who had f
ormerly seemed t
o her so unappro
achable and impo
rtant and was n
ow so kind to he
r. Natásha brig
htened up and fe
lt almost in lov
e with this wom
"an, who was so b"
eautiful and so 
kind. Hélène f
or her part was 
 sincerely delig
hted with Natás
ha and wished to
 give her a good
 time. Anatole 
had asked her to
 bring him and N
atásha together
", and she was
c"
alling on the Ro
stóvs for that 
purpose. The ide
a of throwing he
r brother and N
atásha together
 amused her.  
Though at one ti
"me, in Petersbur"
"g, she had been "
annoyed with Nat
ásha for drawi
"ng Borís away, "
she did not thin
"k of that now, a"
nd in her own w
ay heartily wish
ed Natásha well
. As she was lea
ving the Rostóv
s she called he
r protégée asi
de.  “My bro
ther dined with 
me yesterday—w
e nearly died of
 laughter—he 
ate nothing and 
kept sighing for
" you, my charmer"
"! He is madly, q"
"uite
madly, in "
"love with you, m"
y dear.”  Na
tásha blushed s
carlet when she 
heard this.  �
��How she blushe
"s, how she blush"
"es, my pretty!�"
� said Hélène.
 “You must ce
rtainly come. If
 you love somebo
"dy, my charmer, "
that is not a r
eason to shut yo
urself up. Even 
if you are engag
"ed, I am sure yo"
ur fiancé woul
d wish you to go
 into society ra
ther than be bor
ed to death.”
  “So she kn
ows I am engaged
", and she and he"
r husband Pierre
—that good Pi
erre—have talk
ed and laughed a
bout this. So it
’s all right.�
"�� And
again, u"
nder Hélène’
"s influence, wha"
t had seemed ter
rible now seemed
 simple and nat
ural. “And she
 is such a grand
"e dame, so kind,"
 and evidently 
likes me so much
. And why not en
joy myself?” t
hought Natásha
", gazing at Hél"
ène with wide-o
"pen, wondering e"
yes.  Márya D
mítrievna came 
back to dinner t
aciturn and seri
"ous, having
evi"
dently suffered 
a defeat at the 
old prince’s. 
She was still to
o agitated by t
he encounter to 
be able to talk 
of the affair ca
lmly. In answer
 to the count’
s inquiries she 
replied that thi
ngs were all ri
ght and that she
 would tell abou
t it next day. O
n hearing of Cou
ntess Bezúkhov
a’s visit and 
the invitation f
"or that evening,"
 Márya Dmítri
evna remarked: 
 “I don’t c
are to have anyt
hing to do with 
Bezúkhova and d
on’t advise y
"ou to; however, "
if you’ve prom
ised—go. It wi
ll divert your 
"thoughts,” she"
" added, addressi"
ng Natásha.  
    CHAPTER 
XIII  Count Ro
stóv took the g
irls to Countess
 Bezúkhova’s.
 There were a g
ood many people 
"there, but nearl"
y all strangers 
to Natásha. Cou
nt Rostóv was 
displeased to se
e that the compa
ny consisted alm
ost entirely of
 men and women k
nown for the fre
edom of their co
nduct. Mademoise
lle George was 
standing in a co
rner of the draw
ing room surroun
ded by young me
n. There were se
veral Frenchmen 
"present, among t"
hem Métivier wh
o from the time
 Hélène reache
d Moscow had bee
n an intimate in
 her house. The 
 count decided n
ot to sit down t
o cards or let h
is girls out of 
his sight and t
o get away as so
on as Mademoisel
le George’s pe
rformance was ov
er.  Anatole w
"as at the door, "
evidently on the
 lookout for the
 Rostóvs. Imme
diately after gr
eeting the count
 he went up to N
atásha and foll
owed her. As so
on as she saw hi
m she was seized
 by the same fee
ling she had ha
d at the opera�
�gratified vanit
y at his admirat
ion of her and f
ear at the abse
nce of a moral b
arrier between t
hem.  Hélène
 welcomed Natás
ha delightedly a
nd was loud in a
dmiration of her
 beauty and her
 dress. Soon aft
er their arrival
 Mademoiselle Ge
orge went out o
f the room to ch
ange her costume
. In the drawing
 room people beg
an arranging th
e chairs and tak
ing their seats.
 Anatole moved a
 chair for Nat�
�sha and was abo
ut to sit down b
"eside her, but t"
"he count, who ne"
ver lost sight 
"of her, took the"
 seat himself. A
natole sat down 
behind her.  M
ademoiselle Geor
"ge, with her bar"
"e, fat, dimpled "
"arms, and a red "
shawl draped ov
"er one shoulder,"
 came into the s
pace left vacant
" for her, and
a"
ssumed an unnatu
ral pose. Enthus
iastic whisperin
g was audible. 
 Mademoiselle G
eorge looked ste
rnly and gloomil
y at the audienc
e and began rec
iting some Frenc
h verses describ
ing her guilty l
ove for her son
. In some places
 she raised her 
"voice, in others"
" she whispered,"
 lifting her hea
d triumphantly; 
sometimes she pa
used and uttered
" hoarse
sounds,"
 rolling her eye
s.  “Adorabl
e! divine! delic
ious!” was hea
rd from every si
de.  Natásha 
looked at the fa
"t actress, but n"
either saw nor h
eard nor unders
tood anything of
 what went on be
fore her. She on
ly felt herself 
 again completel
y borne away int
o this strange s
enseless world�
�so remote from
 her old world�
�a world in whic
h it was impossi
ble to know wha
t was good or ba
"d, reasonable or"
 senseless. Behi
nd her sat Anato
"le,
and conscio"
us of his proxim
ity she experien
ced a frightened
 sense of expec
tancy.  After 
the first monolo
gue the whole co
mpany rose and s
urrounded Madem
"oiselle George, "
expressing their
 enthusiasm.  
“How beautiful
 she is!” Nat�
�sha remarked to
 her father who 
had also risen 
and was moving t
hrough the crowd
 toward the actr
ess.  “I don
’t think so wh
en I look at you
!” said Anatol
"e, following
Na"
tásha. He said 
this at a moment
 when she alone 
could hear him. 
“You are ench
anting... from t
he moment I saw 
you I have never
 ceased...”  
"
“Come, come, "
Natásha!” sai
"d the count, as "
he turned back f
or his daughter
. “How beautif
ul she is!” Na
tásha without s
aying anything 
stepped up to he
r father and loo
ked at him with 
surprised inquir
ing eyes.  Af
ter giving sever
"al recitations, "
Mademoiselle Geo
"rge left, and Co"
untess Bezúkho
va asked her vis
itors into the b
allroom.  The 
count wished to 
"go home, but Hé"
lène entreated 
him not to spoil
 her improvised
" ball, and the R"
ostóvs stayed o
n. Anatole asked
 Natásha for a
 valse and as th
ey danced he pre
ssed her waist a
nd hand and told
 her she was be
witching and tha
t he loved her. 
During the écos
"saise, which
sh"
e also danced wi
"th him, Anatole "
said nothing whe
n they happened 
to be by themse
"lves, but merely"
 gazed at her. N
atásha lifted h
er frightened e
"yes to him, but "
there was such c
onfident tendern
ess in his affec
tionate look an
d smile that she
" could not, whil"
st looking at hi
"m, say what she"
 had to say. She
 lowered her eye
s.  “Don’t
 say such things
 to me. I am bet
rothed and love 
"another,”
she"
 said rapidly...
. She glanced at
 him.  Anatole
 was not upset o
r pained by what
 she had said. 
 “Don’t spe
ak to me of that
! What can I do?
” said he. “
I tell you I am
" madly, madly, i"
n love with you!
 Is it my fault 
that you are en
chanting?... It�
��s our turn to 
begin.”  Nat
"ásha, animated "
"and excited, loo"
ked about her wi
th wide-open fr
ightened eyes an
d seemed merrier
 than usual. She
 understood hard
ly anything tha
t went on that e
vening. They dan
ced the écossai
se and the Gros
svater. Her fath
er asked her to 
"come home, but s"
he begged to rem
ain. Wherever s
he went and whom
ever she was spe
"aking to, she fe"
lt his eyes upo
n her. Later on 
she recalled how
 she had asked h
er father to let
 her go to the 
dressing room to
 rearrange her d
"ress, that Hél�"
�ne had followe
d her and spoken
 laughingly of h
er brother’s l
"ove, and that sh"
e again met Ana
tole in the litt
le sitting room.
 Hélène had di
sappeared leavi
"ng them alone, a"
nd Anatole had t
aken her hand an
d said in a tend
er voice:  �
�I cannot come t
o visit you but 
is it possible t
hat I shall neve
r see you? I lo
ve you madly. Ca
n I never...?”
" and, blocking h"
"er path, he
bro"
ught his face cl
ose to hers.  
"His large, glitt"
"ering, masculine"
 eyes were so cl
ose to hers that
 she saw nothin
g but them.  �
��Natalie?” he
 whispered inqui
ringly while she
 felt her hands 
being painfully
 pressed. “Nat
alie?”  “I
 don’t underst
and. I have noth
"ing to say,” h"
er eyes replied.
  Burning lips
 were pressed to
" hers, and at th"
e same instant s
he felt herself
" released, and H"
élène’s foot
steps and the ru
stle of her dres
s were heard in
 the room. Natá
sha looked round
" at her, and the"
"n, red
and trem"
"bling, threw a f"
rightened look o
f inquiry at Ana
tole and moved 
toward the door.
"

“One word,"
" just one, for G"
od’s sake!” 
cried Anatole. 
 She paused. Sh
e so wanted a wo
rd from him that
 would explain t
o her what had 
happened and to 
which she could 
find no answer. 
"

“Natalie, j"
"ust a word, only"
 one!” he kept
" repeating, evid"
ently not knowi
ng what to say a
nd he repeated i
t till Hélène 
came up to them.
  Hélène ret
urned with Natá
sha to the drawi
ng room. The Ros
tóvs went away
 without staying
 for supper.  
After reaching h
ome Natásha did
 not sleep all n
ight. She was to
rmented by the 
insoluble questi
on whether she l
oved Anatole or 
Prince Andrew. 
She loved Prince
 Andrew—she re
membered distinc
tly how deeply s
he loved him. B
ut she also love
"d Anatole, of th"
at there was no 
doubt. “Else h
ow could all th
is have happened
?” thought she
". “If, after t"
"hat, I could
re"
turn his smile w
hen saying good-
"by, if I was abl"
e to let it come
" to
that, it me"
ans that I loved
 him from the fi
rst. It means th
"at he is
kind, "
"noble, and splen"
"did, and I could"
 not help loving
 him. What am I 
to do if I love
 him and the oth
er one too?” s
he asked herself
", unable to
fin"
d an answer to t
hese terrible qu
estions.    
  CHAPTER XIV 
  Morning came 
with its cares a
nd bustle. Every
one got up and b
egan to move ab
"out and talk, dr"
essmakers came a
gain. Márya Dm�
�trievna appear
"ed, and they wer"
e called to brea
kfast. Natásha 
kept looking un
easily at everyb
ody with wide-op
"en eyes, as if w"
ishing to interc
ept every glanc
e directed towar
"d her, and tried"
 to appear the s
ame as usual.  
 After breakfast
", which was her "
"best time, Máry"
a Dmítrievna sa
t down in her a
rmchair and call
ed Natásha and 
the count to her
".

“Well, fr"
"iends, I have no"
w thought the wh
ole matter over 
and this is my 
"advice,” she b"
egan. “Yesterd
"ay, as you know,"
 I went to see P
rince Bolkónsk
"i. Well, I had a"
 talk with him..
.. He took it in
to his head to 
"begin shouting, "
but I am not one
 to be shouted d
own. I said what
 I had to say!�
"��

“Well, a"
nd he?” asked 
the count.  �
�He? He’s craz
y... he did not 
want to listen. 
But what’s the
 use of talking
? As it is we ha
ve worn the poor
" girl out,” sa"
id Márya Dmít
rievna. “My ad
vice to you is f
inish your busin
ess and go back 
 home to Otrádn
oe... and wait t
here.”  “O
"h, no!” exclai"
med Natásha.  
"
“Yes, go back"
",” said Márya"
" Dmítrievna, �"
�and wait there.
 If your betrot
hed comes here n
ow—there will 
be no avoiding a
 quarrel; but a
lone with the ol
d man he will ta
lk things over a
nd then come on

ount Rostóv app
roved of this su
"ggestion, apprec"
iating its reas
onableness. If t
he old man came 
round it would b
e all the better
 to visit him i
n Moscow or at B
ald Hills later 
"on; and if not, "
"the wedding,
ag"
ainst his wishes
", could only be "
arranged at Otr�
�dnoe.  “Tha
t is perfectly t
rue. And I am so
rry I went to se
e him and took 
"her,” said the"
 old count.  �
"��No, why be sor"
"ry? Being here, "
you had to pay y
our respects. Bu
t if he won’t
—that’s his 
"affair,” said "
Márya Dmítriev
"na, looking for"
 something in he
r reticule. “B
"esides, the trou"
"sseau is ready, "
so there is not
hing to wait for
; and what is no
t ready I’ll s
end after you. 
Though I don’t
 like letting yo
"u go, it is the "
"best way. So go,"
 with God’s b
lessing!”  H
aving found what
 she was looking
 for in the reti
cule she handed 
it to Natásha.
 It was a letter
 from Princess M
ary.  “She h
as written to yo
u. How she torme
"nts herself, poo"
r thing! She’s
 afraid you mig
ht think that sh
e does not like 
you.”  “Bu
t she doesn’t 
"like me,” said"
 Natásha.  �
�Don’t talk no
nsense!” cried
 Márya Dmítrie
vna.  “I sha
n’t believe an
"yone, I know she"
 doesn’t like 
"me,” replied
"
Natásha boldly 
as she took the 
"letter, and her "
face expressed a
 cold and angry
 resolution that
 caused Márya D
mítrievna to lo
ok at her more 
intently and to 
frown.  “Don
’t answer like
" that, my good g"
irl!” she said
. “What I say 
is true! Write 
an answer!”  
 Natásha did no
t reply and went
 to her own room
 to read Princes
s Mary’s lett
er.  Princess 
Mary wrote that 
she was in despa
ir at the misund
erstanding that 
 had occurred be
tween them. What
ever her father�
��s feelings mig
"ht be,
she begg"
ed Natásha to b
elieve that she 
could not help l
oving her as th
e one chosen by 
"her brother, for"
 whose happiness
 she was ready t
o sacrifice eve
rything.  “D
"o not think, how"
"ever,” she wro"
"te, “that my f"
ather is ill-di
sposed toward yo
u. He is an inva
lid and an old m
an who must be 
forgiven; but he
 is good and mag
nanimous and wil
l love her who m
akes his son ha
ppy.” Princess
 Mary went on to
 ask Natásha to
 fix a time when
 she could see 
her again.  Af
ter reading the 
letter Natásha 
sat down at the 
writing table t
o answer it. “
"Dear Princess,�"
� she wrote in F
rench quickly an
"d
mechanically,"
 and then paused
. What more coul
d she write afte
r all that had 
happened the eve
ning before? “
"Yes, yes! All th"
"at has happened,"
 and now all is
" changed,” she"
 thought as she 
sat with the let
ter she had beg
un before her. �
��Must I break o
ff with him? Mus
t I really? That
’s awful...�
� and to escape 
from these dread
ful thoughts she
 went to Sónya
 and began sorti
ng patterns with
 her.  After d
inner Natásha w
ent to her room 
and again took u
p Princess Mary
’s letter. “
Can it be that i
t is all over?�
� she thought. 
“Can it be tha
t all this has h
appened so quick
ly and has destr
oyed all that w
ent before?” S
he recalled her 
love for Prince 
Andrew in all it
s former streng
"th, and at the s"
ame time felt th
at she loved Kur
ágin. She vivi
dly pictured her
self as Prince A
"ndrew’s wife, "
and the scenes o
f happiness wit
h him she had so
 often repeated 
in her imaginati
"on, and
at the "
"same time, aglow"
 with excitement
", recalled every"
 detail of yest
erday’s interv
iew with Anatole
.  “Why coul
d that not be as
 well?” she so
metimes asked he
rself in comple
te bewilderment.
 “Only so coul
d I be completel
y happy; but now
 I have to choo
"se, and I can’"
t be happy witho
ut either of the
"m. Only,”
she"
" thought, “to "
tell Prince Andr
ew what has happ
ened or to hide 
 it from him are
 both equally im
possible. But wi
th that one noth
ing is spoiled.
 But am I really
 to abandon fore
ver the joy of P
rince Andrew’s
"
love, in which"
 I have lived so
 long?”  “
"Please, Miss!”"
 whispered a mai
d entering the r
oom with a myste
rious air. “A
 man told me to 
give you this—
” and she hand
ed Natásha a l
etter.  “Onl
"y, for Christ’"
s sake...” the
" girl went on, a"
"s Natásha,
wit"
"hout thinking, m"
echanically brok
e the seal and r
ead a love lette
"r
from Anatole,"
" of which, witho"
ut taking in a w
"ord, she underst"
ood only that i
t was a letter f
rom him—from t
he man she loved
". Yes, she loved"
"
him, or else h"
ow could that ha
ve happened whic
h had happened? 
And how could s
he have a love l
etter from him i
n her hand?  W
ith trembling ha
nds Natásha hel
d that passionat
e love letter wh
ich Dólokhov h
ad composed for 
"Anatole, and as "
she read it she 
found in it an 
echo of all that
 she herself ima
gined she was fe
eling.  “Sin
ce yesterday eve
ning my fate has
 been sealed; to
 be loved by you
 or to die. The
re is no other w
"ay for me,” th"
e letter began. 
Then he went on
 to say that he 
knew her parents
 would not give 
her to him—for
 this there wer
e secret reasons
 he could reveal
 only to her—b
ut that if she 
loved him she ne
ed only say the 
"word yes, and no"
 human power cou
ld hinder their
 bliss. Love wou
ld conquer all. 
He would steal h
er away and car
ry her off to th
e ends of the ea
"rth.

“Yes, "
yes! I love him!
” thought Nat�
"�sha, reading th"
e letter for the
 twentieth time
 and finding som
e peculiarly dee
p meaning in eac
h word of it. 
 That evening M
árya Dmítrievn
a was going to t
he Akhárovs’ 
and proposed to
 take the girls 
with her. Natás
"ha, pleading a h"
"eadache,
remain"
ed at home.   
    CHAPTER X
V  On returnin
g late in the ev
ening Sónya wen
t to Natásha’
"s room, and
to "
her surprise fou
nd her still dre
ssed and asleep 
on the sofa. Ope
"n on
the table,"
 beside her lay 
Anatole’s lett
er. Sónya picke
d it up and rea
d it.  As she 
read she glanced
 at the sleeping
" Natásha, tryin"
g to find in her
 face an explan
ation of what sh
"e was reading, b"
ut did not find 
it. Her face wa
"s calm, gentle, "
and happy. Clutc
hing her breast 
to keep herself 
"
from choking, S"
"ónya, pale and "
trembling with f
ear and agitatio
"n, sat
down in "
an armchair and 
burst into tears
.  “How was 
it I noticed not
hing? How could 
it go so far? Ca
n she have left
 off loving Prin
ce Andrew? And h
ow could she let
 Kurágin go to 
 such lengths? H
e is a deceiver 
"and a villain, t"
hat’s plain! W
hat will Nichol
"as, dear noble N"
"icholas, do when"
 he hears of it?
 So this is the
 meaning of her 
"excited, resolut"
"e, unnatural loo"
k the day before
"
yesterday, yes"
"terday, and toda"
"y,” thought S�"
�nya. “But it 
can’t be that
 she loves him! 
She probably ope
ned the letter w
ithout knowing w
ho it was from.
 Probably she is
 offended by it.
 She could not d
o such a thing!
”  Sónya wi
ped away her tea
rs and went up t
"o Natásha, agai"
n scanning her 
face.  “Nat�
�sha!” she sai
"d, just audibly."
  Natásha awo
ke and saw Sóny
"a.

“Ah, you"
’re back?” 
 And with the d
ecision and tend
erness that ofte
n come at the mo
ment of awakeni
"ng, she embraced"
" her friend, but"
 noticing Sónya
’s look of em
"barrassment, her"
 own face expres
sed confusion an
d suspicion.  
"“Sónya, you�"
�ve read that le
tter?” she dem
anded.  “Yes
",” answered S�"
�nya softly.  
Natásha smiled 
rapturously.  
"“No, Sónya, I"
 can’t any lon
ger!” she said
. “I can’t h
ide it from you
 any longer. You
" know, we love o"
ne another! Són
"ya, darling, he"
 writes... Sóny
a...”  Sóny
a stared open-ey
"ed at Natásha, "
unable to believ
e her ears.  �
��And Bolkónski
?” she asked. 
"

“Ah, Sónya"
", if you only kn"
ew how happy I a
m!” cried Nat�
�sha. “You do
n’t know what 
love is....” 
"
“But, Natás"
"ha, can that be "
all over?”  
Natásha looked 
at Sónya with w
ide-open eyes as
 if she could no
t grasp the que
stion.  “Wel
"l, then, are you"
 refusing Prince
 Andrew?” said
 Sónya.  “O
"h, you don’t u"
nderstand anythi
ng! Don’t talk
" nonsense, just"
 listen!” said
" Natásha, with "
momentary vexati
on.  “But I 
can’t believe 
"it,” insisted "
Sónya. “I don
’t understand
. How is it you 
have loved a man
 for a whole yea
r and suddenly.
".. Why, you have"
 only seen him t
hree times! Nat�
"�sha, I don’t"
"
believe you, yo"
u’re joking! I
n three days to 
forget everythin
g and so...” 
  “Three days
?” said Natás
ha. “It seems 
to me I’ve lov
ed him a hundre
d years. It seem
s to me that I h
ave never loved 
anyone before. Y
ou can’t unde
rstand it.... S�
"�nya, wait a bit"
", sit here,” a"
nd Natásha emb
raced and kissed
 her.  “I ha
d heard that it 
happens like thi
"s, and you must "
have heard it t
"oo, but it’s o"
nly now that I f
eel such love. I
t’s not the sa
me as before. A
s soon as I saw 
him I felt he wa
s my master and 
"I his slave,
an"
d that I could n
ot help loving h
"im. Yes, his sla"
ve! Whatever he 
orders I shall 
do. You don’t 
understand that.
 What can I do? 
"What can I do,
"
Sónya?” cried
 Natásha with a
 happy yet frigh
tened expression
.  “But thin
k what you are d
"oing,” cried S"
ónya. “I can�
��t leave it li
ke this. This se
cret corresponde
nce... How could
 you let him go 
so far?” she 
"went on, with a "
horror and disgu
st she could har
dly conceal.  
“I told you th
at I have no wil
"l,” Natásha r"
eplied. “Why c
an’t you unde
rstand? I love h
im!”  “The
n I won’t let 
it come to that.
.. I shall tell!
” cried Sónya
",
bursting into"
 tears.  “Wh
at do you mean? 
For God’s sake
"... If you tell,"
 you are my ene
my!” declared 
Natásha. “You
 want me to be m
"iserable, you wa"
nt us to be sep
arated....”  
 When she saw Na
tásha’s frigh
"t, Sónya shed t"
ears of shame an
d pity for her 
friend.  “Bu
t what has happe
ned between you?
” she asked. �
��What has he sa
id to you? Why 
doesn’t he com
e to the house?�
��  Natásha d
id not answer he
r questions.  
“For God’s s
"ake, Sónya, don"
’t tell anyone
", don’t tortur"
"e
me,” Natás"
ha entreated. �
�Remember no one
 ought to interf
ere in such mat
ters! I have con
fided in you....
”  “But wh
y this secrecy? 
Why doesn’t he
 come to the hou
se?” asked S�
�nya. “Why doe
sn’t he openly
 ask for your ha
nd? You know Pri
nce Andrew gave
 you complete fr
eedom—if it is
 really so; but 
I don’t belie
"ve it! Natásha,"
 have you consid
ered what these 
secret reasons c
an be?”  Na
tásha looked at
 Sónya with ast
onishment. Evide
ntly this questi
on presented it
self to her mind
 for the first t
ime and she did 
not know how to
 answer it.  �
��I don’t know
 what the reason
s are. But there
 must be reasons
!”  Sónya s
ighed and shook 
her head incredu
lously.  “If
 there were reas
ons...” she be
gan.  But Nat�
"�sha, guessing h"
"er doubts, inter"
rupted her in al
arm.  “Sóny
"a, one can’t d"
oubt him! One ca
"n’t, one can�"
�t! Don’t you 
 understand?” 
she cried.  �
�Does he love yo
u?”  “Does
 he love me?” 
Natásha repeate
d with a smile o
f pity at her f
riend’s lack o
f comprehension.
" “Why, you hav"
e read his lette
r and you have 
seen him.”  
“But if he is 
dishonorable?”
  “He! disho
norable? If you 
only knew!” ex
claimed Natásha
.  “If he is
 an honorable ma
n he should eith
er declare his i
ntentions or ce
ase seeing you; 
and if you won�
"�t do this, I wi"
ll. I will write
" to
him, and I "
will tell Papa!�
�� said Sónya r
esolutely.  �
�But I can’t l
ive without him!
” cried Natás
ha.  “Natás
"ha, I don’t un"
derstand you. An
d what are you s
aying! Think of 
 your father and
 of Nicholas.”
  “I don’t
" want anyone, I "
don’t love any
one but him. How
 dare you say h
e is dishonorabl
e? Don’t you k
now that I love 
him?” screamed
 Natásha. “G
"o away, Sónya! "
I don’t want t
o quarrel with y
"ou, but
go, for"
 God’s sake go
! You see how I 
am suffering!”
 Natásha cried 
"
angrily, in a v"
oice of despair 
and repressed ir
ritation. Sónya
 burst into sob
s and ran from t
he room.  Nat�
�sha went to the
 table and witho
ut a moment’s 
reflection wrote
 that answer to
 Princess Mary w
hich she had bee
n unable to writ
e all the morni
ng. In this lett
er she said brie
fly that all the
ir misunderstan
dings were at an
 end; that avail
ing herself of t
he magnanimity 
of Prince Andrew
 who when he wen
t abroad had giv
en her her free
"dom, she begged "
Princess Mary to
 forget everythi
ng and forgive h
er if she had b
een to blame tow
"ard her, but tha"
t she could not 
be his wife. At
 that moment thi
s all seemed qui
"te easy, simple,"
 and clear to N
atásha.   On
 Friday the Rost
óvs were to ret
urn to the count
"ry, but on Wedne"
sday the count 
went with the pr
ospective purcha
ser to his estat
e near Moscow. 
 On the day the
" count left, Só"
nya and Natásha
 were invited to
 a big dinner p
arty at the Kar�
"�gins’, and M�"
�rya Dmítrievna
 took them ther
e. At that party
 Natásha again 
"met Anatole, and"
 Sónya noticed 
 that she spoke 
"to him, trying n"
ot to be overhea
"rd, and that all"
 through dinner
 she was more ag
itated than ever
. When they got 
home Natásha wa
s the first to 
begin the explan
ation Sónya exp
ected.  “The
"re, Sónya, you "
were talking all
 sorts of nonsen
"se about him,”"
 Natásha began
 in a mild voice
 such as childre
n use when they 
wish to be prai
sed. “We have 
had an explanati
on today.”  
"“Well, what ha"
ppened? What did
 he say? Natásh
"a, how glad I am"
 you’re not a
ngry with me! Te
ll me everything
—the whole tru
th. What did he
 say?”  Nat�
�sha became thou
ghtful.  “Oh
", Sónya, if you"
 knew him as I d
o! He said... He
 asked me what I
 had promised B
olkónski. He wa
s glad I was fre
e to refuse him.
”  Sónya si
ghed sorrowfully
.  “But you 
haven’t refuse
d Bolkónski?”
 said she.  �
�Perhaps I have.
 Perhaps all is 
over between me 
and Bolkónski. 
Why do you thin
k so badly of me
?”  “I don
’t think anyth
"ing, only I don�"
��t understand t
his...”  “
"Wait a bit, Són"
"ya, you’ll und"
erstand everythi
ng. You’ll see
 what a man he 
is! Now don’t 
think badly of m
e or of him. I d
on’t think ba
dly of anyone: I
 love and pity e
verybody. But wh
at am I to do?�
�  Sónya did 
not succumb to t
he tender tone N
atásha used tow
ard her. The mo
re emotional and
 ingratiating th
e expression of 
Natásha’s fac
"e
became, the m"
ore serious and 
stern grew Sóny
a’s.  “Nat
"ásha,” said s"
"he, “you asked"
 me not to speak
" to you, and I
"
haven’t spoken
", but now you yo"
urself have begu
n. I don’t tru
"st him,
Natásh"
a. Why this secr
ecy?”  “Ag
"ain, again!” i"
nterrupted Natá
sha.  “Natá
"sha, I am afraid"
 for you!”  
“Afraid of wha
t?”  “I am
 afraid you’re
 going to your r
"uin,” said Só"
"nya resolutely,"
 and was herself
 horrified at wh
at she had said.
  Anger again 
showed in Natás
ha’s face.  
“And I’ll go
" to my ruin, I w"
"ill, as soon as "
possible! It’s
 not your busin
ess! It won’t 
"be you, but I, w"
ho’ll suffer. 
"Leave me
alone,"
 leave me alone!
 I hate you!” 
  “Natásha!�
�� moaned Sónya
", aghast.

“"
"I hate you, I ha"
te you! You’re
 my enemy foreve
r!” And Natás
ha ran out of t
he room.  Nat�
�sha did not spe
ak to Sónya aga
in and avoided h
er. With the sam
e expression of
 agitated surpri
se and guilt she
 went about the 
"house,
taking u"
p now one occupa
"tion, now anothe"
"r, and at once a"
bandoning them. 
  Hard as it wa
"s for Sónya, sh"
e watched her fr
iend and did not
 let her out of
 her sight.  T
he day before th
e count was to r
"eturn, Sónya no"
ticed that Natá
sha sat by the 
drawing room win
dow all the morn
ing as if expect
ing something an
d that she made
 a sign to an of
ficer who drove 
"past, whom Sóny"
a took to be An
atole.  Sónya
 began watching 
her friend still
 more attentivel
y and noticed th
at at dinner an
d all that eveni
ng Natásha was 
in a strange and
 unnatural stat
e. She answered 
questions at ran
"dom, began sente"
nces she did not
"
finish, and la"
ughed at everyth
ing.  After te
a Sónya noticed
 a housemaid at 
Natásha’s doo
r timidly waiti
ng to let her pa
ss. She let the 
"girl go in, and "
then listening a
t the door lear
ned that another
 letter had been
 delivered.  T
hen suddenly it 
became clear to 
Sónya that Nat�
�sha had some dr
eadful plan for
 that evening. S
ónya knocked at
 her door. Natá
sha did not let 
 her in.  “S
he will run away
 with him!” th
ought Sónya. �
�She is capable 
of anything. Th
ere was somethin
g particularly p
athetic and reso
lute in her fac
e today. She cri
ed as she said g
"ood-by to Uncle,"
” Sónya reme
"mbered. “Yes, "
"that’s it, she"
 means to elope 
"with him, but
w"
hat am I to do?�
"�� thought she, "
recalling all th
e signs that cle
arly indicated 
that Natásha ha
d some terrible 
intention. “Th
e count is away
. What am I to d
o? Write to Kur�
�gin demanding a
n explanation? B
ut what is ther
e to oblige him 
to reply? Write 
"to Pierre, as Pr"
ince Andrew ask

 of some misfort
une?... But perh
aps she really 
has already refu
sed Bolkónski�
�she sent a lett
er to Princess M
ary yesterday. 
And Uncle is awa
y....” To tell
 Márya Dmítrie
vna who had suc
h faith in Natá
sha seemed to S�
�nya terrible. �
"��Well, anyway,�"
�� thought Són
ya as she stood 
in the dark pass
"age, “now or n"
ever I must pro
ve that I rememb
er the family’

APTER XVI  Ana
tole had lately 
moved to Dólokh
ov’s. The plan
 for Natalie Ro
stóva’s abduc
tion had been ar
ranged and the p
reparations made
 by Dólokhov a
 few days before
", and on the day"
" that Sónya, af"
ter listening a
t Natásha’s d
"oor, resolved to"
" safeguard her, "
it was to have b
een put into ex
ecution. Natásh
a had promised t
o come out to Ku
rágin at the b
ack porch at ten
 that evening. K
urágin was to p
ut her into a tr
oyka he would h
ave ready and to
 drive her forty
 miles to the vi
llage of Kámen
"ka, where an unf"
rocked priest wa
s in readiness t
o perform a mar
riage ceremony o
ver them. At Ká
menka a relay of
 horses was to w
ait which would
 take them to th
e Warsaw highroa
"d, and from ther"
e they would ha
sten abroad with
 post horses.  
 Anatole had a p
"assport, an orde"
r for post horse
"s, ten thousand "
rubles he had t
aken from his si
ster and another
 ten thousand bo
rrowed with Dó
lokhov’s help.
  Two witnesse
s for the mock m
arriage—Khvós
"tikov, a retired"
 petty official
 whom Dólokhov 
made use of in h
is gambling tran
"sactions, and
M"
"akárin, a retir"
"ed hussar, a kin"
"dly, weak fellow"
 who had an unbo
unded affection
 for Kurágin—
were sitting at 
tea in Dólokhov
’s front room
.  In his larg
"e study, the wal"
ls of which were
 hung to the cei
ling with Persi
"an rugs, bearski"
"ns, and weapons,"
 sat Dólokhov i
n a traveling cl
oak and high bo
"ots, at an open "
desk on which la
y an abacus and 
some bundles of
 paper money. An
"atole, with unif"
"orm unbuttoned, "
walked to and fr
o from the room
 where the witne
sses were sittin
"g, through the s"
tudy to the room
"
behind, where "
his French valet
 and others were
 packing the las
t of his things
. Dólokhov was 
counting the mon
ey and noting so
mething down.  
"
“Well,” he "
"said, “Khvóst"
ikov must have t
wo thousand.” 
  “Give it to
" him, then,” s"
aid Anatole.  
“Makárka” (
their name for M
akárin) “will
 go through fire
 and water for 
you for nothing.
 So here are our
 accounts all se
"ttled,” said
"
"Dólokhov, showi"
ng him the memor
andum. “Is tha
t right?”  �
"��Yes, of course"
",” returned An"
"atole, evidently"
 not listening t
o Dólokhov and
 looking straigh
t before him wit
h a smile that d
id not leave hi
s face.  Dólo
khov banged down
 the lid of his 
desk and turned 
to Anatole with 
an ironic smile
:  “Do you k
now? You’d rea
lly better drop 
it all. There’
s still time!�
"�

“Fool,”"
 retorted Anatol
e. “Don’t ta
lk nonsense! If 
you only knew..
. it’s the dev
il knows what!�
"�

“No, real"
"ly, give it up!�"
�� said Dólokho
v. “I am speak
ing seriously. 
"It’s no joke, "
this plot you’
ve hatched.” 
"
“What, teasi"
ng again? Go to 
the devil! Eh?�
"� said Anatole, "
making a grimac
e. “Really it�
��s no time for 
your stupid joke
"s,” and he lef"
t the room.  
Dólokhov smiled
 contemptuously 
and condescendin
gly when Anatole
 had gone out. 
  “You wait a
" bit,” he call"
ed after him. �
�I’m not jokin
"g, I’m
talkin"
g sense. Come he
"re, come here!�"
�  Anatole ret
urned and looked
" at Dólokhov, t"
rying to give hi
m his attention
 and evidently s
ubmitting to him
 involuntarily. 
  “Now listen
 to me. I’m te
lling you this f
or the last time
. Why should I 
joke about it? D
id I hinder you?
 Who arranged ev
erything for yo
u? Who found the
 priest and got 
the passport? Wh
o raised the mon
ey? I did it al
l.”  “Well
", thank you for "
it. Do you think
 I am not gratef
ul?” And Anat
ole sighed and e
mbraced Dólokho
v.  “I helpe
"d you, but all t"
he same I must t
ell you the trut
h; it is a dang
"erous business, "
and if you think
 about it—a st
upid business. W
"ell,
you’ll c"
arry her off—a
ll right! Will t
hey let it stop 
at that? It wil
l come out that 
you’re already
" married. Why, t"
hey’ll have yo
u in the crimin
al court....” 
"

“Oh, nonsen"
"se, nonsense!”"
 Anatole ejacula
ted and again ma
de a grimace. �
��Didn’t I exp
lain to you? Wha
t?” And Anatol
"e, with the
par"
tiality dull-wit
ted people have 
for any conclusi
on they have rea
ched by their o
"wn reasoning, re"
peated the argum
ent he had alrea
dy put to Dólo
khov a hundred t
imes. “Didn’
t I explain to y
ou that I have c
ome to this con
clusion: if this
 marriage is inv
"alid,” he went"
" on, crooking
o"
"ne finger, “th"
en I have nothin
g to answer for;
 but if it is va
"lid, no
matter!"
 Abroad no one w
ill know anythin
g about it. Isn�
��t that so? And
 don’t talk t
"o me, don’t, d"
on’t.”  �
"�Seriously, you�"
��d better drop 
it! You’ll onl
y get yourself i
nto a mess!” 
  “Go to the 
devil!” cried 
"Anatole and, clu"
"tching his hair,"
" left the
room,"
 but returned at
 once and droppe
d into an armcha
ir in front of 
Dólokhov with h
is feet turned u
nder him. “It�
��s the very dev
il! What? Feel 
how it beats!”
 He took Dólokh
ov’s hand and 
put it on his h
eart. “What a 
"foot, my dear fe"
llow! What a gla
nce! A goddess!�
�� he added in 
French. “What?
”  Dólokhov
 with a cold smi
le and a gleam i
n his handsome i
nsolent eyes lo
oked at him—ev
idently wishing 
to get some more
 amusement out o
f him.  “Wel
l and when the m
"oney’s gone, w"
hat then?”  
“What then? Eh
?” repeated An
"atole, sincerely"
 perplexed by a 
thought of the 
future. “What 
"then?... Then, I"
 don’t know...
. But why talk 
nonsense!” He 
glanced at his w
atch. “It’s 
time!”  Anat
ole went into th
e back room.  
“Now then! Nea
rly ready? You�
�re dawdling!”
 he shouted to t
he servants.  
 Dólokhov put a
"way the money, c"
alled a footman 
whom he ordered 
to bring someth
ing for them to 
eat and drink be
fore the journey
", and went into"
 the room where 
Khvóstikov and 
Makárin were si
tting.  Anatol
e lay on the sof
a in the study l
eaning on his el
bow and smiling 
"
pensively, whil"
e his handsome l
ips muttered ten
derly to himself
.  “Come and
 eat something. 
Have a drink!”
 Dólokhov shout
ed to him from 
the other room. 
  “I don’t 
"want to,” answ"
ered Anatole con
tinuing to smile
.  “Come! Ba
lagá is here.�
�  Anatole ros
e and went into 
the dining room.
 Balagá was a f
amous troyka dr
iver who had kno
wn Dólokhov and
 Anatole some si
x years and had 
given them good
 service with hi
s troykas. More 
than once when A
natole’s regi
ment was station
ed at Tver he ha
d taken him from
 Tver in the ev
"ening, brought h"
im to Moscow by 
"daybreak, and dr"
iven him back ag
ain the next ni
ght. More than o
nce he had enabl
ed Dólokhov to 
escape when pur
sued. More than 
once he had driv
en them through 
the town with gy
psies and “la
dykins” as he 
called the cocot
tes. More than o
nce in their se
rvice he had run
 over pedestrian
s and upset vehi
cles in the stre
ets of Moscow a
nd had always be
en protected fro
m the consequenc
es by “my gen
tlemen” as he 
called them. He 
had ruined more 
than one horse i
n their service
. More than once
 they had beaten
" him, and more t"
han once they h
ad made him drun
k on champagne a
"nd Madeira, whic"
h he loved; and 
 he knew more th
an one thing abo
ut each of them 
which would long
 ago have sent 
an ordinary man 
to Siberia. They
 often called Ba
lagá into their
 orgies and mad
e him drink and 
dance at the gyp
"sies’, and mor"
e than one thou
sand rubles of t
heir money had p
assed through hi
s hands. In thei
r service he ri
sked his skin an
d his life twent
"y times a year, "
and in their se
rvice had lost m
ore horses than 
the money he had
 from them would
 buy. But he li
ked them; liked 
that mad driving
 at twelve miles
" an hour,
liked"
 upsetting a dri
ver or running d
own a pedestrian
", and flying at"
 full gallop thr
ough the Moscow 
streets. He like
d to hear those 
"wild,
tipsy sho"
uts behind him: 
“Get on! Get o
n!” when it wa
s impossible to
 go any faster. 
He liked giving 
a painful lash o
n the neck to so
"me
peasant who,"
 more dead than 
"alive, was alrea"
dy hurrying out 
of his way. “
Real gentlemen!�
�� he considered
 them.  Anatol
e and Dólokhov 
liked Balagá to
o for his master
ly driving and 
because he liked
 the things they
 liked. With oth
ers Balagá barg
"ained,
charging"
 twenty-five rub
les for a two ho
"urs’ drive, an"
d rarely drove 
"himself, general"
ly letting his y
oung men do so. 
But with “his 
 gentlemen” he
 always drove hi
mself and never 
demanded anythin
g for his work.
 Only a couple o
f times a year�
�when he knew fr
om their valets 
 that they had m
oney in hand—h
e would turn up 
of a morning qui
te sober and wi
th a deep bow wo
uld ask them to 
help him. The ge
ntlemen always 
made him sit dow
n.  “Do help
" me out, Theodor"
"e Iványch, sir,"
” or “your e
"xcellency,”
h"
e would say. “
I am quite out o
f horses. Let me
 have what you c
an to go to the
 fair.”  And
 Anatole and Dó
"lokhov, when the"
"y had money, wou"
ld give him a t
housand or a cou
ple of thousand 
rubles.  Balag
á was a fair-ha
"ired, short, and"
 snub-nosed peas
ant of about tw
enty-seven; red-
"faced, with a pa"
rticularly red t
"hick neck, glitt"
ering little ey
"es, and a small "
beard. He wore a
" fine, dark-blue"
", silk-lined
cl"
oth coat over a 
sheepskin.  On
 entering the ro
om now he crosse
"d himself, turni"
ng toward the fr
ont corner of t
"he room, and wen"
t up to Dólokho
"v, holding out a"
" small, black
h"
and.  “Theod
ore Iványch!”
" he said, bowing"
.  “How d’
"you do, friend? "
"Well, here he is"
!”  “Good 
"day, your excell"
ency!” he said
", again holding "
out his hand to 
 Anatole who had
 just come in. 
"
“I say, Bala"
"gá,” said Ana"
"tole, putting hi"
s hands on the m
an’s shoulder
"s, “do you car"
e for me or not?
" Eh? Now, do me "
a service.... W
hat horses have 
you come with? E
h?”  “As y
our messenger or
"dered, your spec"
"ial beasts,” r"
eplied Balagá. 
"

“Well, list"
"en, Balagá! Dri"
ve all three to 
death but get me
 there in three
 hours. Eh?” 
 “When they a
"re dead, what sh"
all I drive?” 
said Balagá wit
h a wink.  “
"Mind, I’ll sma"
sh your face in!
 Don’t make jo
kes!” cried A
"natole, suddenly"
 rolling his eye
s.  “Why jok
e?” said the d
"river, laughing."
 “As if I’d 
grudge my gentl
emen anything! A
s fast as ever t
he horses can ga
"llop, so fast
w"
e’ll go!”  
 “Ah!” said 
Anatole. “Well
", sit down.”
"
"
“Yes, sit do"
wn!” said Dól
okhov.  “I�
"�ll stand, Theod"
ore Iványch.”
  “Sit down;
 nonsense! Have 
a drink!” said
" Anatole, and fi"
lled a large gl
ass of Madeira f
or him.  The d
river’s eyes s
parkled at the s
ight of the wine
. After refusing
 it for manners
"’ sake, he dra"
nk it and wiped 
his mouth with a
 red silk handk
erchief he took 
out of his cap. 
  “And when a
"re we to start, "
your excellency?
”  “Well..
.” Anatole loo
ked at his watch
. “We’ll sta
rt at once. Min
"d, Balagá! You�"
��ll get there i
n time? Eh?” 
 “That depend
s on our luck in
" starting, else "
why shouldn’t 
we be there in 
time?” replied
 Balagá. “Did
n’t we get you
 to Tver in sev
en hours? I thin
k you remember t
"hat, your excell"
ency?”  “D
"o you know, one "
Christmas I drov
"e from Tver,” "
"said Anatole,
s"
milingly at the 
recollection and
 turning to Mak�
�rin who gazed 
rapturously at h
im with wide-ope
n eyes. “Will 
"you believe it,"
"
Makárka, it to"
ok one’s breat
"h away, the rate"
 we flew. We cam
e across a trai
n of loaded slei
ghs and drove ri
ght over two of 
them. Eh?”  
“Those were ho
rses!” Balagá
 continued the t
ale. “That tim
e I’d harness
ed two young sid
e horses with th
e bay in the sha
"fts,” he went"
"
on, turning to "
Dólokhov. “Wi
ll you believe i
"t, Theodore Ivá"
"nych,
those ani"
mals flew forty 
miles? I couldn�
��t hold them in
", my hands grew"
 numb in the sha
rp frost so that
 I threw down th
e reins—‘Cat
ch hold yoursel
"f, your excellen"
"cy!’ says I, a"
nd I just tumble
d on the bottom 
 of the sleigh a
nd sprawled ther
e. It wasn’t a
 case of urging 
"them on,
there "
was no holding t
hem in till we r
eached the place
. The devils too
k us there in t
hree hours! Only
 the near one di
ed of it.”  
    CHAPTER 
XVII  Anatole 
went out of the 
room and returne
d a few minutes 
later wearing a
 fur coat girt w
ith a silver bel
"t, and a sable c"
ap jauntily set 
on one side and
 very becoming t
o his handsome f
ace. Having look
"ed in a mirror,"
 and standing be
fore Dólokhov i
n the same pose 
he had assumed b
"efore it,
he li"
fted a glass of 
wine.  “Well
", good-by, Theod"
ore. Thank you f
or everything an
d farewell!” s
aid Anatole. �
"�Well, comrades "
and friends...�
� he considered 
for a moment “
... of my youth
", farewell!” h"
"e said, turning "
to Makárin and 
the others.  T
hough they were 
all going with h
"im, Anatole evid"
ently wished to 
make something 
touching and sol
emn out of this 
address to his c
omrades. He spo
ke slowly in a l
oud voice and th
rowing out his c
hest slightly sw
ayed one leg. 
 “All take gl
"asses; you too, "
"Balagá. Well, c"
omrades and frie
nds of my youth
", we’ve had ou"
r fling and live
d and reveled. E
"h? And now, when"
 shall we meet 
again? I am goin
g abroad. We hav
e had a good tim
e—now farewel
"l, lads! To our "
health! Hurrah!.
"..” he cried, "
and emptying his
 glass flung it
 on the floor. 
 “To your hea
lth!” said Bal
agá who also em
"ptied his glass,"
 and wiped his 
mouth with his h
andkerchief.  
Makárin embrace
d Anatole with t
ears in his eyes
".

“Ah, Prin"
"ce, how sorry I "
am to part from 
you!  “Let�
�s go. Let’s g
o!” cried Anat
ole.  Balagá 
was about to lea
ve the room.  
"“No, stop!” "
said Anatole. �
�Shut the door; 
we have first to
 sit down. That
’s the way.”
  They shut th
e door and all s
at down.  “N
"ow, quick march,"
 lads!” said A
"natole, rising."
"

Joseph, his v"
"alet, handed him"
 his sabretache 
"and saber, and t"
hey all went ou
t into the vesti
bule.  “And 
where’s the fu
r cloak?” aske
d Dólokhov. “
"Hey, Ignátka! G"
o to Matrëna M
atrévna and ask
 her for the sab
le cloak. I have
 heard what elo
pements are like
",” continued D"
ólokhov with a 
"wink. “Why, sh"
e’ll rush out
 more dead than 
alive just in th
e things she is 
wearing; if you 
delay at all th
ere’ll be tear
s and ‘Papa’
" and ‘Mamma,�"
� and she’s fr
ozen in a minut
e and must go ba
ck—but you wra
p the fur cloak 
round her first 
thing and carry
 her to the slei
gh.”  The va
let brought a wo
man’s fox-line
d cloak.  “F
"ool, I told you "
the sable one! H
"ey, Matrëna, th"
e sable!” he s
houted so that 
his voice rang f
ar through the r
ooms.  A hands
"ome, slim, and p"
ale-faced gypsy 
girl with glitte
ring black eyes 
 and curly blue-
"black hair, wear"
"ing a red shawl,"
 ran out with a 
sable mantle on
 her arm.  “
"Here, I don’t "
grudge it—take
 it!” she said
", evidently afra"
id of her maste
r and yet regret
ful of her cloak
".

Dólokhov, "
without answerin
"g, took the cloa"
"k, threw it over"
" Matrëna, and
"
wrapped her up i
n it.  “That
"’s the way,”"
" said Dólokhov,"
 “and then so!
” and he turne
d the collar up
" round her head,"
 leaving only a 
little of the fa
ce uncovered. �
"�And
then so, d"
o you see?” an
d he pushed Anat
ole’s head for
ward to meet the
 gap left by th
"e collar, throug"
h which Matrëna
’s brilliant s
mile was seen. 
"

“Well, good"
"-by, Matrëna,�"
"� said Anatole, "
kissing her. “
"Ah, my revels he"
re are over. Re
member me to St�
"�shka. There, go"
"od-by! Good-by, "
"Matrëna, wish
"
me luck!”  �
"��Well, Prince, "
may God give you
 great luck!” 
said Matrëna in
 her gypsy acce
nt.  Two troyk
as were standing
 before the porc
h and two young 
drivers were ho
lding the horses
. Balagá took h
is seat in the f
ront one and hol
ding his elbows
 high arranged t
he reins deliber
ately. Anatole a
nd Dólokhov go
t in with him. M
"akárin, Khvóst"
"ikov, and a vale"
t seated themsel
ves in the othe
r sleigh.  “
"Well, are you re"
ady?” asked Ba
lagá.  “Go!
"” he cried, tw"
isting the reins
 round his hands
", and the troyka"
 tore down the 
Nikítski Boulev
ard.  “Tproo
! Get out of the
 way! Hi!... Tpr
oo!...” The sh
outing of Balag�
� and of the st
urdy young fello
w seated on the 
box was all that
 could be heard
. On the Arbát 
Square the troyk
a caught against
 a carriage; so
"mething cracked,"
 shouts were hea
"rd, and the troy"
ka flew along th
e Arbát Street
.  After takin
g a turn along t
he Podnovínski 
"Boulevard, Balag"
á began to rei
"n in, and turnin"
g back drew up a
t the crossing o
f the old Konyú
sheny Street. 
 The young fell
ow on the box ju
mped down to hol
d the horses and
 Anatole and D�
�lokhov went alo
ng the pavement.
 When they reach
ed the gate Dó
lokhov whistled.
 The whistle was
" answered, and a"
 maidservant ran
 out.  “Come
 into the courty
ard or you’ll 
be seen; she’l
l come out direc
"tly,”
said sh"
e.  Dólokhov 
stayed by the ga
te. Anatole foll
owed the maid in
to the courtyar
"d, turned the co"
"rner, and ran up"
 into the porch.
  He was met b
"y Gabriel, Máry"
a Dmítrievna’
s gigantic footm
an.  “Come t
"o the mistress, "
"please,” said "
the footman in h
"is deep bass,
i"
ntercepting any 
retreat.  “T
o what Mistress?
 Who are you?”
 asked Anatole i
n a breathless w
hisper.  “Ki
"ndly step in, my"
 orders are to b
ring you in.” 
  “Kurágin! 
Come back!” sh
outed Dólokhov.
 “Betrayed! Ba
ck!”  Dólok
"hov, after Anato"
"le entered, had "
remained at the 
wicket gate and 
was struggling 
with the yard po
rter who was try
ing to lock it. 
With a last des
perate effort D�
�lokhov pushed t
"he porter aside,"
 and when Anatol
e ran back seiz
ed him by the ar
"m, pulled him th"
rough the wicket
", and ran back
"
with him to the 
troyka.     
  CHAPTER XVIII
  Márya Dmít
"rievna, having f"
ound Sónya weep
ing in the corri
"dor, made her
c"
onfess everythin
"g, and intercept"
ing the note to 
Natásha she rea
d it and went i
nto Natásha’s
 room with it in
 her hand.  �
�You shameless g
ood-for-nothing!
” said she. �
�I won’t hear 
a word.”  Pu
shing back Natá
sha who looked a
t her with aston
ished but tearle
"ss
eyes, she lo"
cked her in; and
 having given or
ders to the yard
 porter to admi
t the persons wh
o would be comin
"g that evening, "
but not to let t
"hem
out again, "
and having told 
the footman to b
ring them up to 
"her, she
seated"
 herself in the 
drawing room to 
await the abduct
ors.  When Gab
riel came to inf
orm her that the
 men who had com
e had run away 
"again, she rose "
"frowning, and cl"
asping her hands
 behind her pace
d through the r
ooms a long time
 considering wha
t she should do.
 Toward midnigh
t she went to Na
tásha’s room 
fingering the ke
y in her pocket.
 Sónya was sit
ting sobbing in 
the corridor. �
�Márya Dmítrie
"vna, for God’s"
 sake let me in
 to her!” she 
"pleaded, but Má"
rya Dmítrievna 
unlocked the do
or and went in w
ithout giving he
r an answer.... 
"“Disgusting,
"
abominable... In
 my house... hor
"rid girl, hussy!"
 I’m only sorr
y for her fathe
r!” thought sh
"e, trying to res"
train her wrath.
 “Hard as it m
"ay
be, I’ll t"
ell them all to 
hold their tongu
es and will hide
 it from the co
unt.” She ente
red the room wit
h resolute steps
. Natásha lying
" on the
sofa, h"
er head hidden i
"n her hands, and"
 she did not sti
r. She was in j
ust the same pos
ition in which M
árya Dmítrievn
a had left her. 
  “A nice gir
l! Very nice!”
 said Márya Dm�
�trievna. “Arr
anging meetings 
 with lovers in 
my house! It’s
 no use pretendi
ng: you listen w
hen I speak to 
you!” And Már
ya Dmítrievna t
ouched her arm. 
“Listen when I
 speak! You’v
e disgraced your
self like the lo
west of hussies.
 I’d treat you
"
differently, b"
ut I’m sorry f
"or your father, "
so I will concea
l it.”  Nat�
�sha did not cha
nge her position
", but her whole "
body heaved with
"
noiseless, con"
vulsive sobs whi
ch choked her. M
árya Dmítrievn
a glanced round
 at Sónya and s
eated herself on
 the sofa beside
 Natásha.  �
�It’s lucky fo
r him that he es
caped me; but I�
��ll find him!�
� she said in h
er rough voice. 
“Do you hear w
hat I am saying 
or not?” she a
dded.  She put
 her large hand 
under Natásha�
�s face and turn
ed it toward her
. Both Márya D
mítrievna and S
ónya were amaze

"ttered,

Márya Dmítriev
na’s hands wit
h a vicious effo

down again into

“I wish for yo

 “Suppose he

“Oh, let"

�  And she bur
st into sobs wit
h the despairing
 vehemence with 
which people be
wail disasters t

casioned. Márya
 Dmítrievna wa
s to speak again
 but Natásha cr
ied out:  “G
o away! Go away!
 You all hate an
d despise me!”
 and she threw h
erself back on 
the sofa.  Má
rya Dmítrievna 
went on admonish
ing her for some
" time, enjoining"
 on her that it
 must all be kep
t from her fathe
r and assuring h
er that nobody 
would know anyth
ing about it if 
only Natásha he
rself would unde
rtake to forget
 it all and not 
let anyone see t
hat something ha
d happened. Nat
ásha did not re
"ply, nor did she"
" sob any longer,"
 but she grew co
ld and had a sh
ivering fit. Má
rya Dmítrievna 
put a pillow und
"er her head,
co"
vered her with t
"wo quilts, and h"
erself brought h
er some lime-flo
"wer
water, but "
Natásha did not
 respond to her.
"

“Well, let"
" her sleep,” s"
aid Márya Dmít
rievna as she we
nt out of the ro
om supposing Na
tásha to be asl
eep.  But Nat�
�sha was not asl
eep; with pale f
ace and fixed wi
de-open eyes she
 looked straigh
t before her. Al
l that night she
 did not sleep o
r weep and did 
not speak to Só
nya who got up a
nd went to her s
everal times.  
 Next day Count 
Rostóv returned
 from his estate
 near Moscow in 
time for lunch 
as he had promis
ed. He was in ve
ry good spirits;
 the affair with
 the purchaser 
was going on sat
"isfactorily, and"
 there was nothi
ng to keep him 
any longer in Mo
"scow, away from "
the countess who
m he missed. Má
rya Dmítrievna
 met him and tol
d him that Natá
sha had been ver
y unwell the da
y before and tha
t they had sent 
"for the doctor, "
but that she was
 better now. Na
tásha had not l
eft her room tha
t morning. With 
compressed and 
parched lips and
" dry fixed eyes,"
 she sat at the 
"window, uneasily"
 watching the p
eople who drove 
past and hurried
ly glancing roun
d at anyone who
 entered the roo
m. She was evide
ntly expecting n
ews of him and 
that he would co
me or would writ
e to her.  Whe
n the count came
 to see her she 
turned anxiously
 round at the so
und of a man’
"s footstep, and "
then her face re
sumed its cold a
nd malevolent e
xpression. She d
id not even get 
up to greet him.
 “What is the 
matter with you
", my angel? Are "
you ill?” aske
d the count.  
After a moment�
�s silence Natá
sha answered: �
"�Yes, ill.”
"
 In reply to the
 count’s anxio
us inquiries as 
to why she was s
o dejected and 
whether anything
 had happened to
" her betrothed, "
she assured him 
 that nothing ha
d happened and a
sked him not to 
worry. Márya Dm
ítrievna confi
rmed Natásha’
s assurances tha
t nothing had ha
ppened. From th
e pretense of il
"lness, from his "
daughter’s dis
"tress, and by th"
e embarrassed f
aces of Sónya a
nd Márya Dmítr
"ievna, the count"
 saw clearly th
at something had
 gone wrong duri
"ng his absence, "
but it was so te
rrible for him 
to think that an
ything disgracef
ul had happened 
to his beloved 
"daughter, and he"
 so prized his o
wn cheerful tran
"quillity, that h"
e avoided inqui
ries and tried t
o assure himself
 that nothing pa
rticularly had 
happened; and he
 was only dissat
isfied that her 
indisposition d
elayed their ret
urn to the count
ry.      C
HAPTER XIX  Fr
om the day his w
ife arrived in M
oscow Pierre had
 been intending 
to go away some
"where, so as not"
 to be near her.
 Soon after the 
Rostóvs came t
o Moscow the eff
ect Natásha had
 on him made him
 hasten to carry
 out his intent
ion. He went to 
Tver to see Jose
ph Alexéevich�
"�s widow, who
h"
ad long since pr
omised to hand o
ver to him some 
papers of her de
ceased husband�
��s.  When he 
returned to Mosc
ow Pierre was ha
nded a letter fr
om Márya Dmít
rievna asking hi
m to come and se
e her on a matte
r of great impo
rtance relating 
to Andrew Bolkó
nski and his bet
rothed. Pierre h
ad been avoidin
g Natásha becau
se it seemed to 
him that his fee
ling for her wa
s stronger than 
a married man’
s should be for 
his friend’s f
iancée. Yet so
me fate constant
ly threw them to
gether.  “Wh
at can have happ
ened? And what c
an they want wit
h me?” thought
 he as he dress
ed to go to Már
ya Dmítrievna�
�s. “If only P
rince Andrew wou
ld hurry up and
 come and marry 
her!” thought 
he on his way to
 the house.  O
n the Tverskóy 
Boulevard a fami
liar voice calle
d to him.  “
Pierre! Been bac
k long?” someo
ne shouted. Pier
re raised his he
ad. In a sleigh
 drawn by two gr
ay trotting-hors
es that were bes
pattering the d
ashboard with sn
"ow, Anatole and "
his constant com
panion Makárin 
dashed past. An
atole was sittin
g upright in the
 classic pose of
 military dandi
"es, the lower pa"
rt of his face h
idden by his bea
ver collar and h
is head slightl
y bent. His face
 was fresh and r
"osy, his white-p"
"lumed hat,
tilt"
"ed to one side, "
disclosed his cu
rled and pomaded
 hair besprinkle
d with powdery 
"snow.

“Yes,"
" indeed, that’"
"s a true sage,�"
� thought Pierre
. “He sees not
hing beyond the
 pleasure of the
" moment, nothing"
 troubles him an
d so he is alwa
"ys cheerful, sat"
"isfied, and sere"
ne. What wouldn�
��t I give to be
 like him!” h
e thought enviou
sly.  In Máry
a Dmítrievna’
s anteroom the f
ootman who helpe
d him off with h
is fur coat sai
d that the mistr
ess asked him to
 come to her bed
room.  When he
 opened the ball
room door Pierre
 saw Natásha si
tting at the wi
"ndow, with a thi"
"n, pale, and spi"
teful face. She 
glanced round at
" him,
frowned, "
and left the roo
m with an expres
sion of cold dig
nity.  “What
 has happened?�
"� asked Pierre, "
entering Márya 
Dmítrievna’s 
room.  “Fine
 doings!” answ
ered Dmítrievna
. “For fifty-e
ight years have 
I lived in this
 world and never
 known anything 
so disgraceful!�
��  And having
 put him on his 
honor not to rep
eat anything she
" told him,
Már"
ya Dmítrievna i
nformed him that
 Natásha had re
fused Prince And
rew without her
 parents’ know
ledge and that t
he cause of this
 was Anatole Ku
rágin into whos
e society Pierre
’s wife had th
rown her and wit
h whom Natásha
 had tried to el
ope during her f
ather’s absenc
"e, in order to b"
e married secre
tly.  Pierre r
aised his should
ers and listened
 open-mouthed to
 what was told 
"him, scarcely ab"
le to believe hi
s own ears. That
 Prince Andrew�
�s deeply loved
 affianced wife�
��the same Natá
sha Rostóva who
 used to be so 
charming—shoul
d give up Bolkó
nski for that fo
ol Anatole who w
as already secr
etly married (as
" Pierre knew), a"
nd should be so 
in love with him
 as to agree to
 run away with h
"im, was somethin"
g Pierre could n
ot conceive and
 could not imagi
ne.  He could 
not reconcile th
e charming impre
ssion he had of 
"Natásha, whom
"
he had known fro
"m a child, with "
this new concept
ion of her basen
"ess,
folly, and"
 cruelty. He tho
ught of his wife
. “They are al
l alike!” he 
"said to himself,"
 reflecting that
 he was not the 
only man unfortu
nate enough to 
be tied to a bad
 woman. But stil
l he pitied Prin
ce Andrew to th
e point of tears
 and sympathized
 with his wounde
"d pride, and the"
 more he pitied
 his friend the 
more did he thin
k with contempt 
and even with d
isgust of that N
atásha who had 
just passed him 
in the ballroom 
with such a loo
k of cold dignit
y. He did not kn
ow that Natásha
’s soul was o
verflowing with 
"despair, shame, "
"and humiliation,"
 and that it was
 not her fault 
that her face ha
ppened to assume
 an expression o
f calm dignity 
and severity.  
 “But how get 
married?” said
" Pierre, in answ"
er to Márya Dm�
�trievna. “He 
 could not marry
—he is married
!”  “Thing
s get worse from
 hour to hour!�
� ejaculated Má
rya Dmítrievna.
 “A nice yout
h! What a scound
rel! And she’s
 expecting him�
�expecting him 
since yesterday.
 She must be tol
d! Then at least
 she won’t go 
on expecting hi
m.”  After h
earing the detai
ls of Anatole’
s marriage from 
"Pierre, and givi"
ng vent to her 
anger against An
atole in words o
"f abuse, Márya "
Dmítrievna tol
d Pierre why she
 had sent for hi
m. She was afrai
d that the count
" or
Bolkónski,"
 who might arriv
"e at any moment,"
 if they knew of
 this affair (w
hich she hoped t
o hide from them
) might challeng
e Anatole to a d
"uel,
and she th"
erefore asked Pi
erre to tell his
 brother-in-law 
in her name to 
leave Moscow and
 not dare to let
 her set eyes on
 him again. Pier
re—only now r
ealizing the dan
ger to the old c
"ount, Nicholas, "
and Prince Andr
ew—promised to
 do as she wishe
d. Having briefl
y and exactly e
xplained her wis
"hes to him, she "
let him go to th
e drawing room. 
"

“Mind, the "
count knows noth
ing. Behave as i
f you know nothi
"ng either,”
s"
he said. “And 
I will go and te
ll her it is no 
use expecting hi
m! And stay to 
dinner if you ca
re to!” she ca
lled after Pierr
e.  Pierre met
" the old count, "
who seemed nervo
us and upset. Th
at morning Nat�
�sha had told hi
m that she had r
ejected Bolkóns
ki.  “Troubl
"es, troubles, my"
 dear fellow!”
 he said to Pier
re. “What trou
bles one has wi
th these girls w
ithout their mot

ret having come

"he’s

 God knows what!
" It’s hard, Co"
"unt, hard to man"
age daughters in
 their mother�
�s absence....�
�  Pierre saw 
that the count w
as much upset an
d tried to chang
"e the
subject, "
but the count re
turned to his tr
oubles.  Sóny
a entered the ro
om with an agita
ted face.  “
Natásha is not 
quite well; she�
��s in her room 
and would like t
o see you. Már
ya Dmítrievna i
s with her and s
he too asks you 
to come.”  �
"��Yes, you are a"
 great friend of
" Bolkónski’s,"
 no doubt she wa
nts to send him
" a message,” s"
aid the count. �
��Oh dear! Oh de
ar! How happy it
 all was!”  
 And clutching t
he spare gray lo
cks on his templ
es the count lef
t the room.  
When Márya Dmí
trievna told Nat
ásha that Anato
"le was married, "
Natásha did no
t wish to believ
e it and insiste
d on having it c
onfirmed by Pier
re himself. Só
nya told Pierre 
this as she led 
him along the co
rridor to Natá
sha’s room.  
"
Natásha, pale "
"and stern, was s"
itting beside M�
�rya Dmítrievna
", and her
eyes,"
 glittering feve
"rishly, met Pier"
re with a questi
oning look the 
moment he entere
d. She did not s
"mile or nod, but"
 only gazed fixe
"dly at
him, and"
 her look asked 
only one thing: 
"was he a friend,"
 or like the ot
hers an enemy in
 regard to Anato
le? As for Pierr
"e, he evidently "
did not exist f
or her.  “He
 knows all about
" it,” said Má"
rya Dmítrievna 
pointing to Pier
re and addressi
ng Natásha. “
Let him tell you
 whether I have 
told the truth.�
��  Natásha l
ooked from one t
o the other as a
 hunted and woun

or her and loath
ing for the thin
"g he had to do, "
“whether it is

ould make no dif

because...”  
 “Then it is n
ot true that he�
��s married!” 
"

“Yes, it is"
 true.”  “
Has he been marr
ied long?” she
 asked. “On yo
ur honor?...” 
  Pierre gave h
is word of honor
.  “Is he st
ill here?” she
" asked, quickly."
"

“Yes, I ha"
ve just seen him
.”  She was 
evidently unable
 to speak and ma
de a sign with h
er hands that t
hey should leave
 her alone.   
    CHAPTER X
X  Pierre did 
not stay for din
"ner, but left th"
e room and went 
away at once. H
e drove through 
the town seeking
 Anatole Kurági
"n, at the though"
t of whom now t
he blood rushed 
to his heart and
 he felt a diffi
culty in breath
ing. He was not 
at the ice hills
", nor at the gyp"
"sies’, nor at"
 Komoneno’s. P
ierre drove to t
he Club. In the 
Club all was goi
ng on as usual.
 The members who
 were assembling
 for dinner were
 sitting about 
in groups; they 
greeted Pierre a
nd spoke of the 
town news. The f
ootman having g
"reeted him, know"
ing his habits a
nd his acquainta
"nces, told him
"
there was a plac
e left for him i
n the small dini
ng room and that
 Prince Michael
 Zakhárych was 
"in the library, "
but Paul Timofé
evich had not ye
t arrived. One 
of Pierre’s ac
"quaintances, whi"
le they were tal
king about the 
"weather, asked i"
f he had heard o
f Kurágin’s a
bduction of Rost
óva which was 
talked of in the
" town, and was i"
t true? Pierre l
aughed and said
 it was nonsense
 for he had just
 come from the R
ostóvs’. He a
sked everyone a
bout Anatole. On
e man told him h
e had not come y
"et, and
another"
 that he was com
ing to dinner. P
ierre felt it st
range to see thi
"s
calm, indiffe"
rent crowd of pe
ople unaware of 
what was going o
n in his soul. 
He paced through
" the ballroom, w"
aited till every
"one had come, an"
d as Anatole ha
d not turned up 
did not stay for
 dinner but drov
e home.  Anato
"le, for whom Pie"
"rre was looking,"
 dined that day 
"with Dólokhov,"
 consulting him 
as to how to rem
edy this unfortu
nate affair. It 
seemed to him e
ssential to see 
Natásha. In the
 evening he drov
e to his sister�
��s to discuss 
with her how to 
arrange a meetin
g. When Pierre r
eturned home af
ter vainly hunti
ng all over Mosc
"ow, his valet in"
formed him that 
Prince Anatole 
was with the cou
ntess. The count
ess’ drawing r
oom was full of 
 guests.  Pier
re without greet
ing his wife who
m he had not see
n since his ret
urn—at that mo
ment she was mor
e repulsive to h
im than ever—e
ntered the draw
ing room and see
ing Anatole went
 up to him.  �
"��Ah, Pierre,”"
 said the counte
ss going up to h
er husband. “Y
ou don’t know 
 what a plight o
ur Anatole...”
"

She stopped,"
 seeing in the f
orward thrust of
 her husband’s
" head, in his
g"
lowing eyes and 
his resolute gai
"t, the terrible "
indications of t
hat rage and st
rength which she
 knew and had he
rself experience
d after his due
l with Dólokhov
.  “Where yo
"u are, there is "
vice and evil!�
� said Pierre to
 his wife. “A
"natole, come wit"
h me! I must spe
"ak to you,” he"
 added in French
.  Anatole gla
nced round at hi
s sister and ros
"e submissively, "
ready to follow
" Pierre. Pierre,"
 taking him by t
"he arm, pulled h"
im toward himsel
f and was leadi
ng him from the 
room.  “If y
ou allow yoursel
f in my drawing 
room...” whisp
"ered Hélène, b"
ut Pierre did n
ot reply and wen
t out of the roo
m.  Anatole fo
llowed him with 
his usual jaunty
 step but his fa
ce betrayed anx
iety.  Having 
entered his stud
y Pierre closed 
the door and add
ressed Anatole 
without looking 
at him.  “Yo
u promised Count
ess Rostóva to 
marry her and we
re about to elop
"e with
her, is "
that so?”  �
"��Mon cher,” a"
nswered Anatole 
(their whole con
versation was in
" French),
“I "
don’t consider
 myself bound to
 answer question
s put to me in t
hat tone.”  
 Pierre’s face
", already pale, "
became distorted
 by fury. He sei
zed Anatole by 
the collar of hi
s uniform with h
is big hand and 
shook him from s
ide to side til
l Anatole’s fa
ce showed a suff
icient degree of
 terror.  “W
hen I tell you t
hat I must talk 
to you!...” re
peated Pierre. 
"
“Come now, t"
his is stupid. W
hat?” said Ana
"tole, fingering "
a button of his
 collar that had
 been wrenched l
oose with a bit 
of the cloth.  
 “You’re a s
coundrel and a b

 don’t know wh

from the pleasur
e of smashing yo
ur head with thi

"e,

 a heavy paperwe

it threateningly

t it back in it

  “I... I did

��  Pierre int
errupted him.  
 “Have you any

erre in answer t
o a frightened

"� said he, as if"
 repeating a le

" “Secondly,”"
 he continued af
ter a short pau

erre paced the r
oom several time

 Anatole sat at

mastered his wra
th. “I don’t
 know that and d
"on’t want to,�"
"�� he
said, not"
 looking at Pier
re and with a sl
ight tremor of h
"is lower jaw,
�"
��but you have u
sed such words t
o me—‘mean�
� and so on—wh
ich as a man of 
 honor I can’t
 allow anyone to

re glanced at hi
m with amazement
", unable to unde"
rstand what he 
wanted.  “Th
ough it was têt
"e-à-tête,” A"
natole continued
", “still I can"
’t...”  �
�Is it satisfact
ion you want?”
 said Pierre iro
nically.  “Y
ou could at leas
t take back your
 words. What? If
 you want me to 
"do as
you wish,"
 eh?”  “I 
"take them back, "
I take them back
!” said Pierre
", “and I ask y"
ou to forgive m
e.” Pierre inv
oluntarily glanc
ed at the loose 
button. “And i
f you require m
oney for your jo
urney...”  A
natole smiled. T
he expression of
 that base and c
"ringing smile, w"
hich Pierre kne
w so well in his
" wife, revolted "
"him.

“Oh, v"
ile and heartles
s brood!” he e
"xclaimed, and le"
ft the room.  
Next day Anatole
 left for Peters
burg.      
 CHAPTER XXI  
Pierre drove to 
Márya Dmítriev
na’s to tell h
er of the fulfil
lment of her wi
sh that Kurágin
 should be banis
hed from Moscow.
 The whole house
 was in a state
 of alarm and co
mmotion. Natásh
"a was very ill, "
"having, as Máry"
a Dmítrievna t
old him in secre
"t, poisoned hers"
elf the night af
ter she had bee
n told that Anat
"ole was married,"
 with some arsen
ic she had steal
thily procured.
 After swallowin
g a little she h
ad been so frigh
tened that she 
woke Sónya and 
told her what sh
e had done. The 
necessary antido
tes had been ad
ministered in ti
me and she was n
ow out of danger
", though still s"
o weak that it 
was out of the q
uestion to move 
her to the count
"ry, and
so the "
countess had bee
n sent for. Pier
re saw the distr
"acted count, and"
"
Sónya, who ha"
d a tear-stained
" face, but he co"
uld not see Nat�
�sha.  Pierre 
dined at the clu
b that day and h
eard on all side
s gossip about 
the attempted ab
duction of Rost�
�va. He resolute
ly denied these 
"
rumors, assurin"
g everyone that 
nothing had happ
ened except that
 his brother-in
-law had propose
d to her and bee
n refused. It se
emed to Pierre 
that it was his 
duty to conceal 
the whole affair
 and re-establis
h Natásha’s 
reputation.  H
e was awaiting P
rince Andrew’s
 return with dre
ad and went ever
y day to the ol
d prince’s for
 news of him.  
 Old Prince Bolk
ónski heard all
 the rumors curr
ent in the town 
from Mademoisel
le Bourienne and
 had read the no
te to Princess M
ary in which Na
tásha had broke
n off her engage
ment. He seemed 
in better spirit
s than usual an
d awaited his so
n with great imp
atience.  Some
 days after Anat
ole’s departur
e Pierre receive
d a note from Pr
"ince
Andrew, in"
forming him of h
is arrival and a
sking him to com
e to see him.  
 As soon as he r
"eached Moscow, P"
rince Andrew had
 received from h
is father Natá
sha’s note to 
Princess Mary br
eaking off her e
ngagement (Made
moiselle Bourien
ne had purloined
 it from Princes
s Mary and given
 it to the old 
"prince), and he "
heard from him t
he story of Nat�
�sha’s elopem
"ent, with additi"
ons.  Prince A
ndrew had arrive
d in the evening
 and Pierre came
 to see him next
 morning. Pierr
e expected to fi
nd Prince Andrew
 in almost the s
ame state as Na
tásha and was t
herefore surpris
ed on entering t
he drawing room 
 to hear him in 
the study talkin
g in a loud anim
ated voice about
 some intrigue 
going on in Pete
rsburg. The old 
prince’s voice
 and another now
 and then inter
rupted him. Prin
cess Mary came o
ut to meet Pierr
"e. She
sighed, "
looking toward t
he door of the r
oom where Prince
" Andrew was,
ev"
idently intendin
g to express her
 sympathy with h
"is sorrow, but P"
ierre saw by he
r face that she 
was glad both at
 what had happen
ed and at the w
ay her brother h
ad taken the new
s of Natásha’
s faithlessness.
  “He says h
"e expected it,�"
� she remarked. 
“I know his pr
ide will not let
 him express hi
"s feelings, but "
still he has tak
"en it better, fa"
"r better,
than "
I expected. Evid
ently it had to 
be....”  “
But is it possib
le that all is r
eally ended?” 
asked Pierre.  
 Princess Mary l
ooked at him wit
h astonishment. 
She did not unde
rstand how he c
ould ask such a 
question. Pierre
 went into the s
tudy. Prince An
"drew, greatly ch"
anged and plainl
y in better heal
"th, but with a f"
resh horizontal
 wrinkle between
" his brows, stoo"
d in civilian dr
ess facing his 
father and Princ
"e Meshchérski, "
warmly disputing
 and vigorously 
 gesticulating. 
The conversation
 was about Sper�
�nski—the news
 of whose sudde
n exile and alle
ged treachery ha
d just reached M
oscow.  “Now
 he is censured 
and accused by a
ll who were enth
usiastic about h
"im
a month ago,"
” Prince Andre
"w was saying, �"
�and by those wh
o were unable to
 understand his
 aims. To judge 
a man who is in 
disfavor and to 
throw on him al
l the blame of o
ther men’s mis
takes is very ea
"sy, but I mainta"
in that if anyt
hing good has be
en accomplished 
in this reign it
 was done by hi
"m, by him alone."
”  He paused
 at the sight of
 Pierre. His fac
e quivered and i
mmediately assu
med a vindictive
 expression.  
“Posterity wil
l do him justice
",” he conclude"
"d, and at once t"
urned to Pierre
".

“Well, ho"
w are you? Still
 getting stouter
?” he said wit
"h animation, but"
 the new wrinkl
e on his forehea
d deepened. “Y
"es, I am well,�"
� he said in an
swer to Pierre�
"�s question, and"
 smiled.  To P
ierre that smile
 said plainly: �
"��I am well, but"
 my health is no
w of no use to 
anyone.”  Af
ter a few words 
to Pierre about 
the awful roads 
from the Polish 
"
frontier, about"
 people he had m
et in Switzerlan
d who knew Pierr
"e, and
about M."
" Dessalles, whom"
 he had brought 
from abroad to b
e his son’s t
"utor, Prince And"
rew again joined
 warmly in the c
onversation abou
t Speránski wh
ich was still go
ing on between t
he two old men. 
  “If there w
"ere treason, or "
proofs of secret
 relations with 
"Napoleon,
they "
would have been 
"made public,” "
he said with war
mth and haste. �
"��I do
not, and"
" never did, like"
 Speránski pers
"onally, but I li"
ke justice!” 
 Pierre now rec
ognized in his f
riend a need wit
h which he was o
nly too familia
"r, to get excite"
d and to have ar
guments about ex
traneous matters
 in order to st
ifle thoughts th
at were too oppr
essive and too i
ntimate. When P
rince Meshchérs
"ki had left, Pri"
nce Andrew took 
Pierre’s arm a
nd asked him in
to the room that
 had been assign
ed him. A bed ha
d been made up 
"there, and some "
open portmanteau
s and trunks sto
od about. Prince
 Andrew went to
 one and took ou
t a small casket
", from which he "
drew a packet w
rapped in paper.
 He did it all s
ilently and very
 quickly. He st
ood up and cough
ed. His face was
 gloomy and his 
lips compressed.
  “Forgive m
e for troubling 
you....”  Pi
erre saw that Pr
ince Andrew was 
going to speak o
"f Natásha, and "
his broad face 
expressed pity a
nd sympathy. Thi
s expression irr
itated Prince A
"ndrew, and in a "
"determined, ring"
"ing, and unpleas"
ant tone he cont
inued:  “I h
ave received a r
efusal from Coun
tess Rostóva an
d have heard rep
orts of your br
other-in-law hav
ing sought her h
"and, or somethin"
g of that kind.
 Is that true?�
�  “Both tru
"e and untrue,”"
 Pierre began; b
ut Prince Andrew
 interrupted him
.  “Here are
 her letters and
" her portrait,�"
� said he.  He
 took the packet
 from the table 
and handed it to
 Pierre.  “G
ive this to the 
countess... if y
ou see her.” 
 “She is very
" ill,” said Pi"
erre.  “Then
 she is here sti
ll?” said Prin
ce Andrew. “An
d Prince Kurági
n?” he added 
quickly.  “H
e left long ago.
 She has been at
 death’s door.
”  “I much
 regret her illn
"ess,” said Pri"
nce Andrew; and 
he smiled like h
"is
father, cold"
"ly, maliciously,"
 and unpleasantl
y.  “So Mons
ieur Kurágin ha
s not honored Co
untess Rostóva 
with his hand?�
� said Prince A
"ndrew, and he sn"
orted several ti
mes.  “He co
"uld not marry, f"
or he was marrie
"d already,” sa"
id Pierre.  Pr
ince Andrew laug
hed disagreeably
", again remindin"
g one of his fat
her.  “And w
here is your bro
"ther-in-law now,"
 if I may ask?�
� he said.  �
�He has gone to 
Peters... But I 
"don’t know,”"
 said Pierre.  
"
“Well, it doe"
"sn’t matter,�"
� said Prince An
drew. “Tell Co
untess Rostóva 
 that she was an
d is perfectly f
ree and that I w
ish her all that
 is good.”  
 Pierre took the
 packet. Prince 
"Andrew, as if tr"
ying to remember
 whether he had
 something more 
"to say, or waiti"
ng to see if Pie
rre would say a
"nything, looked "
fixedly at him. 
"

“I say, do "
you remember our
 discussion in P
etersburg?” as
"ked Pierre,
“"
about...”  �
"��Yes,” return"
ed Prince Andrew
 hastily. “I s
aid that a falle
n woman should 
"be forgiven, but"
 I didn’t say 
I could forgive 
her. I can’t.�
��  “But can
 this be compare
d...?” said Pi
erre.  Prince 
Andrew interrupt
ed him and cried
 sharply: “Yes
", ask her hand
"
"again, be magnan"
"imous, and so on"
"?... Yes, that w"
ould be very nob
"le, but
I am un"
able to follow i
n that gentleman
’s footsteps. 
If you wish to b
e my friend nev
er speak to me o
f that... of all
" that! Well, goo"
d-by. So you’
ll give her the 
packet?”  Pi
erre left the ro
om and went to t
he old prince an
d Princess Mary.
  The old man 
seemed livelier 
than usual. Prin
cess Mary was th
e same as alway
"s, but beneath h"
er sympathy for 
"her brother, Pie"
rre noticed her 
 satisfaction th
at the engagemen
t had been broke
n off. Looking a
t them Pierre r
ealized what con
tempt and animos
ity they all fel
t for the Rost�
"�vs, and that it"
 was impossible 
in their presenc
e even to mentio
n the name of h
er who could giv
e up Prince Andr
ew for anyone el
se.  At dinner
 the talk turned
" on the war, the"
 approach of whi
ch was becoming 
 evident. Prince
 Andrew talked i
"ncessantly, argu"
ing now with his
" father,
now wi"
th the Swiss tut
"or Dessalles, an"
d showing an unn
atural animation
",
the cause of "
which Pierre so 
well understood.
      CHAP
TER XXII  That
 same evening Pi
erre went to the
 Rostóvs’ to 
fulfill the comm
ission entruste
d to him. Natás
"ha was in bed, t"
he count at the 
"club, and Pierre"
",
after giving "
the letters to S
"ónya, went to M"
árya Dmítrievn
a who was inter
ested to know ho
w Prince Andrew 
had taken the ne
ws. Ten minutes 
 later Sónya ca
me to Márya Dm�
�trievna.  “
Natásha insists
 on seeing Count
 Peter Kirílovi
"ch,” said she."
  “But how? 
Are we to take h
im up to her? Th
e room there has
 not been tidie
d up.”  “N
"o, she has dress"
ed and gone into
 the drawing roo
"m,” said Sóny"
a.  Márya Dm�
�trievna only sh
rugged her shoul
ders.  “When
 will her mother
 come? She has w
orried me to dea
"th! Now mind, do"
n’t tell her 
everything!” s
aid she to Pierr
e. “One hasn�
�t the heart to 
"scold
her, she "
is so much to be
" pitied, so much"
 to be pitied.�
�  Natásha wa
s standing in th
e middle of the 
"drawing room, em"
"aciated, with
a"
" pale set face, "
but not at all s
hamefaced as Pie
rre expected to 
find her. When 
he appeared at t
he door she grew
" flurried, evide"
ntly undecided 
whether to go to
 meet him or to 
wait till he cam
e up.  Pierre 
hastened to her.
 He thought she 
would give him h
er hand as usua
"l; but she, step"
"ping up to him, "
"stopped, breathi"
"ng heavily, her "
arms hanging li
felessly just in
 the pose she us
ed to stand in w
hen she went to
 the middle of t
he ballroom to s
"ing, but with qu"
ite a different 
 expression of f
ace.  “Peter
" Kirílovich,”"
 she began rapid
"ly, “Prince Bo"
lkónski was you
r friend—is y
"our friend,” s"
he corrected her
self. (It seemed
 to her that ev
erything that ha
d once been must
 now be differen
t.) “He told m
e once to apply
 to you...”  
 Pierre sniffed 
as he looked at 
"her, but did not"
 speak. Till the
n he had reproa
ched her in his 
heart and tried 
"to despise her, "
but he now felt 
so sorry for he
r that there was
 no room in his 
soul for reproac
h.  “He is h
ere now: tell hi
m... to for... f
orgive me!” Sh
e stopped and b
reathed still mo
"re quickly, but "
did not shed tea
rs.  “Yes...
 I will tell him
",” answered Pi"
erre; “but...�
��  He did not
 know what to sa
y.  Natásha w
as evidently dis
mayed at the tho
ught of what he 
might think she 
 had meant.  �
"��No, I know all"
" is over,” she"
 said hurriedly.
" “No, that can"
 never be. I’
m only tormented
 by the wrong I 
have done him. T
ell him only tha
t I beg him to 
"forgive, forgive"
", forgive me for"
 everything....�
��  She trembl
ed all over and 
sat down on a ch
air.  A sense 
of pity he had n
ever before know
n overflowed Pie
rre’s heart. 
 “I will tell
" him, I will tel"
l him everything
" once more,” s"
aid Pierre. “
But... I should 
like to know one
 thing....”  
 “Know what?�
� Natásha’s e
yes asked.  �
�I should like t
"o know, did you "
love...” Pierr
e did not know h
ow to refer to 
Anatole and flus
hed at the thoug
ht of him—“d
id you love that
 bad man?”  
 “Don’t call
 him bad!” sai
d Natásha. “B
ut I don’t kno
"w, don’t know "
at all....” 
 She began to c
ry and a still g
reater sense of 
"pity, tenderness"
", and love
well"
ed up in Pierre.
 He felt the tea
rs trickle under
 his spectacles 
and hoped they 
would not be not
iced.  “We w
on’t speak of 
"it any more, my "
"dear,” said Pi"
"erre, and his ge"
"ntle,
cordial t"
one suddenly see
med very strange
 to Natásha.  
 “We won’t s
"peak of it, my d"
ear—I’ll tel
l him everything
; but one thing 
"
I beg of you, c"
onsider me your 
friend and if yo
"u want help, adv"
"ice,
or simply "
to open your hea
rt to someone—
"not now, but whe"
n your mind is 
clearer--think o
f me!” He took
 her hand and ki
ssed it. “I sh
all be happy if
 it’s in my po
wer...”  Pie
rre grew confuse
d.  “Don’t
 speak to me lik
e that. I am not
 worth it!” ex
claimed Natásha
 and turned to 
"leave the room, "
but Pierre held 
her hand.  He 
knew he had some
thing more to sa
y to her. But wh
en he said it he
 was amazed at 
his own words. 
"
“Stop, stop!"
 You have your w
hole life before
" you,” said he"
 to her.  “B
efore me? No! Al
l is over for me
",” she replied"
 with shame and 
 self-abasement.
  “All over?
” he repeated.
 “If I were no
"t myself, but th"
"e handsomest,
c"
"leverest, and be"
st man in the wo
"rld, and were fr"
"ee, I would this"
 moment ask on 
my knees for you
r hand and your 
love!”  For 
the first time f
or many days Nat
ásha wept tears
 of gratitude an
"d
tenderness, a"
nd glancing at P
ierre she went o
ut of the room. 
  Pierre too wh
en she had gone 
almost ran into 
"the anteroom, re"
straining tears
 of tenderness a
nd joy that chok
"ed him, and with"
out finding the 
 sleeves of his 
fur cloak threw 
it on and got in
to his sleigh. 
 “Where to no
"w, your excellen"
cy?” asked the
 coachman.  �
�Where to?” Pi
erre asked himse
lf. “Where can
 I go now? Surel
y not to the Cl
ub or to pay cal
ls?” All men s
eemed so pitiful
", so poor, in co"
mparison with t
his feeling of t
enderness and lo
ve he experience
d: in comparison
 with that soft
"ened, grateful, "
last look she ha
d given him thro
ugh her tears. 
  “Home!” s
"aid Pierre, and "
despite twenty-t
wo degrees of fr
ost Fahrenheit 
he threw open th
e bearskin cloak
 from his broad 
chest and inhale
d the air with 
joy.  It was c
lear and frosty.
 Above the dirty
", ill-lit street"
"s, above the
bl"
"ack roofs, stret"
ched the dark st
arry sky. Only l
ooking up at the
 sky did Pierre
 cease to feel h
ow sordid and hu
miliating were a
ll mundane thin
gs compared with
 the heights to 
which his soul h
ad just been rai
sed. At the ent
rance to the Arb
át Square an im
mense expanse of
 dark starry sk
y presented itse
lf to his eyes. 
Almost in the ce
"nter of it, abov"
e the Prechíst
"enka Boulevard, "
surrounded and s
prinkled on all 
sides by stars 
but distinguishe
d from them all 
by its nearness 
"to the earth, it"
"s white
light, "
and its long upl
"ifted tail, shon"
e the enormous a
nd brilliant co
met of 1812—th
e comet which wa
s said to porten
d all kinds of w
oes and the end
 of the world. I
"n Pierre, howeve"
"r, that comet wi"
th its long lum
inous tail arous
ed no feeling of
 fear. On the co
ntrary he gazed 
"
joyfully, his e"
yes moist with t
"ears, at this br"
ight comet which
", having
travel"
ed in its orbit 
with inconceivab
le velocity thro
ugh immeasurable
"
space, seemed "
suddenly—like 
an arrow piercin
g the earth—to
 remain fixed i
"n a chosen spot,"
 vigorously hold
ing its tail ere
"ct, shining and"
 displaying its 
white light amid
 countless other
 scintillating s
tars. It seemed
 to Pierre that 
this comet fully
 responded to wh

" soul, now bloss"

 BOOK NINE: 181

PTER I  From t
he close of the 
year 1811 an int
ensified arming 
and concentratin
g of the forces
 of Western Euro
"pe began, and in"
 1812 these forc
es—millions o
"f men, reckoning"
 those transport
ing and feeding 
the army—moved
 from the west 
eastwards to the
 Russian frontie
"r, toward which "
since 1811 Russi
an forces had b
een similarly dr
awn. On the twel
"fth of June, 181"
"2, the
forces o"
f Western Europe
 crossed the Rus
sian frontier an
"d war began,
th"
"at is, an event "
took place oppos
ed to human reas
on and to human 
 nature. Million
s of men perpetr
ated against one
 another such in
numerable crime
"s, frauds, treac"
"heries, thefts, "
"forgeries, issue"
s of false money
",
burglaries, i"
"ncendiarisms, an"
d murders as in 
whole centuries 
are not recorde
d in the annals 
of all the law c
ourts of the wor
"ld, but which
t"
hose who committ
ed them did not 
at the time rega
rd as being crim
es.  What prod
uced this extrao
rdinary occurren
ce? What were it
s causes? The h
istorians tell u
s with naïve as
surance that its
 causes were the
 wrongs inflict
ed on the Duke o
"f Oldenburg, the"
 nonobservance o
f the Continenta
"l
System, the a"
mbition of Napol
"eon, the firmnes"
"s of Alexander, "
the mistakes of
 the diplomatist
"s, and so on.
"
"
Consequently, i"
t would only hav
e been necessary
" for Metternich,"
"
Rumyántsev, o"
"r Talleyrand, be"
tween a levee an
d an evening par
"ty, to have
tak"
en proper pains 
and written a mo
"re adroit note, "
or for Napoleon 
to have written
 to Alexander: �
��My respected B
"rother, I consen"
t to restore th
e duchy to the D
uke of Oldenburg
”—and there 
would have been 
no war.  We ca
n understand tha
t the matter see
med like that to
 contemporaries.
 It naturally s
eemed to Napoleo
n that the war w
as caused by Eng
land’s intrig
ues (as in fact 
he said on the i
sland of St. Hel
ena). It natural
ly seemed to me
mbers of the Eng
lish Parliament 
that the cause o
f the war was N
apoleon’s ambi
tion; to the Duk
"e of Oldenburg, "
that the cause o
f the war was t
he violence done
 to him; to busi
nessmen that the
 cause of the w
ar was the Conti
nental System wh
ich was ruining 
Europe; to the g
enerals and old
 soldiers that t
he chief reason 
for the war was 
the necessity of
 giving them em
ployment; to the
 legitimists of 
that day that it
 was the need o
f re-establishin
g les bons princ
"ipes, and to the"
 diplomatists of
 that time that
 it all resulted
 from the fact t
hat the alliance
 between Russia
 and Austria in 
1809 had not bee
n sufficiently w
ell concealed f
"rom Napoleon, an"
d from the awkwa
rd wording of Me
morandum No. 178
. It is natural
 that these and 
a countless and 
infinite quantit
y of other reas
"ons, the number "
depending on the

o posterity who
 view the thing 
that happened in
 all its magnitu
de and perceive
 its plain and t
"errible meaning,"
 these causes se
em insufficient.
 To us it is in
comprehensible t
hat millions of 
Christian men ki
lled and tortur
ed each other ei
ther because Nap
oleon was ambiti
ous or Alexander
"
was firm, or b"
ecause England�
�s policy was as
tute or the Duke
 of Oldenburg w
ronged. We canno
t grasp what con
nection such cir
cumstances have
 with the actual
 fact of slaught
er and violence:
 why because the
 Duke was wrong
"ed, thousands of"
 men from the ot
her side of Euro
pe killed and r
uined the people
 of Smolénsk an

e killed by them

To us, thei"

ho are not histo
rians and are no
t carried away 
by the process o
f research and c
an therefore reg
ard the event w
ith unclouded co
"mmon sense, an i"
ncalculable numb
er of causes pre
sent themselves
. The deeper we 
delve in search 
of these causes 
the more of the

ach separate cau

ears to us equa
lly valid in its

false by its ins

pared to the mag
nitude of the ev
"ents, and by its"
 impotence—apa
rt from the coo
peration of all 
the other coinci
dent causes—to
 occasion the e
"vent. To us, the"
 wish or objecti
on of this or th
at French corpor
al to serve a s
econd term appea
rs as much a cau
se as Napoleon�
�s refusal to w
ithdraw his troo
ps beyond the Vi

f Oldenburg; fo
r had he not wis

and a "
thousandth corpo

"also refused, th"
ere would have 
been so many les
s men in Napoleo
n’s army and t
he war could not
 have occurred.
  Had Napoleon
 not taken offen

 that he should 
withdraw beyond
" the Vistula, an"
d not ordered hi
s troops to adva
"nce, there would"
 have been no w
ar; but had all 
his sergeants ob

 then also there
 could have been
 no war. Nor cou

uent dictatorsh

r all the things
 that produced t
he French Revol
"ution, and so on"
. Without each o
f these causes n
othing could hav
e happened. So 
all these causes
—myriads of ca
uses—coincided
 to bring it ab
out. And so ther
e was no one cau
se for that occu
"rrence, but it h"
ad to occur bec
ause it had to. 
"Millions of men,"
 renouncing thei
r human feeling
"s and reason, ha"
d to go from wes
t to east to sla
"y their fellows,"
 just as some c
enturies previou
sly hordes of me
n had come from 
the east to the
" west, slaying t"
heir fellows.  
 The actions of 
Napoleon and Ale
"xander, on whose"
 words the event
 seemed to hang
", were as little"
 voluntary as th
e actions of any
 soldier who was
 drawn into the
 campaign by lot
 or by conscript
ion. This could 
not be otherwis
"e, for in order "
that the will of
 Napoleon and Al
exander (on whom
 the event seem
ed to depend) sh
ould be carried 
"out, the concurr"
ence of innumer
able circumstanc
es was needed wi
thout any one of
 which the event
 could not have
 taken place. It
 was necessary t
hat millions of 
men in whose ha
nds lay the real
 power—the sol
"diers who fired,"
 or transported 
 provisions and 
guns—should co
nsent to carry o
ut the will of t
hese weak indiv
"iduals, and shou"
ld have been ind
uced to do so by
 an infinite num
ber of diverse 
and complex caus
es.  We are fo
rced to fall bac
k on fatalism as
 an explanation 
of irrational e
vents (that is t
"o say, events th"
e reasonableness
 of which we do 
 not understand)
. The more we tr
y to explain suc
h events in hist
"ory
reasonably,"
 the more unreas
onable and incom
prehensible do t
hey become to u
s.  Each man l
ives for himself
", using his free"
dom to attain hi
s personal aims
", and feels with"
 his whole being
 that he can now
 do or abstain f
rom doing this 
or that action; 
but as soon as h
"e has done it, t"
hat action perf
ormed at a certa
in moment in tim
e becomes irrevo
cable and belong
"s to
history, i"
n which it has n
ot a free but a 
predestined sign
ificance.  The
re are two sides

"every man, his i"

which is the mo

"is irrevocable, "
and its result c
oinciding in tim
e with the actio
ns of millions 
of other men ass
umes an historic
 significance. T
he higher a man 
 stands on the s

    CHAPTER I
I  On the twen
ty-ninth of May 
Napoleon left Dr
"esden, where he "
had spent three
 weeks surrounde
d by a court tha
t included princ
"es, dukes, kings"
",
and even an e"
mperor. Before l
"eaving, Napoleon"
 showed favor to
" the
emperor, k"
"ings, and prince"
s who had deserv
"ed it, reprimand"
ed the kings an
d princes with w
hom he was dissa
"tisfied, present"
ed pearls and di
amonds of his o
"wn—that is, wh"
ich he had taken
 from other king
s—to the Empre
"ss
of Austria, "
"and having, as h"
is historian tel
"ls us, tenderly "
embraced the Em
press Marie Loui
se—who regarde
d him as her hus
"band, though he "
had left anothe
r wife in Paris�
��left her griev
ed by the partin
g which she seem
ed hardly able 
to bear. Though 
the diplomatists
 still firmly be
lieved in the p
ossibility of pe
ace and worked z
ealously to that
" end, and though"
 the Emperor Na
poleon himself w
rote a letter to
" Alexander, call"
ing him Monsieu
"r mon frère, an"
d sincerely assu
red him that he 
did not want war
 and would alwa
ys love and hono
r him—yet he s
et off to join h
"is army,
and at"
 every station g
ave fresh orders
 to accelerate t
he movement of h
is troops from 
west to east. He
 went in a trave
ling coach with 
"six horses,
sur"
rounded by pages
", aides-de-camp,"
" and an escort, "
along the road t
"o
Posen, Thorn,"
" Danzig, and Kö"
nigsberg. At eac
h of these towns
 thousands of p
eople met him wi
th excitement an
d enthusiasm.  
 The army was mo
ving from west t
"o east, and rela"
ys of six horses
 carried him in
 the same direct
ion. On the tent
"h of June, * com"
ing up with the 
"
army, he spent "
the night in apa
rtments prepared
 for him on the 
estate of a Pol
ish count in the
 Vilkavisski for
est.      * Ol
d style.  Next
" day, overtaking"
" the army, he we"
nt in a carriage
" to the Niemen, "
"and,
changing i"
nto a Polish uni
"form, he drove t"
o the riverbank 
in order to sel
ect a place for 
the crossing.  
"
Seeing, on the "
"other side, some"
 Cossacks (les C
osaques) and the
 wide-spreading
 steppes in the 
midst of which l
ay the holy city
 of Moscow (Mos
"cou, la ville sa"
"inte), the capit"
al of a realm su
ch as the Scythi
a into which Al
exander the Grea
t had marched—
Napoleon unexpec
"tedly, and
cont"
rary alike to st
rategic and dipl
omatic considera
"tions, ordered a"
"n
advance, and "
the next day his
 army began to c
ross the Niemen.
  Early in the
 morning of the 
twelfth of June 
he came out of h
"is tent,
which "
was pitched that
 day on the stee
p left bank of t
"he Niemen, and
"
looked through a
 spyglass at the
 streams of his 
troops pouring o
ut of the Vilka
visski forest an
d flowing over t
he three bridges
 thrown across 
the river. The t
"roops, knowing o"
f the Emperor’
"s presence, were"
 on the lookout
" for him, and wh"
en they caught s
ight of a figure
 in an overcoat 
 and a cocked ha
t standing apart
 from his suite 
in front of his 
tent on the hil
"l, they threw up"
 their caps and 
shouted: “Vive
 l’Empereur!�
� and one after
 another poured 
in a ceaseless s
tream out of the
 vast forest th
at had concealed
" them and, separ"
"ating, flowed on"
 and on by the t
hree bridges to
 the other side.
  “Now we’
ll go into actio
"n. Oh, when he t"
akes it in hand 
"himself, things"
 get hot... by h
eaven!... There 
he is!... Vive l
’Empereur! So 
these are the s
teppes of Asia! 
It’s a nasty c
ountry all the s
"ame. Au revoir,"
 Beauché; I’l
l keep the best 
palace in Moscow
 for you! Au rev
oir. Good luck!
... Did you see 
the Emperor? Viv
e l’Empereur!.
.. preur!—If 
they make me Gov
"ernor of India, "
"Gérard, I’ll "
make you Ministe
r of Kashmir—
that’s settled
. Vive l’Emper
eur! Hurrah! hur
rah! hurrah! The
 Cossacks—tho
se rascals—see
 how they run! V
ive l’Empereur
"! There he
is, "
do you see him? 
I’ve seen him 
"twice, as I see "
you now. The lit
tle corporal...
 I saw him give 
the cross to one
 of the veterans
.... Vive l’E
mpereur!” came
 the voices of m
"en, old and youn"
"g, of most diver"
se characters a
nd social positi
ons. On the face
s of all was one
 common express
ion of joy at th
e commencement o
f the long-expec
ted campaign and
 of rapture and
 devotion to the
 man in the gray
 coat who was st
anding on the h
ill.  On the t
hirteenth of Jun
e a rather small
", thoroughbred A"
rab horse was b
rought to Napole
on. He mounted i
t and rode at a 
gallop to one of
 the bridges ov
"er the Niemen, d"
eafened continua
lly by incessant
 and rapturous 
acclamations whi
ch he evidently 
endured only bec
ause it was impo
ssible to forbi
d the soldiers t
o express their 
love of him by s
"uch shouting,
b"
ut the shouting 
which accompanie
d him everywhere
 disturbed him a
nd distracted h
im from the mili
tary cares that 
had occupied him
 from the time 
he joined the ar
my. He rode acro
ss one of the sw
aying pontoon b
ridges to the fa
"rther side, turn"
ed sharply to th
"e left, and gall"
oped in the dir
ection of Kóvno
", preceded by en"
"raptured, mounte"
d chasseurs of t
"he
Guard who, b"
reathless with d
"elight, galloped"
 ahead to clear 
a path for him 
through the troo
ps. On reaching 
the broad river 
"Víliya, he stop"
ped near a regi
ment of Polish U
hlans stationed 
by the river.  
 “Vivat!” sh
"outed the Poles,"
" ecstatically, b"
reaking their ra
nks and pressin
g against one an
other to see him
.  Napoleon lo
oked up and down
" the river, dism"
"ounted, and sat "
down on a log t
hat lay on the b
ank. At a mute s
"ign from him, a "
telescope was ha
nded him which 
he rested on the
 back of a happy
 page who had ru
"n up to him,
an"
d he gazed at th
e opposite bank.
 Then he became 
absorbed in a ma
p laid out on t
he logs. Without
 lifting his hea
d he said someth
"ing, and two of"
 his aides-de-ca
mp galloped off 
to the Polish Uh
lans.  “What
? What did he sa
y?” was heard 
in the ranks of 
the Polish Uhlan
s when one of t
he aides-de-camp
 rode up to them
.  The order w
as to find a for
d and to cross t
he river. The co
lonel of the Po
"lish Uhlans, a h"
"andsome old man,"
" flushed and, fu"
mbling in his sp
eech from excit
"ement, asked the"
 aide-de-camp wh
ether he would b
e permitted to 
swim the river w
ith his Uhlans i
nstead of seekin
g a ford. In evi
dent fear of re
"fusal, like a bo"
y asking for per
mission to get o
"n a horse, he
b"
egged to be allo
wed to swim acro
ss the river bef
ore the Emperor�
��s eyes. The a
ide-de-camp repl
ied that probabl
y the Emperor wo
uld not be disp
leased at this e
xcess of zeal. 
 As soon as the
 aide-de-camp ha
"d said this, the"
 old mustached o
"fficer,
with ha"
ppy face and spa
"rkling eyes, rai"
"sed his saber, s"
houted “Vivat!
"”
and, comman"
ding the Uhlans 
"to follow him, s"
purred his horse
 and galloped i
nto the river. H
e gave an angry 
thrust to his ho
"rse, which had g"
rown restive un
"der him, and plu"
nged into the wa
"ter, heading for"
 the deepest pa
rt where the cur
rent was swift. 
Hundreds of Uhla
ns galloped in a
fter him. It wa
s cold and uncan
ny in the rapid 
current in the m
iddle of the st
"ream, and the Uh"
lans caught hold
 of one another 
as they fell off
 their horses. 
Some of the hors
es were drowned 
and some of the 
men; the others 
 tried to swim o
"n, some in the s"
addle and some c
linging to their
 horses’ mane
s. They tried to
 make their way 
forward to the o
pposite bank and
",
though there "
was a ford one t
hird of a mile a
"way, were proud "
that they were 
swimming and dro
wning in this ri
ver under the ey
es of the man wh
o sat on the lo
g and was not ev
en looking at wh
at they were doi
ng. When the ai
"de-de-camp, havi"
ng returned and 
choosing an oppo
"rtune moment,
v"
entured to draw 
the Emperor’s 
attention to the
 devotion of the
 Poles to his p
"erson, the littl"
e man in the gra
y overcoat got u
"p and, having
s"
ummoned Berthier
", began pacing u"
p and down the b
"ank with him, gi"
ving him instru
ctions and occas
ionally glancing
 disapprovingly 
at the drowning
 Uhlans who dist
racted his atten
tion.  For him
 it was no new c
onviction that h
is presence in a
ny part of the 
"world, from Afri"
ca to the steppe
s of Muscovy ali
"ke, was enough t"
o dumfound peop
le and impel the
m to insane self
-oblivion. He ca
lled for his ho
rse and rode to 
his quarters.  
 Some forty Uhla
ns were drowned 
"in the river, th"
ough boats were 
sent to their a
ssistance. The m
ajority struggle
d back to the ba
nk from which t
hey had started.
 The colonel and
 some of his men
 got across and 
with difficulty
 clambered out o
n the further ba
nk. And as soon 
as they had got
" out, in their s"
oaked and stream
"ing clothes, the"
y shouted “Viv
at!” and look
ed ecstatically 
at the spot wher
e Napoleon had b
een but where he
 no longer was 
and at that mome
nt considered th
emselves happy. 
"

That evening,"
 between issuing
 one order that 
the forged Russi
an paper money 
prepared for use
 in Russia shoul
d be delivered a
s quickly as po
ssible and anoth
er that a Saxon 
"should be shot, "
on whom a letter

poleon also gave

HAPTER III  Th
e Emperor of Rus
"sia had, meanwhi"

na for more than
" a
month, revie"
wing troops and 
holding maneuver
s. Nothing was r
eady for the wa
r that everyone 
expected and to 
prepare for whic
h the Emperor ha
d come from Pet
ersburg. There w
as no general pl
an of action. Th
e vacillation b
etween the vario
us plans that we
re proposed had 
even increased a
fter the Empero
r had been at he
adquarters for a
 month. Each of 
the three armie
s had its own co
mmander in chief
", but there was "
no supreme comm
ander of all the
" forces, and the"
 Emperor did not
 assume that re
sponsibility him
self.  The lon
ger the Emperor 
remained in Víl
na the less did 
everybody—tire
d of waiting—
prepare for the 
war. All the eff
orts of those wh
o surrounded the
 sovereign seem
ed directed mere
ly to making him
 spend his time 
pleasantly and 
forget that war 
was impending. 
"
In June, after"
 many balls and 
fetes given by t
he Polish magnat
"es, by the
cour"
"tiers, and by th"
e Emperor himsel
"f, it occurred t"
o one of the Pol
ish aides-de-ca
mp in attendance
 that a dinner a
nd ball should b
e given for the
 Emperor by his 
aides-de-camp. T
his idea was eag
erly received. 
The Emperor gave
 his consent. Th
e aides-de-camp 
collected money 
by subscription
. The lady who w
as thought to be
 most pleasing t
o the Emperor w
as invited to ac
t as hostess. Co

  The very day
 that Napoleon i
ssued the order 
to cross the Nie
"men, and
his va"
"nguard, driving "
off the Cossacks
", crossed the Ru"
"ssian frontier,"
 Alexander spent
 the evening at 
the entertainmen
t given by his 
aides-de-camp at
 Bennigsen’s c
ountry house.  
 It was a gay an
d brilliant fete
. Connoisseurs o
f such matters d
eclared that ra

 beautiful women
 been assembled 
in one place. C

ual footing with
 the highest of 
those of his ow
n age. He was me
eting Hélène i
n Vílna after n
ot having seen h
er for a long t
ime and did not 
"recall the past,"
 but as Hélène
 was enjoying t
he favors of a v
ery important pe
rsonage and Bor�
�s had only rece
"ntly
married, t"
hey met as good 
friends of long 
standing.  At 
midnight dancing
 was still going
" on. Hélène, n"
ot having a suit
"able
partner, h"
erself offered t
o dance the mazu
rka with Borís.
 They were the 
third couple. Bo
"rís, coolly loo"
king at Hélène
’s dazzling ba
re shoulders wh
ich emerged from
" a dark, gold-em"
"broidered, gauze"
" gown, talked to"
 her of old acq
uaintances and a
"t the same time,"
 unaware of it h
imself and unno
"ticed by others,"
 never for an in
stant ceased to 
observe the Empe
ror who was in 
the same room. T
he Emperor was n
"ot dancing, he s"
tood in the doo
"rway, stopping n"
ow one pair and 
now another with
 gracious words 
which he alone 
knew how to utte
r.  As the maz
"urka began, Bor�"
�s saw that Adju
tant General Bal
"ashëv, one of
"
those in closest
 attendance on t
"he Emperor, went"
 up to him and c
ontrary to cour
t etiquette stoo
d near him while
 he was talking 
to a Polish lad
y. Having finish
ed speaking to h
"er, the Emperor "
looked inquiring
ly at Balashëv
" and, evidently "
understanding th
at he only acted
 thus because t
here were import
ant reasons for 
"so doing, nodded"
 slightly to the
 lady and turne
d to him. Hardly
 had Balashëv b
egun to speak be
fore a look of 
amazement appear
ed on the Empero
r’s face. He t
ook Balashëv by
 the arm and cr
ossed the room w
"ith him, unconsc"
iously clearing 
a path seven ya
rds wide as the 
people on both s
ides made way fo
r him. Borís no
ticed Arakchée
v’s excited fa
ce when the sove
reign went out w
ith Balashëv. 
Arakchéev looke
d at the Emperor
 from under his 
"brow and, sniffi"
ng with his red
" nose, stepped f"
orward from the 
crowd as if expe
cting the Empero
r to address hi
m. (Borís under
stood that Arakc
héev envied Bal
ashëv and was 
displeased that 
evidently import
ant news had rea
ched the Emperor
 otherwise than
 through himself
.)  But the Em
peror and Balash
ëv passed out i
nto the illumina
ted garden with
out noticing Ara
"kchéev who, hol"
ding his sword a
nd glancing wra
"thfully around, "
followed some tw
enty paces behin
d them.  All t
he time Borís w
as going through
 the figures of 
"the mazurka, he "
was worried by 
the question of 
what news Balash
ëv had brought 
and how he coul
d find it out be
fore others. In 
the figure in wh
ich he had to ch
oose two ladies
", he whispered t"
o Hélène that 
he meant to choo
se Countess Pot
"ocka who, he tho"
"ught, had gone o"
ut onto the vera
"nda, and glided "
over the parque
t to the door op
ening into the g
"arden, where, se"
eing Balashëv 
and the Emperor 
returning to the
" veranda, he sto"
od still. They w
ere moving towa
rd the door. Bor
"ís, fluttering "
as if he had not
 had time to wi
"thdraw, respectf"
ully pressed clo
se to the doorpo
st with bowed he
ad.  The Emper
"or, with the agi"
tation of one wh
o has been perso
nally affronted
", was finishing "
with these words
:  “To enter
 Russia without 
declaring war! I
 will not make p
eace as long as 
 a single armed 
enemy remains in
 my country!” 
It seemed to Bor
ís that it gav
e the Emperor pl
easure to utter 
these words. He 
was satisfied wi
th the form in 
which he had exp
ressed his thoug
"hts, but displea"
sed that Borís
 had overheard i
t.  “Let no 
one know of it!�
�� the Emperor a
dded with a frow
n.  Borís und
erstood that thi
s was meant for 
"him and, closing"
" his eyes,
slig"
htly bowed his h
ead. The Emperor
 re-entered the 
ballroom and re
mained there abo
ut another half-
hour.  Borís 
was thus the fir
st to learn the 
news that the Fr
ench army had c
rossed the Nieme
"n and, thanks to"
" this, was able "
to show certain 
 important perso
nages that much 
that was conceal
ed from others w
as usually know
"n to him, and by"
 this means he r
ose higher in th
eir estimation.
   The unexpe
cted news of the
 French having c
rossed the Nieme
n was particula
rly startling af
ter a month of u
nfulfilled expec
"tations, and at"
 a ball. On firs
t receiving the 
"news, under the "
influence of ind
ignation and re
sentment the Emp
eror had found a
 phrase that ple
"ased him, fully"
 expressed his f
"eelings, and has"
 since become fa
mous. On returni
ng home at two 
o’clock that n
ight he sent for
" his secretary, "
"Shishkóv, and t"
old him to writ
e an order to th
e troops and a r
escript to Field
 Marshal Prince
" Saltykóv, in w"
hich he insisted
 on the words be
ing inserted tha
t he would not 
make peace so lo
ng as a single a
rmed Frenchman r
emained on Russ
ian soil.  Nex
t day the follow
ing letter was s
ent to Napoleon:
  Monsieur mon
" frère,

Yest"
erday I learned 
"that, despite th"
e loyalty with w
hich I have kept
 my engagements
 with Your Majes
"ty, your troops "
have crossed the
 Russian fronti
"er, and I have t"
his moment recei
ved from Petersb
"urg a note, in
"
which Count Laur
iston informs me
", as a reason fo"
r this aggressio
"n, that
Your Ma"
jesty has consid
ered yourself to
 be in a state o
f war with me f
rom the time Pri
nce Kurákin ask
ed for his passp
orts. The reason
s on which the 
Duc de Bassano b
ased his refusal
 to deliver them
 to him would n
ever have led me
 to suppose that
 that could serv
e as a pretext f
or aggression. 
"In fact, the amb"
"assador, as he h"
imself has decla
"red, was
never "
authorized to ma
"ke that demand, "
and as soon as I
 was informed of
 it I let him k
now how much I d
isapproved of it
 and ordered him
 to remain at h
is post. If Your
 Majesty does no
t intend to shed
 the blood of ou
r peoples for s
uch a misunderst
"anding, and cons"
ents to withdraw
 your troops fr
om Russian terri
"tory, I will reg"
ard what has pas
sed as not havi

an understanding
 between us will
 be possible. In
 the contrary c
"ase, Your Majest"
"y, I shall see m"
yself forced to 
repel an attack
 that nothing on
 my part has pro
voked. It still 
depends on Your 
 Majesty to pres

om the calamity 
of another war.

CHAPTER IV  At
 two in the morn
ing of the fourt
"eenth of June, t"
"he Emperor, havi"
ng sent for Bal
ashëv and read 
him his letter t
"o Napoleon, orde"
red him to take
 it and hand it 
personally to th
e French Emperor
. When dispatchi
"ng
Balashëv, t"
he Emperor repea
ted to him the w
ords that he wou
ld not make pea
ce so long as a 
single armed ene
my remained on R
ussian soil and 
told him to tra
nsmit those word
s to Napoleon. A
lexander did not
 insert them in
 his letter to N
"apoleon, because"
 with his charac
teristic tact he
 felt it would 
be injudicious t
o use them at a 
moment when a la
st attempt at r
econciliation wa
"s being made, bu"
t he definitely 
instructed Balas
hëv to repeat 
them personally 
to Napoleon.  
Having set off i
n the small hour
s of the fourtee
"nth, accompanied"
 by a bugler an
"d two Cossacks, "
Balashëv reache
d the French out
posts at the vi
llage of Rykónt
"y, on the Russia"
n side of the Ni
"emen, by dawn. T"
here he was sto
pped by French c
avalry sentinels
.  A French no
ncommissioned of
ficer of hussars
", in crimson uni"
form and a shag
"gy cap, shouted "
to the approachi
ng Balashëv to 
halt. Balashëv 
did not do so a
"t once, but cont"
inued to advance
 along the road 
at a walking pa
ce.  The nonco
mmissioned offic
"er frowned and, "
muttering words 
"of abuse,
advan"
ced his horse’
s chest against 
"Balashëv, put h"
is hand to his s
"aber,
and shout"
ed rudely at the
 Russian general
", asking: was he"
 deaf that he d
id not do as he 
was told? Balash
ëv mentioned wh
o he was. The n
oncommissioned o
fficer began tal
king with his co
mrades about reg
imental matters
 without looking
 at the Russian 
general.  Afte
r living at the 
seat of the high
est authority an
"d power, after
"
conversing with 
the Emperor less
 than three hour
"s before, and in"
 general being 
accustomed to th
e respect due to
 his rank in the
" service, Balash"
ëv found it ve
ry strange here 
on Russian soil 
to encounter thi
"s hostile,
and "
still more this 
"disrespectful, a"
pplication of br
ute force to hi
mself.  The su
n was only just 
appearing from b
ehind the clouds
", the air was
f"
resh and dewy. A
 herd of cattle 
was being driven
 along the road 
from the villag
"e, and over the "
fields the larks
" rose trilling, "
one after anoth
"er, like bubbles"
 rising in water
.  Balashëv l
ooked around him
", awaiting the a"
rrival of an off
icer from the v
illage. The Russ
ian Cossacks and
 bugler and the 
French hussars l
ooked silently 
at one another f
rom time to time
.  A French co
lonel of hussars
", who had eviden"
tly just left hi
"s bed, came
rid"
ing from the vil
lage on a handso
me sleek gray ho
"rse, accompanied"
 by two hussars
". The officer, t"
"he soldiers, and"
 their horses al
l looked smart 
and well kept. 
 It was that fi
rst period of a 
campaign when tr
oops are still i
"n full
trim, al"
most like that o
f peacetime mane
"uvers, but with "
a shade of mart
ial swagger in t
"heir clothes, an"
d a touch of the
 gaiety and spir
it of enterpris
e which always a
ccompany the ope
ning of a campai
gn.  The Frenc
h colonel with d
ifficulty repres
"sed a yawn, but "
was polite and 
evidently unders
tood Balashëv�
�s importance. H
e led him past h
is soldiers and
 behind the outp
osts and told hi
m that his wish 
to be presented 
to the Emperor 
would most likel
y be satisfied i
"mmediately, as t"
he Emperor’s 
"quarters were, h"
"e believed, not "
far off.  They
 rode through th
e village of Ryk
"ónty, past teth"
ered French huss
"ar
horses, past"
 sentinels and m
en who saluted t
heir colonel and
 stared with cu
riosity at a Rus
"sian uniform, an"
d came out at th
e other end of t
he village. The
 colonel said th
at the commander
 of the division
 was a mile and
 a quarter away 
and would receiv
e Balashëv and 
conduct him to h
is destination.
  The sun had 
by now risen and
 shone gaily on 
the bright verdu
re.  They had 
hardly ridden up
" a hill, past a "
"tavern, before t"
hey saw a group 
 of horsemen com
ing toward them.
 In front of the
" group, on a bla"
ck horse with t
rappings that gl
ittered in the s
"un, rode a tall "
man with plumes 
 in his hat and 
black hair curli
ng down to his s
houlders. He wor
"e a red
mantle,"
 and stretched h
is long legs for
ward in French f
ashion. This man
 rode toward Ba
lashëv at a gal
"lop, his plumes "
flowing and his 
gems and gold l
ace glittering i
n the bright Jun
e sunshine.  B
alashëv was onl
y two horses’ 
length from the 
equestrian with 
"the
bracelets, "
"plumes, necklace"
"s, and gold embr"
"oidery, who was "
galloping towar
d him with a the
atrically solemn
" countenance, wh"
"en Julner, the
"
"French colonel, "
whispered respec
tfully: “The K
ing of Naples!�
"� It was,
in fa"
"ct, Murat, now c"
alled “King of
 Naples.” Thou
gh it was quite 
 incomprehensibl
e why he should 
be King of Naple
"s, he was called"
" so,
and was hi"
mself convinced 
"that he was so, "
and therefore as
sumed a more so
lemn and importa
nt air than form
erly. He was so 
sure that he rea
lly was the Kin
g of Naples that
" when, on the ev"
e of his departu
re from that ci
"ty, while walkin"
g through the st
reets with his w
"ife, some Italia"
ns called out t
o him: “Viva i
l re!” * he tu
rned to his wife
 with a pensive 
 smile and said:
 “Poor fellows
", they don’t k"
now that I am le
aving them tomo
rrow!”      
* “Long live t
he king.”   
 But though he f
irmly believed h
imself to be Kin
g of Naples and 
pitied the grie
f felt by the su
bjects he was ab
"andoning, latter"
"ly, after he had"
 been ordered t
o return to mili
tary service—a
nd especially si
nce his last in
terview with Nap
"oleon in Danzig,"
 when his august
 brother-in-law 
had told him: �
��I made you Kin
g that you shoul
d reign in my wa
"y, but not in
y"
ours!”—he ha
d cheerfully tak
en up his famili
"ar business, and"
—like a well-
fed but not over
fat horse that f
eels himself in 
harness and grow
s skittish betw
een the shafts�
�he dressed up i
n clothes as var
iegated and exp
ensive as possib
"le, and gaily an"
d contentedly ga
lloped along the
 roads of Polan
"d, without himse"
lf knowing why o
r whither.  On
 seeing the Russ
ian general he t
hrew back his he
"ad, with its lon"
g hair curling 
to his shoulders
", in a majestica"
lly royal manner
", and looked
in"
quiringly at the
 French colonel.
 The colonel res
pectfully inform
ed His Majesty 
of Balashëv’s
" mission, whose "
name he could no
t pronounce.  
“De Bal-machè
ve!” said the 
King (overcoming
 by his assuranc
e the difficult
y that had prese
nted itself to t
he colonel). “
Charmed to make
 your acquaintan
"ce, General!” "
"he added, with a"
 gesture of king
ly condescensio
n.  As soon as
 the King began 
to speak loud an
d fast his royal
 dignity instan
"tly forsook him,"
 and without not
icing it he pass
ed into his nat
ural tone of goo
d-natured famili
arity. He laid h
is hand on the 
withers of Balas
hëv’s horse a
nd said:  “W
"ell, General, it"
 all looks like 
"war,” as if re"
gretting a circu
mstance of whic
h he was unable 
to judge.  “
"Your Majesty,”"
 replied Balash�
"�v, “my master"
", the Emperor, d"
oes not desire 
war and as Your 
Majesty sees...�
�� said Balashë
"v, using the wor"
ds Your Majesty
 at every opport
"unity, with the "
affectation unav
oidable in freq
uently addressin
g one to whom th
e title was stil
l a novelty.  
Murat’s face b
eamed with stupi
d satisfaction a
s he listened to
 “Monsieur de
 Bal-machève.�
� But royauté o
blige! * and he 
felt it incumben
"t on
him, as a "
king and an ally
", to confer on s"
tate affairs wit
h Alexander’s 
 envoy. He dismo
"unted, took Bala"
"shëv’s arm, a"
nd moving a few 
steps away from
" his suite, whic"
h waited respect
"fully, began to "
pace up and down
"
with him, tryi"
ng to speak sign
ificantly. He re
ferred to the fa
ct that the Emp
eror Napoleon ha
d resented the d
emand that he sh
ould withdraw hi
s troops from P
"russia, especial"
ly when that dem
and became gener
ally known and 
the dignity of F
rance was thereb
y offended.   
   * “Royalty 
has its obligati
ons.”   Bal
ashëv replied t
hat there was �
�nothing offensi
ve in the demand
",
because...”"
 but Murat inter
rupted him.  �
��Then you don�
�t consider the 
Emperor Alexande
r the aggressor?
” he asked un
"expectedly, with"
 a kindly and fo
olish smile.  
Balashëv told h
im why he consid
ered Napoleon to
 be the originat
or of the war. 
"

“Oh, my dea"
r general!” Mu
rat again interr
"upted him, “wi"
th all my heart 
I wish the Empe
rors may arrange
 the affair betw
"een them, and th"
at the war begu
n by no wish of 
mine may finish 
as quickly as po
ssible!” said 
"he,
in the tone"
 of a servant wh
o wants to remai
n good friends w
ith another des
pite a quarrel b
etween their mas
ters.  And he 
went on to inqui
ries about the G
rand Duke and th
e state of his 
"health, and to r"
eminiscences of 
the gay and amus
ing times he had
 spent with him
 in Naples. Then
" suddenly, as if"
 remembering his
" royal dignity,"
 Murat solemnly 
"drew himself up,"
 assumed the pos
e in which he ha
d stood at his 
"coronation, and,"
 waving his righ
"t arm, said:

"
“I won’t det
"ain you longer, "
General. I wish 
success to your 
"mission,”
and"
 with his embroi
dered red mantle
", his flowing fe"
"athers, and his"
 glittering orna
"ments, he rejoin"
ed his suite who
 were respectful
ly awaiting him
.  Balashëv r
"ode on, supposin"
g from Murat’s
 words that he w
ould very soon 
be brought befor
e Napoleon himse
lf. But instead 
"of that, at the "
next village th
e sentinels of D
avout’s infant
ry corps detaine
d him as the pi
ckets of the van
"guard had done, "
and an adjutant 
of the corps co
"mmander, who was"
" fetched, conduc"
ted him into the
 village to Mars
hal Davout.  
    CHAPTER 
V  Davout was 
to Napoleon what
 Arakchéev was 
to Alexander—t
hough not a cow
ard like Arakch�
"�ev, he was as p"
"recise, as cruel"
", and as unable "
to express his 
devotion to his 
monarch except b
y cruelty.  In
 the organism of
 states such men
" are necessary, "
as wolves are n
ecessary in the 
organism of natu
"re, and they alw"
"ays exist, alway"
s appear and ho
"ld their own, ho"
wever incongruou
s their presence
 and their prox
imity to the hea
d of the governm
ent may be. This
 inevitability a
lone can explai
n how the cruel 
"Arakchéev, who "
tore out a grena
dier’s mustach
e with his own 
"hands, whose wea"
k nerves rendere
d him unable to 
"face
danger, an"
d who was neithe
r an educated ma
n nor a courtier
", was able to
m"
aintain his powe
rful position wi
"th Alexander, wh"
ose own characte
r was chivalrou
"s, noble, and ge"
ntle.  Balash�
�v found Davout 
seated on a barr
el in the shed o
f a peasant’s 
"hut,
writing—"
he was auditing 
accounts. Better
 quarters could 
have been found
" him, but Marsha"
l Davout was one
 of those men wh
o purposely put 
 themselves in m
ost depressing c
onditions to hav
e a justificatio
n for being glo
omy. For the sam
e reason they ar
e always hard at
 work and in a 
hurry. “How ca
n I think of the
 bright side of 
"life when, as yo"
"u see, I
am sit"
ting on a barrel
 and working in 
a dirty shed?”
 the expression 
of his face see
med to say. The 
chief pleasure a
nd necessity of 
"such men,
when "
they encounter a
nyone who shows 
"animation, is to"
 flaunt their ow
"n
dreary, persi"
stent activity. 
Davout allowed h
imself that plea
sure when Balas
hëv was brought
 in. He became s
till more absorb
ed in his task w
hen the Russian
 general entered
", and after glan"
cing over his sp
ectacles at Bal
"ashëv’s face,"
 which was anima
ted by the beaut
y of the morning
 and by his tal
"k with Murat, he"
 did not rise or
" even stir, but "
scowled still m
ore and sneered 
malevolently.  
 When he noticed
 in Balashëv’
s face the disag
reeable impressi
on this recepti
"on produced, Dav"
out raised his h
ead and coldly a
sked what he wa
nted.  Thinkin
g he could have 
been received in
 such a manner o
nly because Dav
out did not know
 that he was adj
utant general to
 the Emperor Al
exander and even
 his envoy to Na
"poleon, Balashë"
v hastened to in
form him of his
 rank and missio
n. Contrary to h
"is expectation, "
"Davout, after
h"
"earing him, beca"
me still surlier
 and ruder.  �
��Where is your 
dispatch?” he 
inquired. “Giv
e it to me. I wi
ll send it to t
he Emperor.” 
 Balashëv repl
ied that he had 
been ordered to 
hand it personal
ly to the Emper
or.  “Your E
mperor’s order
s are obeyed in 
"your army, but h"
"ere,” said Dav"
"out,
“you mus"
t do as you’re
 told.”  And
", as if to make "
the Russian gene
ral still more c
onscious of his 
 dependence on b
"rute force, Davo"
ut sent an adjut
ant to call the 
officer on duty
.  Balashëv t
ook out the pack
et containing th
e Emperor’s le
tter and laid it
 on the table (
made of a door w
ith its hinges s
till hanging on 
"it, laid
across"
 two barrels). D
avout took the p
acket and read t
he inscription. 
  “You are pe
rfectly at liber
ty to treat me w
ith respect or n
"ot,”
proteste"
"d Balashëv, “"
but permit me to
 observe that I 
have the honor t
o be adjutant g
eneral to His Ma
jesty....”  
Davout glanced a
t him silently a
nd plainly deriv
ed pleasure from
 the signs of a
gitation and con
fusion which app
eared on Balash�
�v’s face.  
“You will be t
reated as is fit
"ting,” said he"
" and, putting th"
e packet in his
" pocket, left th"
e shed.  A min
ute later the ma
rshal’s adjuta
"nt, de Castrès,"
 came in and con
ducted Balashë
v to the quarter
s assigned him. 
  That day he d
ined with the ma
"rshal, at the sa"
me board on the 
barrels.  Next
 day Davout rode
" out early and, "
after asking Bal
ashëv to come t
"o
him, perempto"
rily requested h
im to remain the
"re, to move on w"
ith the baggage
 train should or
ders come for it
" to move, and to"
 talk to no one 
 except Monsieur
 de Castrès.  
 After four days
" of solitude, en"
"nui, and conscio"
usness of his im
potence and ins
ignificance—pa
rticularly acute
 by contrast wit
h the sphere of 
 power in which 
he had so lately
 moved—and aft
er several march
es with the mar
shal’s baggage
 and the French 
"army, which occu"
pied the whole 
"district, Balash"
ëv was brought 
to Vílna—now 
occupied by the 
 French—throug
h the very gate 
by which he had 
left it four day
s previously. 
 Next day the i
mperial gentlema
"n-in-waiting, th"
e Comte de Turen
"ne, came
to Bal"
ashëv and infor
med him of the E
mperor Napoleon�
��s wish to hono
r him with an a
udience.  Four
" days before, se"
ntinels of the P
reobrazhénsk re
giment had stood
 in front of th
e house to which
 Balashëv was c
"onducted, and no"
w two French gr
enadiers stood t
here in blue uni
forms unfastened
 in front and wi
th shaggy caps 
"on their heads, "
and an escort of
 hussars and Uhl
ans and a brill
iant suite of ai
"des-de-camp, pag"
"es, and generals"
", who were waiti"
ng for Napoleon
" to come out, we"
re standing at t
"he porch, round "
his saddle hors
e and his Mamelu
"ke, Rustan. Napo"
leon received Ba
lashëv in the v
ery house in V�
�lna from which 
Alexander had di
spatched him on 
his mission.  
    CHAPTER 
VI  Though Bal
ashëv was used 
to imperial pomp
", he was amazed "
at the luxury a
nd magnificence 
of Napoleon’s 
court.  The Co
mte de Turenne s
howed him into a
 big reception r
oom where many 
"generals, gentle"
"men-in-waiting, "
and Polish magna
tes—several of
 whom Balashëv
 had seen at the
 court of the Em
peror of Russia�
��were waiting. 
 Duroc said that
 Napoleon would 
receive the Russ
ian general befo
re going for hi
s ride.  After
" some minutes, t"
he gentleman-in-
waiting who was 
on duty came int
o the great rec
"eption room and,"
 bowing politely
", asked Balashë"
v to follow him
.  Balashëv w
ent into a small
" reception room,"
 one door of whi
ch led into a s
"tudy, the very o"
ne from which th
e Russian Empero
r had dispatched
 him on his mis
sion. He stood a
" minute or two, "
waiting. He hear
d hurried foots
teps beyond the 
"door, both halve"
s of it were ope
ned rapidly; all
 was silent and
 then from the s
tudy the sound w
as heard of othe
"r steps,
firm a"
nd resolute—th
ey were those of
 Napoleon. He ha
d just finished 
 dressing for hi
"s ride, and wore"
" a blue uniform,"
 opening in fron
t over a white 
waistcoat so lon
g that it covere
d his rotund sto
"mach, white
lea"
ther breeches ti
ghtly fitting th
e fat thighs of 
"his short legs, "
and Hessian boo
ts. His short ha
ir had evidently
 just been brush
"ed, but one
loc"
k hung down in t
he middle of his
 broad forehead.
 His plump white
 neck stood out
 sharply above t
he black collar 
"of his uniform, "
and he smelled 
of Eau de Cologn
e. His full face
", rather young-l"
"ooking, with its"
 prominent chin
", wore a graciou"
s and majestic e
xpression of imp
erial welcome. 
  He entered br
"iskly, with a je"
rk at every step
 and his head sl
ightly thrown b
ack. His whole s
hort corpulent f
igure with broad
 thick shoulder
"s, and chest and"
 stomach involun
tarily protrudin
"g, had that
imp"
osing and statel
y appearance one
 sees in men of 
forty who live i
n comfort. It w
"as evident, too,"
 that he was in 
the best of spir
its that day. 
 He nodded in a
nswer to Balash�
�v’s low and r
"espectful bow, a"
nd coming up to
 him at once beg
an speaking like
 a man who value
s every moment o
f his time and 
does not condesc
end to prepare w
hat he has to sa
y but is sure h
e will always sa
y the right thin
g and say it wel
l.  “Good da
"y, General!” s"
aid he. “I hav
e received the l
etter you brough
t from the Empe
ror Alexander an
d am very glad t
o see you.” He
 glanced with h
is large eyes in
to Balashëv’s
 face and immedi
ately looked pas
t him.  It was
 plain that Bala
shëv’s person
ality did not in
terest him at al
l. Evidently on
ly what took pla
ce within his ow
n mind intereste
d him. Nothing 
outside himself 
had any signific
"ance for him, be"
cause everything
"
in the world, "
it seemed to him
", depended entir"
ely on his will.
"

“I do not,"
" and did not, de"
"sire war,” he "
"continued, “bu"
t it has been f
orced on me. Eve
n now” (he emp
hasized the word
) “I am ready 
to receive any 
explanations you
 can give me.”
  And he began
 clearly and con
cisely to explai
n his reasons fo
r dissatisfacti
on with the Russ
ian government. 
Judging by the c
almly moderate 
and amicable ton
e in which the F
rench Emperor sp
"oke, Balashëv
"
was firmly persu
aded that he wis
hed for peace an
d intended to en
ter into negoti
ations.  When 
"Napoleon, having"
 finished speaki
"ng, looked inqui"
ringly at the R
"ussian envoy, Ba"
lashëv began a 
speech he had pr
epared long befo
re: “Sire! Th
"e Emperor, my ma"
ster...” but t
he sight of the 
Emperor’s eyes
 bent on him co
nfused him. “Y
ou are flurried�
��compose yourse
lf!” Napoleon 
"
seemed to say, "
as with a scarce
ly perceptible s
mile he looked a
t Balashëv’s
 uniform and swo
rd.  Balashëv
 recovered himse
lf and began to 
speak. He said t
hat the Emperor
 Alexander did n
ot consider Kur�
�kin’s demand 
for his passport
s a sufficient 
cause for war; t
hat Kurákin had
 acted on his ow
n initiative an
d without his so
vereign’s asse
"nt, that the Emp"
eror Alexander d
id not desire w
"ar, and had no r"
elations with En
gland.  “Not
 yet!” interpo
"sed Napoleon, an"
"d, as if fearing"
 to give vent to
" his
feelings, "
he frowned and n
odded slightly a
s a sign that Ba
lashëv might p
roceed.  After
 saying all he h
ad been instruct
"ed to say, Balas"
hëv added that 
 the Emperor Ale
xander wished fo
"r peace, but wou"
ld not enter int
o negotiations 
except on condit
ion that... Here
 Balashëv hesit
ated: he rememb
ered the words t
he Emperor Alexa
nder had not wri
tten in his let
"ter, but had spe"
cially inserted 
in the rescript 
to Saltykóv and
 had told Balas
hëv to repeat t
o Napoleon. Bala
shëv remembered
" these words,
�"
��So long as a s
ingle armed foe 
remains on Russi
"an soil,” but "
some complex fe
eling restrained
 him. He could n
"ot utter them, t"
hough he wished
 to do so. He gr
ew confused and 
said: “On cond
ition that the 
French army reti
res beyond the N
iemen.”  Nap
oleon noticed Ba
lashëv’s emba
rrassment when u
ttering these la
st words; his f
ace twitched and
 the calf of his
 left leg began 
to quiver rhyth
mically. Without
 moving from whe
re he stood he b
egan speaking in
 a louder tone 
and more hurried
ly than before. 
During the speec
h that followed
", Balashëv, who"
 more than once 
lowered his eyes
", involuntarily"
 noticed the qui
vering of Napole
on’s left leg 
which increased 
the more Napole
on raised his vo
ice.  “I des
"ire peace, no le"
ss than the Empe
"ror Alexander,�"
� he began. “H
ave I not for e
ighteen months b
een doing everyt
hing to obtain i
t? I have waite
d eighteen month
s for explanatio
ns. But in order
 to begin negot
"iations, what is"
 demanded of me?
"” he said, fro"
wning and making
 an energetic g
esture of inquir
y with his small
 white plump han
d.  “The wit
hdrawal of your 
army beyond the 
"Niemen, sire,”"
 replied Balash�
�v.  “The Ni
emen?” repeate
d Napoleon. “S
o now you want m
e to retire beyo
nd the Niemen�
�only the Niemen
?” repeated Na
"poleon, looking "
straight at Bal
ashëv.  The l
atter bowed his 
head respectfull
y.  Instead of
 the demand of f
our months earli
er to withdraw f
"rom Pomerania,
"
only a withdrawa
l beyond the Nie
men was now dema
nded. Napoleon t
urned quickly a
nd began to pace
 the room.  �
�You say the dem
and now is that 
I am to withdraw
 beyond the Niem
en before comme
ncing negotiatio
"ns, but in just "
the same way two
 months ago the
 demand was that
 I should withdr
aw beyond the Vi
stula and the Od
"er,
and yet you"
 are willing to 
negotiate.”  
 He went in sile
nce from one cor
ner of the room 
to the other and
 again stopped 
in front of Bala
shëv. Balashëv
 noticed that hi
s left leg was 
quivering faster
 than before and
 his face seemed
 petrified in it
s stern express
ion. This quiver
ing of his left 
leg was a thing 
Napoleon was co
nscious of. “T
he vibration of 
my left calf is 
a great sign wit
"h me,”
he rem"
arked at a later
 date.  “Suc
h demands as to 
retreat beyond t
he Vistula and O
der may be made 
to a Prince of 
"Baden, but not t"
o me!” Napoleo
n almost screame
"d, quite to his"
 own surprise. �
��If you gave me
 Petersburg and 
Moscow I could n
ot accept such 
conditions. You 
say I have begun
 this war! But w
ho first joined 
his army? The E
mperor Alexander
", not I! And you"
 offer me negoti
ations when I h
ave expended mil
"lions, when you "
are in alliance 
"with England, an"
d when your pos
ition is a bad o
ne. You offer me
 negotiations! B
ut what is the 
aim of your alli
ance with Englan
d? What has she 
given you?” he
 continued hurr
"iedly, evidently"
 no longer tryin
g to show the ad
vantages of peac
e and discuss i
"ts possibility, "
but only to prov
e his own rectit
ude and power a
nd Alexander’s
 errors and dupl
icity.  The co
mmencement of hi
s speech had obv
iously been made
 with the inten
tion of demonstr
ating the advant
ages of his posi
tion and showing
 that he was ne
vertheless willi
ng to negotiate.
 But he had begu
"n talking,
and "
the more he talk
ed the less coul
d he control his
 words.  The w
hole purport of 
his remarks now 
was evidently to
 exalt himself a
nd insult Alexa
nder—just what
 he had least de
sired at the com
mencement of th
e interview.  
“I hear you ha
ve made peace wi
th Turkey?”  
 Balashëv bowed
 his head affirm
atively.  “P
eace has been co
ncluded...” he
 began.  But N
apoleon did not 
let him speak. H
e evidently want
ed to do all the
 talking himsel
"f, and continued"
 to talk with th
e sort of eloque
nce and unrestr
ained irritabili
ty to which spoi
led people are s
o prone.  “Y
"es, I know you h"
ave made peace w
ith the Turks wi
thout obtaining 
 Moldavia and Wa
llachia; I would
 have given your
 sovereign those
 provinces as I
 gave him Finlan
"d. Yes,” he we"
"nt on, “I prom"
ised and would 
have given the E
mperor Alexander
 Moldavia and Wa
"llachia, and now"
 he won’t hav
e those splendid
 provinces. Yet 
he might have un
ited them to hi
s empire and in 
a single reign w
ould have extend
ed Russia from t
he Gulf of Both
nia to the mouth
s of the Danube.
 Catherine the G
reat could not 
"have done more,�"
�� said Napoleon
", growing more a"
nd more excited 
as he paced up 
and down the roo
"m, repeating to "
Balashëv almost
 the very words 
 he had used to 
Alexander himsel
f at Tilsit. “
"All that, he wou"
ld have owed to
 my friendship. 
"Oh, what a splen"
did reign!” he
 repeated severa
"l
times, then p"
"aused, drew from"
 his pocket a go
"ld snuffbox, lif"
ted it to his n
"ose, and greedil"
y sniffed at it.
  “What a sp
lendid reign the
 Emperor Alexand
er’s might hav
e been!”  He
 looked compassi
onately at Balas
"hëv, and as soo"
n as the latter 
tried to make s
ome rejoinder ha
stily interrupte
d him.  “Wha
t could he wish 
or look for that
 he would not ha
ve obtained thr
ough my friendsh
ip?” demanded 
"Napoleon, shrugg"
ing his shoulder
s in perplexity
". “But no, he "
has preferred to
 surround himsel
f with my enemi
"es, and with who"
"m? With Steins, "
"Armfeldts, Benni"
"gsens, and
Wint"
zingerodes! Stei
"n, a traitor exp"
elled from his o
wn country; Arm
"feldt, a rake an"
d an intriguer; 
"Wintzingerode, a"
 fugitive French
 subject; Benni
"gsen, rather mor"
e of a soldier t
"han the others, "
but all the sam
e an incompetent
 who was unable 
to do anything i
n 1807 and who 
should awaken te
rrible memories 
in the Emperor A
lexander’s min
d.... Granted t
hat were they co
mpetent they mig
ht be made use o
"f,” continued"
 Napoleon—hard
ly able to keep 
pace in words wi
th the rush of t
houghts that in
cessantly sprang
" up, proving how"
 right and stron
g he was (in his
 perception the
 two were one an
d the same)—�
�but they are no
t even that! Th
ey are neither f
it for war nor p
eace! Barclay is
 said to be the 
 most capable of
" them all, but I"
" cannot say so, "
judging by his f
irst movements.
 And what are th
"ey doing, all th"
ese courtiers? P
"fuel proposes,
"
Armfeldt dispute

tion.... And wha
t role is your y
oung monarch pl
aying in that mo
nstrous crowd? T
hey compromise h
im and throw on 
him the respons
ibility for all 
that happens. A 
sovereign should
 not be with th
e army unless he
 is a general!�
"� said Napoleon,"
 evidently utter
ing these words
 as a direct cha
llenge to the Em
peror. He knew h
ow Alexander de
sired to be a mi
litary commander
.  “The camp
aign began only 
"a week ago, and "
you haven’t ev
en been able to 
 defend Vílna. 
You are cut in t
wo and have been
 driven out of t
he Polish provi
nces. Your army 
is grumbling.”
  “On the co
"ntrary, Your Maj"
"esty,” said Ba"
"lashëv, hardly "
able to remember
 what had been 
said to him and 
following these 
verbal fireworks
 with difficult
"y, “the troops"
 are burning wit
h eagerness...�
�  “I know e
verything!” Na
poleon interrupt
ed him. “I kno
w everything. I 
 know the number
 of your battali
ons as exactly a
s I know my own.
 You have not t
wo hundred thous
"and men, and I h"
ave three times 
that number. I g
ive you my word
" of honor,” sa"
"id Napoleon, for"
getting that his
 word of honor 
could carry no w
eight—“I giv
e you my word of
 honor that I ha
ve five hundred
 and thirty thou
sand men this si
de of the Vistul
a. The Turks wil
l be of no use 
to you; they are
 worth nothing a
nd have shown it
 by making peac
e with you. As f
or the Swedes—
it is their fate
 to be governed 
by mad kings. T
heir king was in
sane and they ch
anged him for a
nother—Bernado
"tte, who promptl"
y went mad—for
 no Swede would 
ally himself wi
th Russia unless
 he were mad.”
  Napoleon gri
nned maliciously
 and again raise
d his snuffbox t
o his nose.  B
alashëv knew ho
w to reply to ea
ch of Napoleon�
"�s remarks, and "
would have done
 so; he continua
lly made the ges
ture of a man wi
shing to say so
"mething, but Nap"
oleon always int
errupted him. To
 the alleged ins
anity of the Sw
"edes, Balashëv "
wished to reply 
that when Russia
 is on her side 
 Sweden is pract
ically an island
: but Napoleon g
ave an angry exc
lamation to dro
wn his voice. Na
poleon was in th
at state of irri
tability in whic
h a man has to 
"talk, talk, and "
"talk, merely to "
convince himself
 that he is in 
the right. Balas
hëv began to fe
el uncomfortable
: as envoy he fe
ared to demean 
his dignity and 
felt the necessi
ty of replying; 
"but, as a man,
"
he shrank before
 the transport o
f groundless wra
th that had evid
ently seized Na
poleon. He knew 
that none of the
 words now utter
ed by Napoleon 
had any signific
"ance, and that N"
apoleon himself 
would be ashamed
 of them when h
e came to his se
nses. Balashëv 
stood with downc
"ast eyes, lookin"
g at the moveme
nts of Napoleon�
��s stout legs a
nd trying to avo
id meeting his 
eyes.  “But 
what do I care a
bout your allies
?” said Napole
on. “I have a
llies—the Pole
s. There are eig
hty thousand of 
them and they fi
ght like lions.
 And there will 
be two hundred t
housand of them.
”  And proba
bly still more p
erturbed by the 
fact that he had
 uttered this o
bvious falsehood
", and that Balas"
hëv still stood
 silently before
 him in the sam
e attitude of su
bmission to fate
", Napoleon abrup"
tly turned roun
"d, drew close to"
 Balashëv’s f
"ace, and, gestic"
ulating rapidly 
and energetical
ly with his whit
"e hands, almost "
shouted:  “K
now that if you 
stir up Prussia 
"against me, I’"
ll wipe it off t
he map of Europ
e!” he declare
"d, his face pale"
 and distorted b
"y anger, and he"
 struck one of h
is small hands e
nergetically wit
h the other. “
"Yes, I
will thr"
ow you back beyo
nd the Dvína an
d beyond the Dni
"eper, and will
"
re-erect against
 you that barrie
r which it was c
riminal and blin
d of Europe to 
allow to be dest
"royed. Yes, that"
 is what will ha
ppen to you. Th
at is what you h
ave gained by al
ienating me!” 
And he walked si
lently several 
times up and dow
"n the room, his "
fat shoulders tw
itching.  He p
ut his snuffbox 
into his waistco
"at pocket, took "
"it out again, li"
fted it several
 times to his no
"se, and stopped "
in front of Bala
shëv. He pause
"d, looked ironic"
ally straight in
to Balashëv’s
" eyes, and said "
in a quiet voic
e:  “And yet
 what a splendid
 reign your mast
er might have ha
d!”  Balash�
"�v, feeling it i"
ncumbent on him 
"to reply, said t"
hat from the Ru
ssian side thing
s did not appear
 in so gloomy a 
light. Napoleon 
"was
silent, sti"
ll looking deris
ively at him and
 evidently not l
istening to him
. Balashëv said
 that in Russia 
the best results
 were expected f
rom the war. Na
poleon nodded co
"ndescendingly, a"
"s if to say, “"
I know it’s y
our duty to say 
"that, but you do"
n’t believe it
 yourself. I hav
e convinced you
.”  When Bal
ashëv had ended
", Napoleon again"
 took out his sn
"uffbox, sniffed"
"
at it, and stam"
ped his foot twi
ce on the floor 
as a signal. The
" door
opened, a"
 gentleman-in-wa
"iting, bending r"
"espectfully, han"
ded the Emperor 
 his hat and glo
ves; another bro
ught him a pocke
t handkerchief. 
"Napoleon,
witho"
ut giving them a
" glance, turned "
to Balashëv:  
 “Assure the E
mperor Alexander
" from me,” sai"
"d he, taking his"
" hat, “that
I"
 am as devoted t
o him as before:
 I know him thor
oughly and very 
highly esteem h
is lofty qualiti
es. I will detai
"n you no longer,"
 General; you s
hall receive my 
letter to the Em
peror.”  And
 Napoleon went q
uickly to the do
or. Everyone in 
the reception ro
om rushed forwa
rd and descended
 the staircase. 
      CHAPT
ER VII  After 
all that Napoleo
n had said to hi
m—those bursts
 of anger and th
e last dryly sp
oken words: “I
 will detain you
" no longer, Gene"
ral; you shall 
receive my lette
"r,” Balashëv "
felt convinced t
hat Napoleon wou
ld not wish to 
"see him, and wou"
ld even avoid an
other meeting wi
th him—an ins
ulted envoy—es
pecially as he h
ad witnessed his
 unseemly anger.
" But,
to his su"
"rprise, Balashë"
"v received, thro"
"ugh Duroc, an in"
vitation to dine
 with the Emper
or that day.  
"Bessières, Caul"
"aincourt, and Be"
rthier were pres
ent at that dinn
er.  Napoleon 
met Balashëv ch
eerfully and ami
ably. He not onl
y showed no sign
 of constraint 
or self-reproach
 on account of h
is outburst that
" morning,
but, "
"on the contrary,"
 tried to reassu
re Balashëv. It
 was evident tha
t he had long b
een convinced th
at it was imposs
ible for him to 
"make a
mistake,"
 and that in his
 perception what
ever he did was 
"right, not
beca"
use it harmonize
d with any idea 
of right and wro
"ng, but because "
he did it.  T
he Emperor was i
n very good spir
its after his ri
de through Víln
"a, where
crowds"
 of people had r
apturously greet
ed and followed 
him. From all t
he windows of th
e streets throug
"h which he rode,"
" rugs, flags, an"
d his monogram 
"were displayed, "
and the Polish l
"adies, welcoming"
" him, waved
the"
ir handkerchiefs
 to him.  At d
"inner, having pl"
aced Balashëv b
"eside him, Napol"
eon not only tre
ated him amiabl
y but behaved as
 if Balashëv we
re one of his ow
"n courtiers,
on"
e of those who s
ympathized with 
his plans and ou
ght to rejoice a
t his success. 
In the course of
 conversation he
 mentioned Mosco
w and questione
d Balashëv abou
t the Russian ca
"pital, not merel"
y as an interes
ted traveler ask
s about a new ci
ty he intends to
" visit, but as
"
if convinced tha
"t Balashëv, as "
"a Russian, must "
be flattered by 
his curiosity. 
  “How many i
nhabitants are t
here in Moscow? 
How many houses?
 Is it true tha
t Moscow is call
ed ‘Holy Mosco
w’? How many c
hurches are ther
e in Moscow?”
 he asked.  An
d receiving the 
reply that there
 were more than 
two hundred chur
"ches,
he remark"
ed:  “Why su
ch a quantity of
 churches?”  
 “The Russians
 are very devout
",” replied Bal"
ashëv.  “Bu
t a large number
 of monasteries 
and churches is 
always a sign of
 the backwardne
"ss of a people,�"
�� said Napoleon
", turning to Cau"
laincourt for a
ppreciation of t
his remark.  B
alashëv respect
fully ventured t
o disagree with 
the French Emper
or.  “Every 
country has its 
"own character,�"
� said he.  �
�But nowhere in 
Europe is there 
anything like th
"at,” said Napo"
leon.  “I be
g your Majesty�
"�s pardon,” re"
turned Balashëv
", “besides Rus"
sia there is Sp
"ain, where there"
 are also many c
hurches and mona
steries.”  T
his reply of Bal
"ashëv’s, whic"
h hinted at the 
recent defeats o
f the French in
" Spain, was much"
 appreciated whe
n he related it 
at Alexander’s
"
court, but it "
was not much app
reciated at Napo
"leon’s dinner,"
 where it passe
d unnoticed.  
The uninterested
 and perplexed f
aces of the mars
hals showed that
 they were puzz
led as to what B
alashëv’s ton
e suggested. “
If there is a po
int we don’t 
"see it, or it is"
 not at all witt
"y,” their expr"
essions seemed 
to say. So littl
e was his rejoin
der appreciated 
that Napoleon di
d not notice it
 at all and naï
vely asked Balas
hëv through wha
t towns the dir
ect road from th
ere to Moscow pa
"ssed. Balashëv,"
 who was on the 
alert all throu
"gh the dinner, r"
eplied that just
 as “all roads
" lead to Rome,�"
� so all roads 
lead to Moscow: 
there were many 
"roads, and “am"
ong them the ro
ad through Polt�
"�va, which Charl"
es XII chose.”
 Balashëv invol
untarily flushe
d with pleasure 
at the aptitude 
"of this reply, b"
ut hardly had h
e uttered the wo
rd Poltáva befo
re Caulaincourt 
began speaking o
f the badness o
f the road from 
Petersburg to Mo
scow and of his 
Petersburg remi
niscences.  Af
ter dinner they 
went to drink co
ffee in Napoleon
"’s study, whic"
h four days pre
viously had been
 that of the Emp
eror Alexander. 
Napoleon sat do
"wn, toying with "
his Sèvres coff
"ee cup, and moti"
oned Balashëv t
o a chair besid
e him.  Napole
on was in that w
ell-known after-
dinner mood whic
"h, more than
an"
y reasoned cause
", makes a man co"
ntented with him
self and dispose
d to consider e
veryone his frie
nd. It seemed to
 him that he was
 surrounded by 
men who adored h
im: and he felt 
"convinced that, "
after his dinner
",
Balashëv too"
 was his friend 
and worshiper. N
apoleon turned t
o him with a pl
"easant, though s"
"lightly ironic, "
smile.  “The
y tell me this i
s the room the E
mperor Alexander
 occupied? Stran
"ge,
isn’t it,"
 General?” he 
"said, evidently "
not doubting tha
t this remark w
ould be agreeabl
e to his hearer 
since it went to
" prove his, Napo"
"leon’s,
super"
iority to Alexan
der.  Balashë
v made no reply 
and bowed his he
ad in silence. 
 “Yes. Four d
ays ago in this 
"room, Wintzinger"
ode and Stein we
re deliberating
",” continued N"
apoleon with the
 same derisive a
nd self-confide
nt smile. “Wha
t I can’t unde
"rstand,” he we"
"nt on, “is tha"
t the Emperor A
lexander has sur
rounded himself 
with my personal
 enemies. That 
I do not... unde
rstand. Has he n
ot thought that 
I may do the sam
e?” and he tu
rned inquiringly
" to Balashëv, a"
nd evidently thi
s thought turned
 him back on to
 the track of hi
s morning’s an
"ger, which was s"
till fresh in h
im.  “And le
t him know that 
I will do so!”
" said Napoleon, "
rising and pushi
ng his cup away
 with his hand. 
“I’ll drive 
all his Württem
"berg, Baden, and"
 Weimar relatio
ns out of German
y.... Yes. I’l
l drive them out
. Let him prepa
re an asylum for
 them in Russia!
”  Balashëv
 bowed his head 
with an air indi
cating that he w
ould like to ma
ke his bow and l
"eave, and only l"
istened because 
he could not hel
p hearing what 
was said to him.
 Napoleon did no
t notice this ex
pression; he tr
eated Balashëv 
not as an envoy 
"from his enemy, "
but as a man no
w fully devoted 
to him and who m
ust rejoice at h
is former master
’s humiliatio
n.  “And why
 has the Emperor
 Alexander taken
 command of the 
armies? What is 
 the good of tha
t? War is my pro
"fession, but his"
 business is to 
reign and not t
o command armies
! Why has he tak
en on himself su
ch a responsibi
lity?”  Agai
n Napoleon broug
ht out his snuff
"box, paced sever"
al times up and 
down the room i
"n silence, and t"
"hen, suddenly an"
"d unexpectedly, "
went up to Bala
shëv and with a
" slight smile, a"
"s confidently, q"
"uickly, and simp"
ly as if he wer
e doing somethin
g not merely imp
ortant but pleas
ing to Balashë
"v, he raised his"
 hand to the for
ty-year-old Russ
ian general’s 
"
face and, takin"
g him by the ear
", pulled it gent"
"ly, smiling with"
 his lips only.
  To have one�
��s ear pulled b
y the Emperor wa
s considered the
 greatest honor
 and mark of fav
or at the French
 court.  “We
"ll, adorer and c"
ourtier of the E
mperor Alexander
", why don’t yo"
u say anything?
"” said he, as "
if it was ridicu
"lous, in his pre"
"sence, to be the"
 adorer and cou
rtier of anyone 
"but himself, Nap"
oleon. “Are th
e horses ready 
for the general?
"” he added, wi"
th a slight incl
ination of his h
ead in reply to
 Balashëv’s b
ow. “Let him h
"ave mine, he has"
 a long way to 
go!”  The le
tter taken by Ba
lashëv was the 
last Napoleon se
nt to Alexander.
 Every detail o
f the interview 
was communicated
 to the Russian 
"monarch,
and th"
e war began.... 
      CHAPT
ER VIII  After
 his interview w
ith Pierre in Mo
"scow, Prince And"
rew went to Pet
"ersburg, on busi"
ness as he told 
"his family, but "
really to meet 
Anatole Kurágin
 whom he felt it
 necessary to en
counter. On reac
hing Petersburg
 he inquired for
 Kurágin but th
e latter had alr
eady left the c
ity. Pierre had 
warned his broth
er-in-law that P
rince Andrew was
 on his track. 
Anatole Kurágin
 promptly obtain
ed an appointmen
t from the Mini
ster of War and 
went to join the
 army in Moldavi
a. While in Pet
ersburg Prince A
ndrew met Kutúz
"ov, his former c"
ommander who was
 always well di
sposed toward hi
"m, and Kutúzov "
suggested that h
e should accomp
any him to the a
"rmy in Moldavia,"
 to which the ol
d general had b
een appointed co
mmander in chief
. So Prince Andr
"ew, having recei"
ved an appointm
ent on the headq
"uarters staff, l"
eft for Turkey. 
  Prince Andrew
 did not think i
t proper to writ
e and challenge 
Kurágin. He th
ought that if he
 challenged him 
without some fre
sh cause it migh
t compromise th
e young Countess
 Rostóva and so
 he wanted to me
et Kurágin per
sonally in order
 to find a fresh
 pretext for a d
uel. But he agai
n failed to mee
t Kurágin in Tu
"rkey, for soon a"
fter Prince Andr
"ew arrived,
the"
 latter returned
 to Russia. In a
" new country, am"
id new condition
"s,
Prince Andre"
w found life eas
ier to bear. Aft
er his betrothed
 had broken fai
th with him—wh
ich he felt the 
more acutely the
 more he tried t
o conceal its e
ffects—the sur
roundings in whi
ch he had been h
appy became try
"ing to him, and "
the freedom and 
independence he 
had once prized 
 so highly were 
still more so. N
ot only could he
 no longer think
 the thoughts t
hat had first co
me to him as he 
lay gazing at th
e sky on the fi
eld of Austerlit
z and had later 
enlarged upon wi
"th Pierre, and w"
hich had filled
 his solitude at
 Boguchárovo an
d then in Switze
"rland and Rome,"
 but he even dre
aded to recall t
hem and the brig
ht and boundless
 horizons they 
had revealed. He
 was now concern
ed only with the
 nearest practic
al matters unre
lated to his pas
"t interests, and"
 he seized on th
ese the more ea
gerly the more t
hose past intere
sts were closed 
to him. It was a
s if that lofty
", infinite canop"
y of heaven that
 had once towere
d above him had
 suddenly turned
" into a low, sol"
id vault that we
"ighed him down, "
in which all wa
"s clear, but not"
hing eternal or 
mysterious.  O
f the activities
 that presented 
themselves to hi
"m, army service "
was the simples
t and most famil
iar. As a genera
l on duty on Kut
"úzov’s staff,"
 he applied him
self to business
 with zeal and p
erseverance and 
surprised Kutú
zov by his willi
ngness and accur
acy in work. Not
 having found K
urágin in Turke
"y, Prince Andrew"
 did not think i
t necessary to r
ush back to Rus
"sia after him, b"
ut all the same 
he knew that how
ever long it mig
ht be before he
" met Kurágin, d"
espite his conte
mpt for him and 
despite all the
 proofs he deduc
ed to convince h
imself that it w
as not worth sto
oping to a conf
lict with him—
he knew that whe
n he did meet hi
m he would not 
be able to resis
t calling him ou
"t, any more than"
 a ravenous man 
can help snatch
ing at food. And
 the consciousne
ss that the insu
lt was not yet 
"avenged, that hi"
s rancor was sti
"ll unspent, weig"
hed on his heart
 and poisoned t
he artificial tr
anquillity which
 he managed to o
btain in Turkey
 by means of res
"tless, plodding,"
 and rather vain
glorious and am
bitious activity
.  In the year
" 1812, when news"
 of the war with
 Napoleon reache
d Bucharest—w
here Kutúzov ha
d been living fo
"r two months, pa"
ssing his days 
and nights with 
a Wallachian wom
an—Prince Andr
ew asked Kutúzo
v to transfer h
im to the Wester
n Army. Kutúzov
", who was alread"
y weary of Bolk
ónski’s activ
ity which seemed
 to reproach his
" own idleness, v"
ery readily let
 him go and gave
 him a mission t
o Barclay de Tol
ly.  Before jo
ining the Wester
n Army which was
" then, in May, e"
ncamped at Dris
"sa, Prince Andre"
w visited Bald H
ills which was d
irectly on his w
"ay,
being only "
two miles off th
e Smolénsk high
road. During the
 last three yea
rs there had bee
n so many change
"s in his life, h"
"e had thought, f"
"elt,
and seen s"
o much (having t
raveled both in 
the east and the
" west), that
on"
 reaching Bald H
ills it struck h
im as strange an
d unexpected to 
find the way of
 life there unch
anged and still 
the same in ever
y detail. He en
tered through th
e gates with the
ir stone pillars
 and drove up t
he avenue leadin
g to the house a
s if he were ent
ering an enchant
"ed,
sleeping ca"
stle. The same o
"ld stateliness, "
the same cleanli
"ness, the
same "
stillness reigne
"d there, and ins"
ide there was th
e same furniture
",
the same wall"
"s, sounds, and s"
"mell, and the sa"
"me timid faces, "
only somewhat o
lder. Princess M
ary was still th
"e same timid, pl"
ain maiden gett
"ing on in years,"
 uselessly and j
oylessly passing
 the best years 
of her life in 
fear and constan
t suffering. Mad
emoiselle Bourie
nne was the sam
"e coquettish, se"
lf-satisfied gir
"l, enjoying ever"
y moment of her 
 existence and f
ull of joyous ho
pes for the futu
re. She had mere
ly become more 
"self-confident, "
Prince Andrew th
ought. Dessalles
", the tutor he h"
ad brought from
" Switzerland, wa"
s wearing a coat
 of Russian cut 
and talking bro
ken Russian to t
"he servants, but"
 was still the s
ame narrowly in
"telligent, consc"
"ientious, and pe"
dantic preceptor
. The old prince
 had changed in
 appearance only
 by the loss of 
"a tooth, which l"
eft a noticeabl
e gap on one sid
e of his mouth; 
in character he 
was the same as 
"
ever, only show"
ing still more i
rritability and 
skepticism as to
 what was happe
ning in the worl
d. Little Nichol
as alone had cha
nged. He had gro
"wn,
become rosi"
"er, had curly da"
"rk hair, and, wh"
en merry and lau
"ghing, quite
un"
consciously lift
ed the upper lip
 of his pretty l
ittle mouth just
 as the little 
princess used to
 do. He alone di
d not obey the l
aw of immutabil
ity in the encha
"nted, sleeping c"
astle. But thoug
h externally al
l remained as of
" old, the inner "
relations of all
 these people ha
d changed since
 Prince Andrew h
ad seen them las
t. The household
 was divided in
to two alien and
" hostile camps, "
who changed thei
r habits for hi
s sake and only 
met because he w
as there. To the
 one camp belong
ed the old prin
"ce, Mademoiselle"
" Bourienne, and "
the architect; t
o the other Pri
"ncess Mary, Dess"
"alles, little Ni"
"cholas, and all "
the old nurses a
nd maids.  Du
ring his stay at
 Bald Hills all 
the family dined
" together, but t"
hey were ill at
 ease and Prince
 Andrew felt tha
t he was a visit
or for whose sa
ke an exception 
was being made a
nd that his pres
ence made them a
ll feel awkward
. Involuntarily 
feeling this at 
dinner on the fi
"rst day, he
was"
" taciturn, and t"
he old prince no
ticing this also
 became morosely
 dumb and retir
ed to his apartm
ents directly af
ter dinner. In t
"he evening,
whe"
n Prince Andrew 
"went to him and,"
 trying to rouse
" him, began to
"
tell him of the 
young Count Kám
ensky’s campai
"gn, the old prin"
ce began unexpe
ctedly to talk a
bout Princess Ma
"ry, blaming her "
for her superst
itions and her d
islike of Mademo
iselle Bourienne
", who, he said,"
 was the only pe
rson really atta
ched to him.  
The old prince s
aid that if he w
as ill it was on
ly because of Pr
incess Mary: th
at she purposely
 worried and irr
"itated him, and "
that by indulge
nce and silly ta
lk she was spoil
ing little Princ
e Nicholas. The 
 old prince knew
 very well that 
he tormented his
 daughter and th
at her life was
" very hard, but "
he also knew tha
t he could not h
elp tormenting 
her and that she
 deserved it. �
�Why does Prince
" Andrew, who see"
"s this,
say not"
hing to me about
 his sister? Doe
s he think me a 
"scoundrel, or an"
"
old fool who, "
without any reas
"on, keeps his ow"
n daughter at a 
distance and at
taches this Fren
chwoman to himse
lf? He doesn’t
" understand, so "
I must explain 
"it, and he must "
"hear me out,” "
thought the old 
prince. And he 
began explaining
 why he could no
t put up with hi
s daughter’s 
unreasonable cha
racter.  “If
" you ask me,” "
said Prince Andr
"ew, without look"
ing up (he was 
censuring his fa
ther for the fir
st time in his l
"ife), “I did n"
ot wish to spea
"k about it, but "
as you ask me I 
will give you my
 frank opinion. 
If there is any
 misunderstandin
g and discord be
tween you and Ma
"ry, I can’t
b"
lame her for it 
at all. I know h
ow she loves and
 respects you. S
ince you ask me
",” continued P"
"rince Andrew, be"
coming irritable
—as he was al
ways liable to d
o of late—“I
 can only say th
at if there are 
any misundersta
ndings they are 
caused by that w
"orthless woman, "
who is not fit 
to be my sister�
��s companion.�
�  The old man
 at first stared
 fixedly at his 
"son, and an unna"
tural smile dis
closed the fresh
 gap between his
 teeth to which 
Prince Andrew co
uld not get acc
ustomed.  “W
"hat companion, m"
y dear boy? Eh? 
You’ve already
 been talking it
 over! Eh?” 
"
“Father, I d"
id not want to j
"udge,” said Pr"
"ince Andrew, in "
a hard and bitt
"er tone, “but "
you challenged m
"e, and I have sa"
"id, and always s"
"hall
say, that "
Mary is not to b
"lame, but those "
to blame—the o
ne to blame—is
 that Frenchwom
"an.”

“Ah,"
 he has passed j
udgment... passe
d judgement!” 
said the old man
 in a low voice
" and, as it seem"
ed to Prince And
"rew, with some e"
"mbarrassment,
b"
ut then he sudde
nly jumped up an
d cried: “Be o
"ff, be off! Let "
not a trace of 
you remain here!
...”   Prin
ce Andrew wished
 to leave at onc
"e, but Princess "
Mary persuaded h
im to stay anot
her day. That da
y he did not see
" his father, who"
 did not leave 
his room and adm
itted no one but
 Mademoiselle Bo
urienne and Tí
"khon, but asked "
several times wh
ether his son ha
d gone. Next day
",
before leavin"
"g, Prince Andrew"
 went to his son
’s rooms. The 
"boy,
curly-head"
ed like his moth
er and glowing w
"ith health, sat "
"on his knee,
an"
d Prince Andrew 
began telling hi
m the story of B
"luebeard, but fe"
ll into a rever
ie without finis
hing the story. 
He thought not o
f this pretty c
"hild, his son wh"
om he held on hi
"s knee, but of h"
imself. He soug
ht in himself ei
ther remorse for
 having angered 
his father or re
gret at leaving
 home for the fi
rst time in his 
life on bad term
"s with him,
and"
 was horrified t
o find neither. 
What meant still
 more to him was
 that he sought
 and did not fin
d in himself the
 former tenderne
ss for his son 
which he had hop
ed to reawaken b
y caressing the 
boy and taking h
im on his knee.
"

“Well, go "
on!” said his 
son.  Prince A
"ndrew, without r"
"eplying, put him"
 down from his k
nee and went out
 of the room. 
 As soon as Pri
nce Andrew had g
iven up his dail
"y occupations, a"
nd especially o
n returning to t
he old condition
s of life amid w
hich he had bee
"n happy, wearine"
ss of life overc
ame him with its

"y,
and he haste"
ned to escape fr

s and to find so

 as possible.  
 “So you’ve

his sister.  �
��Thank God that

ed Prince Andrew
. “I am very s

  As soon as sh
e began to speak
" of that, her li"
ps trembled and 
her tears began
 to fall. Prince
 Andrew turned a
way and began pa
cing the room. 
"
“Ah, my God!"
 my God! When on

 what—what tra
sh—can cause 
people misery!�
� he said with a
 malignity that 
alarmed Princess
 Mary.  She un
derstood that wh
en speaking of �

ferred not only 
to Mademoiselle
" Bourienne, the "
cause of her mis
"ery, but also to"
 the man who ha
d ruined his own
 happiness.  �
��Andrew! One th
"ing I beg, I ent"
reat of you!” 
"she said, touchi"
ng his elbow an
d looking at him
 with eyes that 
shone through he
r tears. “I u
nderstand you”
 (she looked dow
n). “Don’t i
magine that sorr
ow is the work 
of men. Men are 
His tools.” Sh
e looked a littl
e above Prince 
Andrew’s head 
with the confide
"nt, accustomed l"
ook with which o
ne looks at the
 place where a f
amiliar portrait
 hangs. “Sorro
w is sent by Him
",
not by men. M"

 not to blame. I
f you think som

  “If I were

"do so, Mary. Tha"
t is a woman’s
 virtue. But a

" he replied, and"
 though till th
at moment he had
 not been thinki

all his unexpend

ly swelled up in
 his heart.  �
��If Mary is alr
eady persuading 
"me to forgive, i"
t means that I o
ught long ago t
o have punished 
"him,” he thoug"
ht. And giving h
er no further re
"ply,
he began t"
hinking of the g
lad vindictive m
oment when he wo
uld meet Kurág
in who he knew w

Mary begged him 
to stay one day

t she knew how

 Prince Andrew r
eplied that he w

 from the army 
and would certai

t the longer he
 stayed now the 
more embittered 
their difference

"

“Good-by, A"

that misfortunes

and men are nev

were the last wo
rds he heard fro
m his sister whe
n he took leave
 of her.  “T
hen it must be s

ince Andrew as h
e drove out of t
he avenue from 
the house at Bal
"d Hills. “She,"
 poor innocent c
"reature, is
lef"
t to be victimiz

 I myself don’

 so as to give h

s of the army at
 the end of Jun
e. The first arm
"y, with which wa"
"s the Emperor, o"
ccupied the fort
ified camp at D
rissa; the secon
d army was retre
"ating, trying to"
 effect a junct
ion with the fir
st one from whic
h it was said to
 be cut off by 
large French for
ces. Everyone wa
s dissatisfied w
ith the general 
course of affai
rs in the Russia
"n army, but no o"
ne anticipated a
ny danger of in
vasion of the Ru
"ssian provinces,"
 and no one thou
ght the war woul
d extend farthe
r than the weste
"rn, the Polish, "
provinces.  Pr
ince Andrew foun
d Barclay de Tol
"ly, to whom he h"
ad been assigned
", on
the bank o"
f the Drissa. As
 there was not a
 single town or 
large village i
n the vicinity o
"f the camp, the "
immense number o
f generals and 
courtiers accomp
anying the army 
were living in t
he best houses o
f the villages 
on both sides of
" the river, over"
 a radius of six
 miles. Barclay 
 de Tolly was qu
artered nearly t
hree miles from 
the Emperor. He 
received Bolkó
nski stiffly and
 coldly and told
 him in his fore
ign accent that 
he would mentio
n him to the Emp
eror for a decis
ion as to his em
"ployment,
but a"
sked him meanwhi
le to remain on 
his staff. Anato
"le Kurágin, who"
m Prince Andrew
 had hoped to fi
nd with the army
", was not there."
 He had gone to
" Petersburg, but"
 Prince Andrew w
as glad to hear 
this. His mind 
was occupied by 
the interests of
 the center that
 was conducting 
"
a gigantic war,"
 and he was glad
 to be free for 
a while from the
 distraction ca
used by the thou
ght of Kurágin.
 During the firs
"t four
days, wh"
ile no duties we
re required of h
"im, Prince Andre"
w rode round the
 whole fortifie
"d camp and, by t"
he aid of his ow
n knowledge and 
by talks with e
"xperts, tried to"
 form a definite
 opinion about i
t. But the ques
tion whether the
 camp was advant
ageous or disadv
antageous remain
ed for him unde
cided. Already f
rom his military
 experience and 
what he had see
n in the Austria
"n campaign, he h"
ad come to the c
onclusion that i
n war the most 
deeply considere
d plans have no 
significance and
 that all depen
ds on the way un
expected movemen
ts of the enemy�
��that cannot be
 foreseen—are
" met, and on how"
 and by whom the
 whole matter is
 handled. To cl
ear up this last
 point for himse
"lf, Prince Andre"
"w, utilizing his"
 position and a
"cquaintances, tr"
ied to fathom th
e character of t
he control of t
he army and of t
he men and parti
es engaged in it
", and he deduced"
 for himself th
e following of t
he state of affa
irs.  While th
e Emperor had st
ill been at Víl
"na, the forces h"
ad been divided 
 into three armi
"es. First, the a"
rmy under Barcla
"y de Tolly, seco"
"ndly, the
army "
under Bagratión
", and thirdly, t"
he one commanded
 by Tormásov. T
he Emperor was 
with the first a
"rmy, but not as "
commander in chi
ef. In the orde
rs issued it was
" stated, not tha"
t the Emperor wo
uld take command
",
but only that"
 he would be wit
h the army. The 
"Emperor, moreove"
"r, had
with him"
 not a commander
 in chief’s st
aff but the impe
rial headquarter
s staff. In att
endance on him w
as the head of t
he imperial staf
"f,
Quartermaste"
r General Prince
" Volkónski, as "
well as generals
", imperial
aide"
"s-de-camp, diplo"
"matic officials,"
 and a large num
ber of foreigner
"s,
but not the "
army staff. Besi
"des these, there"
 were in attenda
nce on the Empe
ror without any 
definite appoint
ments: Arakchée
"v, the ex-Minist"
er of War; Coun
"t Bennigsen, the"
 senior general 
in rank; the Gra
nd Duke Tsarév
ich Constantine 
Pávlovich; Coun
"t Rumyántsev, t"
he Chancellor; 
"Stein, a former "
Prussian ministe
"r; Armfeldt, a S"
wedish general; 
"Pfuel,
the chie"
f author of the 
plan of campaign
"; Paulucci, an a"
djutant general 
 and Sardinian �
�migré; Wolzoge
n—and many oth
ers. Though thes
e men had no mi
litary appointme
"nt in the army, "
their position g
ave them influen
"ce,
and often a"
 corps commander
", or even the co"
mmander in chief
", did not
know "
in what capacity
 he was question
"ed by Bennigsen,"
" the Grand Duke,"
"
Arakchéev, or"
 Prince Volkóns
"ki, or was given"
 this or that ad
vice and did no
t know whether a
 certain order r
eceived in the f
orm of advice em
anated from the
 man who gave it
 or from the Emp
eror and whether
 it had to be e
xecuted or not. 
But this was onl
y the external c
ondition; the es
sential signifi
cance of the pre
sence of the Emp
eror and of all 
"these people,
f"
rom a courtier�
�s point of view
 (and in an Empe
ror’s vicinity
 all became cou
"rtiers), was cle"
ar to everyone. 
It was this: the
 Emperor did not
 assume the tit
le of commander 
"in chief, but di"
sposed of all th
e armies; the m
en around him we
re his assistant
s. Arakchéev wa
s a faithful cu
stodian to enfor
ce order and act
ed as the sovere
ign’s bodyguar
d. Bennigsen wa
s a landlord in 
the Vílna provi
nce who appeared
 to be doing th
e honors of the 
"district, but wa"
s in reality a g
"ood general, use"
ful as an advis
er and ready at 
hand to replace 
Barclay. The Gra
nd Duke was the
re because it su
ited him to be. 
The ex-Minister 
Stein was there 
 because his adv
ice was useful a
nd the Emperor A
lexander held hi
m in high estee
m personally. Ar
mfeldt virulentl
y hated Napoleon
 and was a gener
al full of self
"-confidence, a q"
uality that alwa
ys influenced Al
exander. Pauluc
ci was there bec
ause he was bold
 and decided in 
speech. The adj
utants general w
ere there becaus
e they always ac
companied the E
"mperor, and last"
ly and chiefly P
fuel was there b
ecause he had dr
awn up the plan
 of campaign aga
inst Napoleon an
"d, having induce"
d Alexander to 
believe in the e
fficacy of that 
"plan, was direct"
ing the whole bu
siness of the w
ar. With Pfuel w
"as Wolzogen, who"
 expressed Pfuel
’s thoughts in
 a more compreh
ensible way than
 Pfuel himself (
"who was a harsh,"
 bookish theori
"st, self-confide"
nt to the point 
of despising eve
ryone else) was 
 able to do.  
Besides these Ru
ssians and forei
gners who propou
nded new and une
xpected ideas e
very day—espec
ially the foreig
"ners, who did so"
 with a boldness
 characteristic
 of people emplo
yed in a country
 not their own�
�there were man
y secondary pers
onages accompany
ing the army bec
ause their princ
ipals were ther
e.  Among the 
opinions and voi
ces in this imme
"nse, restless, b"
"rilliant,
and p"
"roud sphere, Pri"
nce Andrew notic
ed the following
 sharply defined
 subdivisions o
f tendencies and
 parties:  The
 first party con
sisted of Pfuel 
and his adherent
s—military the
orists who beli
eved in a scienc
e of war with im
mutable laws—l
aws of oblique 
"movements, outfl"
"ankings, and so "
forth. Pfuel and
 his adherents d
emanded a retir
ement into the d
epths of the cou
ntry in accordan
ce with precise 
 laws defined by
 a pseudo-theory
" of war, and the"
y saw only barba
"rism,
ignorance"
", or evil intent"
ion in every dev
iation from that
 theory. To thi
s party belonged
 the foreign nob
"les, Wolzogen, W"
"intzingerode, an"
"d
others, chief"
ly Germans.  T
he second party 
was directly opp
osed to the firs
"t; one extreme, "
as always happe
"ns, was met by r"
epresentatives o
f the other. The
 members of thi
s party were tho
se who had deman
ded an advance f
rom Vílna into 
Poland and free
dom from all pre
arranged plans. 
Besides being ad
vocates of bold 
"
action, this se"
ction also repre
sented nationali
"sm, which made t"
hem still more 
one-sided in the
 dispute. They w
ere Russians: Ba
"gratión, Ermól"
ov (who was beg
inning to come t
"o the front), an"
d others. At tha
t time a famous
 joke of Ermólo
v’s was being 
"circulated, that"
 as a great favo
r he had petiti
oned the Emperor
 to make him a G
erman. The men o
"f that party,
r"
emembering Suvó
"rov, said that w"
hat one had to d
o was not to rea
"son,
or stick p"
"ins into maps, b"
"ut to fight, bea"
"t the enemy, kee"
p him out of Ru
"ssia, and not le"
t the army get d
iscouraged.  T
o the third part
y—in which the
 Emperor had mos
t confidence—b
elonged the cou
rtiers who tried
 to arrange comp
romises between 
the other two. T
he members of t
"his party, chief"
ly civilians and
 to whom Arakch�
"�ev belonged,
t"
hought and said 
what men who hav
e no convictions
 but wish to see
m to have some 
generally say. T
hey said that un
"doubtedly war, p"
articularly aga
inst such a geni
us as Bonaparte 
(they called him
" Bonaparte now),"
 needs most dee
ply devised plan
s and profound s
cientific knowle
dge and in that
 respect Pfuel w
"as a genius, but"
 at the same tim
e it had to be 
acknowledged tha
t the theorists 
are often one-si
"ded, and therefo"
re one should n
ot trust them ab
"solutely, but sh"
ould also listen
 to what Pfuel�
�s opponents an
d practical men 
of experience in
 warfare had to 
"say, and
then c"
hoose a middle c
ourse. They insi
sted on the rete
ntion of the cam
"p
at Drissa, ac"
cording to Pfuel
"’s plan, but o"
n changing the m
ovements of the
 other armies. T
"hough, by this c"
"ourse, neither o"
ne aim nor the o
ther could be a
"ttained, yet it "
seemed best to t
he adherents of 
this third part
y.  Of a fourt
h opinion the mo
st conspicuous r
epresentative wa
s the Tsarévic
"h, who could not"
 forget his disi
llusionment at A
"usterlitz, where"
 he had ridden 
out at the head 
"of the Guards, i"
n his casque and
 cavalry unifor
m as to a review
", expecting to c"
rush the French 
gallantly; but 
unexpectedly fin
ding himself in 
the front line h
ad narrowly esca
ped amid the ge
neral confusion.
 The men of this
 party had both 
the quality and
 the defect of f
rankness in thei
r opinions. They
 feared Napoleon
",
recognized hi"
s strength and t
heir own weaknes
"s, and frankly s"
aid so. They sa
id: “Nothing b
"ut sorrow, shame"
", and ruin will "
come of all this
! We have aband
oned Vílna and 
Vítebsk and sha
ll abandon Driss
a. The only rea
sonable thing le
ft to do is to c
onclude peace as
 soon as possibl
"e,
before we ar"
e turned out of 
Petersburg.” 
 This view was 
very general in 
the upper army c
ircles and found
 support also i
n Petersburg and
 from the chance
"llor, Rumyántse"
"v, who, for othe"
r reasons of st
"ate, was in favo"
r of peace.  T
he fifth party c
onsisted of thos
e who were adher
ents of Barclay 
"de
Tolly, not s"
o much as a man 
but as minister 
of war and comma
nder in chief. 
“Be he what he
 may” (they al
ways began like 
"that), “he is "
"an
honest, prac"
tical man and we
 have nobody bet
ter. Give him re
"al power,
for w"
ar cannot be con
ducted successfu
lly without unit
"y of command, an"
d he will show 
"what he can do, "
as he did in Fin
land. If our arm
y is well organ
ized and strong 
and has withdraw
n to Drissa with
out suffering a
"ny defeats, we o"
we this entirely
 to Barclay. If 
Barclay is now t
o be superseded
 by Bennigsen al
"l will be lost, "
for Bennigsen sh
owed his incapa
city already in 
1807.”  The 
"sixth party, the"
" Bennigsenites, "
"said, on the con"
"trary, that at a"
ny rate there w
as no one more a
ctive and experi
enced than Benni
gsen: “and tw
ist about as you
" may, you will h"
ave to come to B
ennigsen eventua
lly. Let the ot
hers make mistak
es now!” said 
"they, arguing th"
at our retireme
nt to Drissa was
 a most shameful
 reverse and an 
unbroken series 
 of blunders. �
�The more mistak
es that are made
 the better. It 
will at any rat
e be understood 
all the sooner t
hat things canno
t go on like thi
s. What is want
ed is not some B
"arclay or other,"
 but a man like 
"Bennigsen,
who "
made his mark in
" 1807, and to wh"
om Napoleon hims
elf did justice�
��a man whose a
uthority would b
e willingly reco
"gnized, and Benn"
igsen is the on
ly such man.” 
  The seventh p
arty consisted o
f the sort of pe
ople who are alw
ays to be found
", especially aro"
und young sovere
"igns, and of who"
m there were pa
rticularly many 
round Alexander�
��generals and i
mperial aides-de
-camp passionat
ely devoted to t
"he Emperor, not "
merely as a mona
rch but as a ma
"n, adoring him s"
incerely and dis
"interestedly, as"
 Rostóv had don
"e
in 1805, and "
who saw in him n
ot only all the 
virtues but all 
human capabilit
ies as well. The
"se men, though e"
nchanted with th
e sovereign for
 refusing the co
mmand of the arm
"y, yet blamed hi"
m for such exces
"sive
modesty, a"
nd only desired 
and insisted tha
t their adored s
overeign should
 abandon his dif
fidence and open
ly announce that
 he would place 
 himself at the 
head of the army
", gather round h"
im a commander i
n chief’s sta
"ff, and, consult"
ing experienced 
theoreticians an
d practical men 
where necessary
", would himself "
"lead the troops,"
 whose spirits w
ould thereby be 
 raised to the h
ighest pitch.  
 The eighth and 
"largest group, w"
hich in its enor
mous numbers was
 to the others 
as ninety-nine t
"o one, consisted"
 of men who desi
red neither pea
"ce nor war, neit"
her an advance n
or a defensive c
amp at the Driss
a or anywhere e
"lse, neither Bar"
clay nor the Emp
"eror, neither Pf"
uel nor Bennigs
"en, but only the"
 one most essent
ial thing—as m
uch advantage a
nd pleasure for 
themselves as po
ssible. In the t
roubled waters o
f conflicting a
nd intersecting 
intrigues that e
ddied about the 
Emperor’s hea
"dquarters, it wa"
s possible to su
cceed in many wa
ys unthinkable a
t other times. 
A man who simply
 wished to retai
n his lucrative 
post would toda
y agree with Pfu
"el, tomorrow wit"
"h his opponent, "
and the day afte
"r,
merely to av"
oid responsibili
ty or to please 
"the Emperor, wou"
ld declare that
 he had no opini
on at all on the
 matter. Another
 who wished to 
gain some advant
age would attrac
t the Emperor’
s attention by l
oudly advocatin
g the very thing
 the Emperor had
 hinted at the d
"ay before,
and "
would dispute an
d shout at the c
"ouncil, beating "
his breast and 
challenging thos
e who did not ag
ree with him to 
"duels, thereby p"
roving that he 
was prepared to 
sacrifice himsel
f for the common
" good. A third,"
 in the absence 
"of opponents, be"
tween two counci
ls would simply 
solicit a speci
al gratuity for 
his faithful ser
"vices, well know"
ing that at that
 moment people 
would be too bus
y to refuse him.
 A fourth while 
seemingly overw
helmed with work
 would often com
e accidentally u
nder the Emperor
’s eye. A fif
"th, to achieve h"
is long-cherishe
d aim of dining 
with the Empero
"r, would stubbor"
nly insist on th
e correctness or
 falsity of some
 newly emerging
 opinion and for
 this object wou
ld produce argum
ents more or le
ss forcible and 
correct.  All 
the men of this 
party were fishi
"ng for rubles, d"
"ecorations, and"
"
promotions, and"
 in this pursuit
 watched only th
e weathercock of
 imperial favor
", and directly t"
hey noticed it t
urning in any di
"rection, this wh"
ole drone popul
ation of the arm
y began blowing 
"hard that way, s"
o that it was a
ll the harder fo
r the Emperor to
 turn it elsewhe
re. Amid the un
certainties of t
"he position, wit"
h the menace of 
serious danger g
iving a peculia
rly threatening 
character to eve
"rything, amid th"
is vortex of in
"trigue, egotism,"
 conflict of vie
"ws and feelings,"
 and the diversi
ty of race amon
g these people�
�this eighth and
 largest party o
f those preoccu
pied with person
al interests imp
arted great conf
usion and obscu
rity to the comm
on task. Whateve
r question arose
", a swarm of the"
"se
drones, with"
out having finis
hed their buzzin
g on a previous 
"theme, flew
ove"
r to the new one
 and by their hu
m drowned and ob
scured the voice
s of those who 
were disputing h
onestly.  From
 among all these
" parties, just a"
t the time Princ
e Andrew reached
"
the army, anot"
"her, a ninth par"
"ty, was being fo"
rmed and was beg
inning to raise
 its voice. This
 was the party o
"f the elders, re"
asonable men ex
perienced and ca
pable in state a
"ffairs, who, wit"
hout sharing any
 of those confl
"icting opinions,"
 were able to ta
ke a detached vi
ew of what was 
going on at the 
staff at headqua
rters and to con
sider means of 
escape from this
" muddle, indecis"
"ion, intricacy, "
and weakness.  
 The men of this
 party said and 
thought that wha
t was wrong resu
lted chiefly fr
om the Emperor�
�s presence in t
he army with his
 military court 
 and from the co
nsequent presenc
e there of an in
"definite, condit"
"ional,
and unst"
eady fluctuation
" of relations, w"
hich is in place
 at court but h
armful in an arm
y; that a sovere
ign should reign
 but not command
" the
army, and "
that the only wa
y out of the pos
ition would be f
or the Emperor 
and his court to
 leave the army;
 that the mere p
resence of the E
mperor paralyze
d the action of 
fifty thousand m
en required to s
ecure his perso
"nal safety, and "
that the worst c
ommander in chie
"f, if independen"
"t,
would be bet"
ter than the ver
y best one tramm
eled by the pres
ence and author
ity of the monar
ch.  Just at t
he time Prince A
ndrew was living
 unoccupied at D
"rissa,
Shishkó"
"v, the Secretary"
 of State and on
e of the chief r
epresentatives o
"f
this party, w"
rote a letter to
 the Emperor whi
ch Arakchéev an
d Balashëv agr
eed to sign. In 
"this letter, ava"
iling himself of
 permission give
n him by the Em
peror to discuss
 the general cou
"rse of affairs, "
he respectfully 
 suggested—on 
the plea that it
 was necessary f
or the sovereign
 to arouse a wa
rlike spirit in 
the people of th
e capital—that
 the Emperor sho
uld leave the a
rmy.  That aro
using of the peo
ple by their sov
ereign and his c
all to them to 
defend their cou
ntry—the very 
incitement which
 was the chief c
ause of Russia�
��s triumph in s
o far as it was 
produced by the 
Tsar’s persona
l presence in M
oscow—was sugg
ested to the Emp
"eror, and accept"
"ed by him, as
a"
 pretext for qui
tting the army. 
      CHAPT
ER X  This let
ter had not yet 
been presented t
o the Emperor wh
"en Barclay, one"
"
day at dinner, "
informed Bolkón
ski that the sov
ereign wished to
 see him person
"ally, to questio"
n him about Turk
"ey, and that Pri"
nce Andrew was t
o present himse
lf at Bennigsen�
��s quarters at 
six that evening
.  News was re
ceived at the Em
peror’s quarte
rs that very day
 of a fresh mov
ement by Napoleo
n which might en
danger the army�
��news subsequen
tly found to be
 false. And that
 morning Colonel
 Michaud had rid
den round the D
rissa fortificat
ions with the Em
peror and had po
inted out to him
 that this fort
ified camp const
"ructed by Pfuel,"
 and till then c
onsidered a che
f-d’oeuvre of 
tactical science
 which would ens
ure Napoleon’s
"
destruction, w"
"as an absurdity,"
 threatening the
 destruction of 
the Russian arm
y.  Prince And
rew arrived at B
ennigsen’s qua
rters—a countr
y gentleman’s 
 house of modera
"te size, situate"
d on the very ba
nks of the river
. Neither Benni
gsen nor the Emp
"eror was there, "
"but Chernýshev,"
 the Emperor’s
"
aide-de-camp, "
received Bolkón
ski and informed
 him that the Em
"peror,
accompan"
ied by General B
ennigsen and Mar
"quis Paulucci, h"
ad gone a second
 time that day 
to inspect the f
ortifications of
 the Drissa camp
", of the
suitab"
ility of which s
erious doubts we
re beginning to 
be felt.  Cher
nýshev was sitt
ing at a window 
in the first roo
m with a French 
novel in his ha
nd. This room ha
d probably been 
a music room; th
ere was still a
n organ in it on
 which some rugs
" were piled, and"
 in one corner s
tood the foldin
g bedstead of Be
nnigsen’s adju
tant. This adjut
ant was also th
ere and sat dozi
ng on the rolled
"-up bedding, evi"
dently exhausted
 by work or by 
feasting. Two do
ors led from the
" room, one strai"
ght on into wha
t had been the d
"rawing room, and"
" another, on the"
" right, to the s"
tudy. Through t
he first door ca
me the sound of 
voices conversin
g in German and
 occasionally in
 French. In that
 drawing room we
"re gathered, by"
 the Emperor’s
" wish, not a mil"
itary council (t
he Emperor prefe
rred indefinite
"ness), but certa"
in persons whose
 opinions he wis
hed to know in 
view of the impe
nding difficulti
es. It was not a
" council of war,"
" but,
as it wer"
"e, a council to "
elucidate certai
n questions for 
the Emperor per
sonally. To this
 semicouncil had
 been invited th
e Swedish Genera
"l
Armfeldt, Adj"
utant General Wo
"lzogen, Wintzing"
erode (whom Napo
leon had referr
ed to as a reneg

"ll, and Pfuel hi"
"mself, who, as P"
rince Andrew ha
"d heard, was the"
 mainspring of t
he whole affair.
 Prince Andrew 
had an opportuni
ty of getting a 
good look at him
", for Pfuel arri"
ved soon after 
"himself and, in "
passing through 
to the drawing r
"oom, stopped a
"
minute to speak 
to Chernýshev. 
  At first sigh
"t, Pfuel, in his"
 ill-made unifor
m of a Russian g
"eneral,
which f"
itted him badly 
like a fancy cos
"tume, seemed fam"
iliar to Prince 
"
Andrew, though "
he saw him now f
or the first tim
e. There was abo
ut him somethin
"g of Weyrother, "
"Mack, and Schmid"
"t, and many othe"
r German theori
st-generals whom
 Prince Andrew h
"ad seen in 1805,"
 but he was more
 typical than a
ny of them. Prin
ce Andrew had ne
ver yet seen a G
erman theorist 
in whom all the 
characteristics 
of those others 
were united to 
such an extent. 
  Pfuel was sho
rt and very thin
 but broad-boned
", of coarse, rob"
"ust build,
broa"
"d in the hips, a"
nd with prominen
t shoulder blade
s. His face was 
 much wrinkled a
nd his eyes deep
 set. His hair h
ad evidently bee
n hastily brush
ed smooth in fro
nt of the temple
"s, but stuck up "
behind in quaint
 little tufts. 
He entered the r
"oom, looking res"
tlessly and angr
"ily
around, as "
if afraid of eve
rything in that 
large apartment.
 Awkwardly hold
ing up his sword
", he addressed C"
hernýshev and a
sked in German w
here the Empero
r was. One could
 see that he wis
hed to pass thro
ugh the rooms a
s quickly as pos
"sible, finish wi"
th the bows and 
"greetings, and s"
it down to busi
ness in front of
" a map, where he"
 would feel at h
ome. He nodded 
hurriedly in rep
ly to Chernýshe
"v, and smiled ir"
onically on hear
ing that the so
vereign was insp
ecting the forti
fications that h
"e, Pfuel, had
p"
lanned in accord
 with his theory
. He muttered so
mething to himse
lf abruptly and
 in a bass voice
", as self-assure"
d Germans do—i
t might have be
en “stupid fel
low”... or “
the whole affair
" will be ruined,"
” or “somet
hing absurd will
 come of it.”.
.. Prince Andrew
 did not catch 
what he said and
 would have pass
"ed on, but Chern"
ýshev introduce
"d him to
Pfuel,"
 remarking that 
Prince Andrew wa
s just back from
 Turkey where th
e war had termi
nated so fortuna
tely. Pfuel bare
ly glanced—not
 so much at Pri
nce Andrew as pa
st him—and sai
"d, with a laugh:"
 “That must ha
ve been a fine 
tactical war”;
" and, laughing c"
"ontemptuously, w"
ent on into the 
room from which
 the sound of vo
ices was heard. 
"

Pfuel, always"
 inclined to be 
irritably sarcas
"tic, was particu"
larly disturbed
" that day, evide"
ntly by the fact
 that they had d
ared to inspect 
 and criticize h
is camp in his a
bsence. From thi
s short intervie
"w with
Pfuel, P"
"rince Andrew, th"
anks to his Aust
erlitz experienc
"es, was able to"
 form a clear co
nception of the 
man. Pfuel was o
ne of those hope
lessly and immu
tably self-confi
"dent men, self-c"
onfident to the 
point of martyr
dom as only Germ
"ans are, because"
 only Germans ar
e self-confident
 on the basis o
f an abstract no
"tion—science, "
"that is, the sup"
posed knowledge
 of absolute tru
th. A Frenchman 
is self-assured 
because he rega
rds himself pers
"onally, both in "
"mind and body, a"
s irresistibly 
attractive to me
n and women. An 
Englishman is se
"lf-assured, as b"
eing a citizen 
of the best-orga
nized state in t
"he world, and th"
erefore as an E
nglishman always
 knows what he s
hould do and kno
ws that all he d
oes as an Engli
shman is undoubt
edly correct. An
 Italian is self
-assured because
 he is excitabl
e and easily for
gets himself and
 other people. A
 Russian is sel
f-assured just b
ecause he knows 
nothing and does
 not want to kno
"w
anything, sin"
ce he does not b
elieve that anyt
hing can be know
n. The German�
�s self-assuranc
e is worst of al
"l, stronger and "
more repulsive 
"than any other, "
because he imagi
nes that he know
s the truth—s
cience—which h
e himself has in
vented but which
 is for him the 
 absolute truth.
  Pfuel was ev
idently of that 
sort. He had a s
cience—the the
ory of oblique 
movements deduce
d by him from th
e history of Fre
derick the Great
"’s wars,
and "
all he came acro
ss in the histor
y of more recent
 warfare seemed 
to him absurd a
nd barbarous—m
onstrous collisi
ons in which so 
many blunders w
ere committed by
 both sides that
 these wars coul
d not be called 
"wars,
they did "
not accord with 
"the theory, and "
therefore could 
not serve as ma
terial for scien
ce.  In 1806 P
fuel had been on
e of those respo
"nsible, for the "
plan of campaig
n that ended in 
Jena and Auerst�
"�dt, but he did "
not see the leas
t proof of the 
fallibility of h
is theory in the
 disasters of th
at war. On the 
"contrary, the de"
viations made fr
om his theory we
"re, in his opini"
"on,
the sole ca"
use of the whole
" disaster, and w"
ith characterist
ically gleeful 
sarcasm he would
" remark, “Ther"
"e, I said the wh"
ole affair would
 go to the devi
l!” Pfuel was 
one of those the
oreticians who s
o love their th
eory that they l
ose sight of the
 theory’s obje
ct—its practic
al application.
 His love of the
ory made him hat
e everything pra
"ctical, and
he "
would not listen
 to it. He was e
ven pleased by f
"ailures, for fai"
lures resulting
 from deviations
 in practice fro
m the theory onl
y proved to him 
 the accuracy of
 his theory.  
He said a few wo
rds to Prince An
drew and Cherný
shev about the p
"resent
war, wit"
h the air of a m
an who knows bef
orehand that all
" will go wrong,"
 and who is not 
displeased that 
it should be so.
 The unbrushed t
ufts of hair st
icking up behind
 and the hastily
 brushed hair on
 his temples ex
pressed this mos
t eloquently.  
 He passed into 
"the next room, a"
"nd the deep, que"
rulous sounds of
 his voice were
 at once heard f
rom there.   
   CHAPTER XI
  Prince Andre
w’s eyes were 
still following 
Pfuel out of the
 room when Coun
t Bennigsen ente
"red hurriedly, a"
nd nodding to Bo
"lkónski, but no"
"t
pausing, went"
" into the study,"
 giving instruct
ions to his adju
tant as he went
. The Emperor wa
"s following him,"
 and Bennigsen h
ad hastened on 
to make some pre
parations and to
 be ready to rec
eive the soverei
gn. Chernýshev
 and Prince Andr
ew went out into
" the porch, wher"
"e the Emperor,
"
who looked fatig
"ued, was dismoun"
ting. Marquis Pa
ulucci was talki
ng to him with 
particular warmt
h and the Empero
"r, with his head"
 bent to the le
"ft, was listenin"
g with a dissati
sfied air. The E
mperor moved for
ward evidently 
wishing to end t
"he conversation,"
 but the flushed
 and excited It
"alian, oblivious"
" of decorum, fol"
lowed him and co
ntinued to speak
.  “And as f
or the man who a
dvised forming t
his camp—the D
"rissa camp,” s"
"aid
Paulucci, a"
s the Emperor mo
unted the steps 
and noticing Pri
nce Andrew scan
ned his unfamili
"ar face, “as t"
"o that person, s"
ire...” contin
"ued
Paulucci, d"
"esperately, appa"
rently unable to
 restrain himsel
"f, “the man
w"
ho advised the D
rissa camp—I s
ee no alternativ
e but the lunati
c asylum or the
 gallows!”  
Without heeding 
the end of the I
talian’s remar
"ks, and as thoug"
h not hearing t
"hem, the Emperor"
", recognizing Bo"
"lkónski, addres"
sed him graciou
sly.  “I am 
very glad to see
 you! Go in ther
e where they are
" meeting, and wa"
it for me.” 
 The Emperor we
nt into the stud
y. He was follow
ed by Prince Pet
er Mikháylovic
h Volkónski and
" Baron Stein, an"
d the door close
d behind them. 
"Prince Andrew, t"
aking advantage 
of the Emperor�
"�s permission, a"
ccompanied Paul
"ucci, whom he ha"
d known in Turke
"y, into the draw"
ing room where t
he council was 
assembled.  Pr
ince Peter Mikh�
�ylovich Volkón
ski occupied the
" position, as it"
" were,
of chief"
 of the Emperor�
��s staff. He ca
me out of the st
udy into the dr
awing room with 
some maps which 
he spread on a t
"able, and put
q"
uestions on whic
h he wished to h
ear the opinion 
of the gentlemen
 present. What 
had happened was
 that news (whic
h afterwards pro
ved to be false
) had been recei
ved during the n
ight of a moveme
nt by the French
 to outflank th
e Drissa camp. 
 The first to s
peak was General
" Armfeldt who, t"
o meet the diffi
culty that pres
"ented itself, un"
expectedly propo
sed a perfectly 
new position aw
ay from the Pete
rsburg and Mosco
w roads. The rea
son for this was
 inexplicable (
unless he wished
 to show that he
", too, could hav"
"e an
opinion), "
but he urged tha
t at this point 
the army should 
unite and there
 await the enemy
. It was plain t
hat Armfeldt had
 thought out tha
t plan long ago
 and now expound
ed it not so muc
h to answer the 
questions put�
"�which, in fact,"
 his plan did no
t answer—as to
 avail himself o
f the opportuni
ty to air it. It
 was one of the 
millions of prop
"osals, one as
g"
"ood as another, "
that could be ma
de as long as it
 was quite unkno
wn what charact
er the war would
 take. Some disp
uted his argumen
"ts, others
defe"
nded them. Young
 Count Toll obje
cted to the Swed
ish general’s 
views more warm
ly than anyone e
"lse, and in the "
course of the di
spute drew from 
 his side pocket
 a well-filled n
"otebook, which h"
e asked permissi
on to read to t
hem. In these vo
luminous notes T
oll suggested an
"other scheme,
t"
otally different
 from Armfeldt�
�s or Pfuel’s 
plan of campaign
. In answer to 
"Toll, Paulucci s"
uggested an adva
nce and an attac
"k, which, he urg"
"ed,
could alone"
 extricate us fr
om the present u
ncertainty and f
rom the trap (a
s he called the 
Drissa camp) in 
which we were si
tuated.  Durin
g all these disc
ussions Pfuel an
d his interprete
"r, Wolzogen
(hi"
s “bridge” i
n court relation
"s), were silent."
 Pfuel only snor
ted contemptuou
sly and turned a
"way, to show tha"
t he would never
 demean himself
 by replying to 
such nonsense as
 he was now hear
ing. So when Pr
"ince Volkónski,"
 who was in the 
"chair, called on"
 him to give his
"
opinion, he me"
rely said:  �
�Why ask me? Gen
eral Armfeldt ha
s proposed a spl
endid position w
ith an exposed 
"rear, or why not"
 this Italian ge
ntleman’s atta
"ck—very fine, "
"or
a retreat, a"
lso good! Why as
k me?” said he
". “Why, you yo"
urselves know e
verything better
 than I do.” 
 But when Volk�
"�nski said, with"
" a frown, that i"
t was in the Emp
eror’s name t
hat he asked his
" opinion, Pfuel "
"rose and, sudden"
ly growing anima
"ted,
began to s"
peak:  “Ever
ything has been 
"spoiled, everyth"
"ing muddled, eve"
rybody thought t
hey knew better
" than I did, and"
 now you come to
 me! How mend ma
tters? There is
 nothing to mend
! The principles
 laid down by me
 must be strictl
"y
adhered to,�"
"� said he, drumm"
ing on the table
 with his bony f
ingers. “What 
 is the difficul
"ty? Nonsense, ch"
ildishness!” 
 He went up to 
the map and spea
king rapidly beg
an proving that 
no eventuality 
could alter the 
efficiency of th
"e Drissa camp, t"
hat everything 
had been foresee
"n, and that if t"
he enemy were re
ally going to o
"utflank it, the "
enemy would inev
itably be destro
yed.  Paulucci
", who did not kn"
"ow German, began"
 questioning him
 in French. Wol
zogen came to th
e assistance of 
"his chief, who s"
poke French badl
"y,
and began tr"
anslating for hi
"m, hardly able t"
o keep pace with
" Pfuel, who
was"
 rapidly demonst
rating that not 
only all that ha
"d happened, but "
all that could 
"happen, had been"
 foreseen in his
" scheme, and tha"
t if there were
 now any difficu
lties the whole 
fault lay in the
 fact that his p
lan had not bee
n precisely exec
uted. He kept la
ughing sarcastic
"ally, he
demons"
"trated, and at l"
ast contemptuous
ly ceased to dem
"onstrate, like
"
a mathematician 
who ceases to pr
ove in various w
ays the accuracy
 of a problem t
hat has already 
been proved. Wol
zogen took his p
lace and contin
ued to explain h
is views in Fren
"ch, every now an"
d then turning t
o Pfuel and say
"ing, “Is it no"
"t so, your excel"
lency?” But Pf
"uel, like a man"
 heated in a fig
ht who strikes t
hose on his own 
"side, shouted an"
grily at his ow
"n supporter, Wol"
zogen:  “Wel
"l, of course, wh"
at more is there
 to explain?” 
  Paulucci and 
Michaud both att
acked Wolzogen s
imultaneously in
 French. Armfel
dt addressed Pfu
el in German. To
ll explained to 
Volkónski in R
ussian. Prince A
ndrew listened a
nd observed in s
ilence.  Of al
l these men Prin
ce Andrew sympat
hized most with 
"Pfuel, angry,
d"
"etermined, and a"
bsurdly self-con
fident as he was
. Of all those p
"resent,
evident"
ly he alone was 
not seeking anyt
hing for himself
", nursed no
hat"
red against anyo
"ne, and only des"
ired that the pl
"an, formed on a"
 theory arrived 
at by years of t
"oil, should be c"
arried out. He w
"as
ridiculous, "
and unpleasantly
" sarcastic, but "
yet he inspired 
involuntary res
pect by his boun
dless devotion t
o an idea. Besid
"es this, the rem"
arks of all exc
ept Pfuel had on
e common trait t
hat had not been
 noticeable at 
the council of w
ar in 1805: ther
e was now a pani
c fear of Napole
"on’s
genius, "
"which, though co"
"ncealed, was not"
iceable in every
 rejoinder. Eve
rything was assu
med to be possib
"le for Napoleon,"
 they expected h
im from every s
"ide, and invoked"
 his terrible na
me to shatter ea
ch other’s pr
oposals. Pfuel a
lone seemed to c
onsider Napoleon
 a barbarian lik
e everyone else
 who opposed his
 theory. But bes
ides this feelin
"g of
respect, P"
fuel evoked pity
 in Prince Andre
w. From the tone
 in which the c
ourtiers address
ed him and the w
ay Paulucci had 
allowed himself 
to speak of him
" to the Emperor,"
 but above all f
rom a certain de
speration in Pf
uel’s own expr
"essions, it was "
clear that the o
"thers knew, and "
Pfuel himself f
"elt, that his fa"
ll was at hand. 
And despite his 
self-confidence 
 and grumpy Germ
an sarcasm he wa
"s pitiable, with"
 his hair smooth
ly brushed on t
he temples and s
ticking up in tu
fts behind. Thou
gh he concealed
 the fact under 
a show of irrita
tion and contemp
"t, he was
evide"
ntly in despair 
that the sole re
maining chance o
f verifying his 
 theory by a hug
e experiment and
 proving its sou
ndness to the wh
ole world was s
lipping away fro
m him.  The di
scussions contin
"ued a long time,"
 and the longer 
they lasted the
 more heated bec
ame the disputes
", culminating in"
 shouts and per
"sonalities, and "
the less was it 
possible to arri
ve at any genera
l conclusion fr
om all that had 
been said. Princ
"e Andrew, listen"
ing to this pol
yglot talk and t
o these surmises
", plans, refutat"
"ions, and shouts"
",
felt nothing "
but amazement at
 what they were 
saying. A though
t that had long
 since and often
 occurred to him
 during his mili
tary activities�
��the idea that
 there is not an
d cannot be any 
"science of war, "
and that theref
ore there can be
 no such thing a
s a military gen
ius—now appear
ed to him an ob
vious truth. “
What theory and 
science is possi
ble about a mat
ter the conditio
ns and circumsta
nces of which ar
e unknown and ca
nnot be defined
", especially whe"
n the strength o
f the acting for
ces cannot be a
scertained? No o
ne was or is abl
e to foresee in 
what condition o
ur or the enemy
’s armies will
 be in a day’s
" time, and no on"
e can gauge the 
 force of this o
r that detachmen
t. Sometimes—w
hen there is not
 a coward at th
e front to shout
", ‘We are cut "
off!’ and star
"t running, but a"
 brave and joll
y lad who shouts
", ‘Hurrah!’�"
��a detachment o
f five thousand 
 is worth thirty
" thousand, as at"
" Schön Grabern,"
 while at times 
fifty thousand 
run from eight t
"housand, as at A"
usterlitz. What 
science can the
re be in a matte
"r in which, as i"
n all practical 
"matters, nothing"
 can be defined
 and everything 
depends on innum
erable condition
"s, the
signific"
ance of which is
 determined at a
 particular mome
nt which arrives
 no one knows w
hen? Armfeldt sa
ys our army is c
"ut in half, and "
Paulucci says w
e have got the F
rench army betwe
en two fires; Mi
chaud says that 
 the worthlessne
ss of the Drissa
 camp lies in ha
ving the river b
"ehind it,
and P"
fuel says that i
s what constitut
es its strength;
 Toll proposes 
"one plan, Armfel"
"dt another, and "
they are all goo
"d and all bad, a"
nd the advantag
es of any sugges
tions can be see
n only at the mo
ment of trial. 
And why do they 
all speak of a �
��military geniu
s’? Is a man a
 genius who can
 order bread to 
be brought up at
 the right time 
and say who is t
o go to the rig
ht and who to th
e left? It is on
ly because milit
ary men are inv
ested with pomp 
and power and cr
owds of sychopha
nts flatter powe
"r,
attributing "
to it qualities 
of genius it doe
s not possess. T
he best general
s I have known w
"ere, on the cont"
"rary, stupid or "
absent-minded m
en. Bagratión w
"as the best, Nap"
oleon himself ad
mitted that. And
 of Bonaparte h
imself! I rememb
"er his limited, "
self-satisfied f
ace on the fiel
d of Austerlitz.
 Not only does a
 good army comma
nder not need an
y special quali
"ties, on the con"
trary he needs t
he absence of th
e highest and b
est human attrib
"utes—love, poe"
"try, tenderness,"
 and philosophic
 inquiring doub
t. He should be 
"limited, firmly "
convinced that w
hat he is doing
 is very importa
nt (otherwise he
 will not have s
ufficient patie
"nce), and only t"
hen will he be a
 brave leader. G
od forbid that h
e should be hum
"ane, should love"
", or pity, or th"
ink of what is j
ust and unjust.
 It is understan
dable that a the
ory of their ‘
genius’ was i
nvented for them
 long ago becaus
e they have powe
r! The success o
f a military ac
tion depends not
" on them, but on"
 the man in the 
ranks who shout
"s, ‘We are los"
t!’ or who sho
"uts, ‘Hurrah!�"
�� And only in t
he ranks can on
e serve with ass
urance of being 
useful.”  So
 thought Prince 
Andrew as he lis
tened to the tal
"king, and he rou"
sed himself onl
y when Paulucci 
called him and e
veryone was leav
ing.  At the r
eview next day t
he Emperor asked
 Prince Andrew w
here he would l
"ike to serve, an"
d Prince Andrew 
lost his standin
g in court circl
es forever by n
ot asking to rem
ain attached to 
the sovereign’
"s person, but
f"
or permission to
 serve in the ar
my.      C
HAPTER XII  Be
fore the beginni
ng of the campai
"gn, Rostóv had "
received a lette
r from his pare
nts in which the
y told him brief
ly of Natásha�
�s illness and t
he breaking off
 of her engageme
nt to Prince And
rew (which they 
explained by Na
tásha’s havin
g rejected him) 
and again asked 
Nicholas to reti
re from the arm
y and return hom
e. On receiving 
"this letter, Nic"
holas did not e
ven make any att
empt to get leav
e of absence or 
to retire from t
"he
army, but wr"
ote to his paren
ts that he was s
orry Natásha wa
s ill and her e
ngagement broken
" off, and that h"
e would do all h
e could to meet 
their wishes. T
o Sónya he wrot
e separately.  
 “Adored frien
d of my soul!”
 he wrote. “No
thing but honor 
could keep me f
rom returning to
 the country. Bu
"t now, at the co"
mmencement of th
"e
campaign, I s"
hould feel disho
"nored, not only "
in my comrades�
� eyes but in m
"y own, if I pref"
erred my own hap
piness to my lov
e and duty to th
e Fatherland. B
ut this shall be
 our last separa
tion. Believe me
", directly
the "
"war is over, if "
I am still alive
 and still loved
" by you, I will"
 throw up everyt
hing and fly to 
"you, to press yo"
u forever to my 
ardent breast.�
"��

It was, in"
" fact, only the "
commencement of 
the campaign tha
t prevented Ros
tóv from return
ing home as he h
ad promised and 
marrying Sónya.
 The autumn in 
Otrádnoe with t
"he hunting, and "
the winter with 
the Christmas h
olidays and Són
"ya’s love, had"
 opened out to h
im a vista of tr
anquil rural jo
ys and peace suc
h as he had neve
"r known before, "
and which now a
llured him. “A
" splendid wife, "
"children, a good"
" pack of hounds,"
 a dozen leashe
s of smart borzo
"is, agriculture,"
" neighbors, serv"
ice by election
...” thought h
e. But now the c
ampaign was begi
"nning, and he ha"
d to remain wit
h his regiment. 
And since it had
" to be so, Nicho"
"las Rostóv,
as"
 was natural to 
"him, felt conten"
ted with the lif
e he led in the 
 regiment and wa
s able to find p
leasure in that 
life.  On his 
return from his 
furlough Nichola
"s, having been j"
oyfully welcomed
 by his comrade
"s, was sent to o"
btain remounts a
nd brought back 
from the Ukrain
e excellent hors
es which pleased
 him and earned 
him commendation
 from his comma
nders. During hi
s absence he had
 been promoted c
"aptain,
and whe"
n the regiment w
as put on war fo
oting with an in
crease in numbe
"rs, he was again"
 allotted his ol
d squadron.  T
he campaign bega
"n, the regiment "
was moved into P
oland on double 
"pay,
new office"
"rs arrived, new "
"men and horses, "
and above all ev
erybody was inf
ected with the m
errily excited m
ood that goes wi
th the commencem
"ent
of a war, a"
"nd Rostóv, cons"
cious of his adv
antageous positi
on in the regim
"ent, devoted him"
self entirely to
 the pleasures a
nd interests of 
 military servic
"e, though he kne"
w that sooner or
 later he would 
have to relinqu
ish them.  The
 troops retired 
from Vílna for 
various complica
ted reasons of s
"tate,
political"
 and strategic. 
Each step of the
 retreat was acc
ompanied by a c
omplicated inter
play of interest
"s, arguments, an"
d passions at h
eadquarters. For
 the Pávlograd 
"hussars, however"
", the whole of t"
his retreat dur
ing the finest p
eriod of summer 
and with suffici
ent supplies wa
s a very simple 
and agreeable bu
siness.  It wa
s only at headqu
arters that ther
e was depression
", uneasiness, an"
d intriguing; i
n the body of th
e army they did 
not ask themselv
es where they w
ere going or why
. If they regret
ted having to re
"treat, it was on"
ly because they
 had to leave bi
llets they had g
rown accustomed 
"to, or some
pre"
tty young Polish
 lady. If the th
ought that thing
s looked bad cha
nced to enter a
"nyone’s head, "
he tried to be a
s cheerful as be
fits a good sol
dier and not to 
think of the gen
eral trend of af
"fairs, but only "
of the task nea
rest to hand. Fi
rst they camped 
gaily before Ví
"lna, making
acq"
uaintance with t
he Polish landow
"ners, preparing "
for reviews and 
being reviewed 
by the Emperor a
nd other high co
mmanders. Then c
ame an order to
 retreat to Sven
tsyáni and dest
roy any provisio
ns they could no
t carry away wi
th them. Sventsy
áni was remembe
red by the hussa
rs only as the 
"drunken camp, a "
name the whole a
rmy gave to thei
r encampment the
"re,
and because"
 many complaints
 were made again
"st the troops, w"
"ho, taking
adva"
ntage of the ord
er to collect pr
"ovisions, took a"
"lso horses,
car"
"riages, and carp"
ets from the Pol
ish proprietors.
 Rostóv remembe
red Sventsyáni
", because on the"
 first day of th
eir arrival at t
hat small town 
he changed his s
ergeant major an
d was unable to 
manage all the d
runken men of h
"is squadron who,"
" unknown to him,"
 had appropriate
d five barrels 
of old beer. Fro
m Sventsyáni th
ey retired farth
er and farther t
"o Drissa,
and t"
hence again beyo
"nd Drissa, drawi"
ng near to the f
rontier of Russi
a proper.  On
 the thirteenth 
of July the Páv
lograds took par
t in a serious a
ction for the f
irst time.  On
 the twelfth of 
"July, on the eve"
" of that action,"
 there was a hea
vy storm of rai
n and hail. In g
"eneral, the summ"
er of 1812 was r
emarkable for i
ts storms.  Th
e two Pávlograd
 squadrons were 
bivouacking on a
" field of rye, w"
hich was alread
y in ear but had
 been completely
 trodden down by
 cattle and hor
ses. The rain wa
s descending in 
"torrents, and Ro"
"stóv, with a yo"
ung officer nam
"ed Ilyín, his p"
"rotégé, was si"
tting in a hasti
ly constructed 
shelter. An offi
cer of their reg
"iment, with long"
 mustaches exten
ding onto his c
"heeks, who after"
 riding to the s
taff had been ov
ertaken by the 
"rain, entered Ro"
stóv’s shelte
r.  “I have 
come from the st
"aff, Count. Have"
 you heard of Ra
évski’s expl
oit?”  And t
he officer gave 
them details of 
the Saltánov ba
"ttle, which he h"
ad heard at the
 staff.  Rost�
"�v, smoking his "
pipe and turning
 his head about 
as the water tr
ickled down his 
"neck, listened i"
"nattentively, wi"
th an occasional
 glance at Ily�
"�n, who was pres"
sing close to hi
"m. This officer,"
 a lad of sixte
en who had recen
tly joined the r
"egiment, was now"
 in the same re
lation to Nichol
as that Nicholas
 had been to Den
ísov seven year
s before. Ilyí
n tried to imita
te Rostóv in ev
erything and ado
red him as a gi
rl might have do
ne.  Zdrzhinsk
"i, the officer w"
ith the long mus
"tache, spoke gra"
ndiloquently of 
 the Saltánov d
am being “a Ru
ssian Thermopyla
"e,” and of how"
 a deed worthy 
of antiquity had
 been performed 
by General Raév
ski. He recounte
d how Raévski 
had led his two 
sons onto the da
m under terrific
 fire and had c
harged with them
 beside him. Ros
tóv heard the s
tory and not onl
y said nothing 
to encourage Zdr
zhinski’s enth
"usiasm but, on t"
"he contrary,
lo"
oked like a man 
ashamed of what 
"he was hearing, "
though with no 
intention of con
tradicting it. S
ince the campaig
ns of Austerlitz
 and of 1807 Ro
stóv knew by ex
perience that me
n always lie whe
n describing mi
"litary exploits,"
 as he himself h
ad done when rec
ounting them; be
"sides
that, he "
had experience e
nough to know th
at nothing happe
ns in war at al
l as we can imag
ine or relate it
. And so he did 
not like Zdrzhin
"ski’s
tale, n"
or did he like Z
drzhinski himsel
"f who, with his "
mustaches exten
ding over his ch
"eeks, bent low o"
ver the face of 
"his hearer, as w"
"as
his habit, a"
nd crowded Rost�
�v in the narrow
 shanty. Rostóv
 looked at him 
in silence. “I
n the first plac
"e, there must ha"
ve been such a c
onfusion and cr
owding on the da
m that was being
 attacked that i
f Raévski did l
ead his sons th
"ere, it could ha"
ve had no effect
 except perhaps 
on some dozen m
en nearest to hi
"m,” thought he"
", “the rest co"
uld not have see
n how or with w
hom Raévski cam
e onto the dam. 
And even those w
ho did see it w
ould not have be
en much stimulat
"ed by it, for wh"
at had they to d
o with Raévski
’s tender pate
rnal feelings wh
en their own ski
ns were in dange
"r?
And besides,"
 the fate of the
 Fatherland did 
not depend on wh
ether they took
 the Saltánov d
"am or not, as we"
 are told was th
e case at Therm
opylae. So why s
hould he have ma
de such a sacrif
ice? And why exp
ose his own chi
ldren in the bat
tle? I would not
 have taken my b
rother Pétya t
"here, or even Il"
"yín, who’s a "
stranger to me b
"ut a nice lad, b"
ut would have t
ried to put them
 somewhere under
" cover,” Nicho"
las continued t
"o think, as he l"
istened to Zdrzh
inski. But he di
d not express hi
"s
thoughts, for"
 in such matters
", too, he had ga"
ined experience.
 He knew that t
his tale redound
ed to the glory 
of our arms and 
so one had to p
retend not to do
ubt it. And he a
cted accordingly
.  “I can’
t stand this any
" more,” said I"
"lyín, noticing "
that Rostóv did
 not relish Zdr
zhinski’s conv
ersation. “My 
stockings and sh
irt... and the 
water is running
 on my seat! I�
�ll go and look 
for shelter. The
 rain seems les
s heavy.”  I
lyín went out a
nd Zdrzhinski ro
de away.  Five
 minutes later I
"lyín, splashing"
 through the mud
", came running b"
ack to the shan
ty.  “Hurrah
"! Rostóv, come "
quick! I’ve fo
und it! About tw
o hundred yards 
away there’s 
a tavern where o
urs have already
 gathered. We ca
n at least get 
"dry there, and M"
ary Hendríkhovn
a’s there.” 
  Mary Hendrík
hovna was the wi
fe of the regime
"ntal doctor, a p"
retty young Ger
man woman he had
 married in Pola
"nd. The doctor, "
whether from lac
k of means or b
ecause he did no
t like to part f
rom his young wi
fe in the early
 days of their m
"arriage, took he"
r about with him
 wherever the h
ussar regiment w
ent and his jeal
ousy had become 
a standing joke 
among the hussa
r officers.  R
ostóv threw his
 cloak over his 
"shoulders, shout"
ed to Lavrúshka
 to follow with
" the things, and"
—now slipping 
"in the mud, now "
splashing right 
 through it—se
t off with Ilyí
n in the lesseni
ng rain and the 
darkness that w
as occasionally 
rent by distant 
lightning.  �
"�Rostóv, where "
are you?”  �
��Here. What lig
htning!” they 
called to one an
other.     
 CHAPTER XIII 
"
In the tavern,"
 before which st
ood the doctor�
"�s covered cart,"
 there were alr
eady some five o
fficers. Mary He
"ndríkhovna, a p"
lump little blon
"de
German, in a"
 dressing jacket
" and nightcap, w"
as sitting on a 
broad bench in 
the front corner
". Her husband, t"
"he doctor, lay a"
sleep behind her
. Rostóv and I
"lyín, on enteri"
"ng the room, wer"
e welcomed with 
merry shouts an
d laughter.  �
"��Dear me, how j"
olly we are!” 
said Rostóv lau
ghing.  “And
 why do you stan
d there gaping?�
��  “What sw
ells they are! W
"hy, the water st"
reams from them!
 Don’t make ou
r drawing room 
so wet.”  �
�Don’t mess Ma
ry Hendríkhovna
’s dress!” c
ried other voice
s.  Rostóv an
d Ilyín hastene
d to find a corn
er where they co
uld change into 
 dry clothes wit
hout offending M
ary Hendríkhovn
a’s modesty. T
hey were going 
into a tiny rece
ss behind a part
"ition to change,"
 but found it c
ompletely filled
 by three office
rs who sat playi
ng cards by the 
light of a soli
tary candle on a
"n empty box, and"
 these officers 
would on no acc
ount yield their
 position. Mary 
Hendríkhovna ob
liged them with 
the loan of a p
etticoat to be u
sed as a curtain
", and behind tha"
t screen Rostó
"v and Ilyín, he"
lped by Lavrúsh
ka who had broug
"ht their kits,
"
changed their we
t things for dry
 ones.  A fire
 was made up in 
the dilapidated 
brick stove. A b
"oard was found,"
 fixed on two sa
ddles and covere
d with a horsecl
"oth, a small sam"
ovar was produc
ed and a cellare
t and half a bot
"tle of rum, and "
having asked Mar
y Hendríkhovna
" to preside, the"
y all crowded ro
und her. One off
ered her a clea
n handkerchief t
o wipe her charm
"ing hands, anoth"
er spread a jack
et under her li
ttle feet to kee
p them from the 
"damp, another hu"
ng his coat ove
r the window to 
keep out the dra
"ft, and yet anot"
her waved the fl
ies off her hus
"band’s face, l"
est he should wa
ke up.  “Lea
"ve him alone,”"
 said Mary Hendr
"íkhovna, smilin"
g timidly and ha
ppily. “He is
 sleeping well a
"s it is, after a"
 sleepless night
".”

“Oh, n"
"o, Mary Hendrík"
"hovna,” replie"
"d the officer, �"
��one must look 
after the docto
r. Perhaps he’
ll take pity on 
"me someday, when"
 it comes to cu
tting off a leg 
or an arm for me
.”  There we
re only three tu
"mblers, the wate"
r was so muddy t
hat one could n
ot make out whet
her the tea was 
"strong or weak, "
and the samovar 
held only six t
umblers of water
", but this made "
it all the pleas
anter to take t
urns in order of
 seniority to re
ceive one’s tu
mbler from Mary 
 Hendríkhovna�
�s plump little 
hands with their
 short and not o
verclean nails.
 All the officer
s appeared to be
", and really wer"
"e, in love with"
 her that evenin
g. Even those pl
aying cards behi
nd the partition
 soon left thei
r game and came 
over to the samo
"var, yielding to"
 the general mo
od of courting M
ary Hendríkhovn
"a. She, seeing h"
erself surrounde
d by such brill
iant and polite 
"young men, beame"
d with satisfact
"ion, try as
she"
 might to hide i
"t, and perturbed"
 as she evidentl
y was each time 
her husband mov
ed in his sleep 
behind her.  T
here was only on
"e spoon, sugar w"
as more plentifu
l than anything 
"
else, but it to"
ok too long to d
"issolve, so it w"
as decided that 
Mary Hendríkho
vna should stir 
the sugar for ev
eryone in turn. 
Rostóv received
"
his tumbler, a"
nd adding some r
um to it asked M
ary Hendríkhovn
a to stir it. 
 “But you tak
e it without sug
"ar?” she said,"
 smiling all the
" time, as if
ev"
erything she sai
d and everything
 the others said
 was very amusin
g and had a dou
ble meaning.  
“It is not the
" sugar I want, b"
ut only that you
r little hand sh
ould stir my te
a.”  Mary He
ndríkhovna asse
nted and began l
ooking for the s
poon which someo
ne meanwhile ha
d pounced on.  
 “Use your fin
"ger, Mary Hendr�"
"�khovna, it will"
" be still nicer,"
” said Rostó
v.  “Too hot
!” she replied
", blushing with "
pleasure.  Ily
ín put a few dr
ops of rum into 
the bucket of wa
ter and brought 
it to Mary Hend
"ríkhovna, askin"
g her to stir it
 with her finger
.  “This is 
"my cup,” said "
he. “Only dip 
your finger in i
t and I’ll dri
nk it all up.�
�  When they h
ad emptied the s
"amovar, Rostóv "
took a pack of c
ards and propos
ed that they sho
uld play “King
s” with Mary H
endríkhovna. Th
ey drew lots to
 settle who shou
ld make up her s
et. At Rostóv�
�s suggestion it
 was agreed tha
t whoever became
 “King” shou
ld have the righ
t to kiss Mary 
Hendríkhovna’
"s hand, and that"
 the “Booby”
 should go to re
fill and reheat 
 the samovar for
 the doctor when
 the latter awok
"e.

“Well, b"
ut supposing Mar
y Hendríkhovna 
is ‘King’?�
� asked Ilyín. 
"

“As it is, "
"she is Queen, an"
d her word is la
w!”  They ha
d hardly begun t
o play before th
e doctor’s dis
heveled head su
ddenly appeared 
from behind Mary
 Hendríkhovna. 
He had been awak
e for some time
", listening to w"
hat was being sa
"id, and evidentl"
y found nothing 
 entertaining or
 amusing in what
 was going on. H
is face was sad 
and depressed. 
Without greeting
" the officers, h"
e scratched hims
elf and asked t
o be allowed to 
pass as they wer
e blocking the w
ay. As soon as h
e had left the 
room all the off
icers burst into
 loud laughter a
nd Mary Hendrí
khovna blushed t
ill her eyes fil
led with tears a
nd thereby becam
e still more at
tractive to them
. Returning from
" the yard, the d"
octor told his 
wife (who had ce
ased to smile so
" happily, and lo"
oked at him in 
"alarm, awaiting "
her sentence) th
at the rain had 
ceased and they 
must go to slee
p in their cover
"ed cart, or ever"
ything in it wou
ld be stolen.  
 “But I’ll s
end an orderly..
.. Two of them!�
�� said Rostóv.
 “What an idea
",
doctor!”
"
 “I’ll stand
 guard on it mys
elf!” said Ily
"ín.

“No, g"
"entlemen, you ha"
ve had your slee
"p, but I have no"
t slept for two 
"
nights,” repl"
"ied the doctor, "
and he sat down 
morosely beside 
"his wife,
waiti"
ng for the game 
to end.  Seein
g his gloomy fac
e as he frowned 
"at his wife, the"
 officers grew 
"still merrier, a"
nd some of them 
could not refrai
"n from laughter,"
 for which they
 hurriedly sough
t plausible pret
exts. When he ha
"d gone, taking
"
his wife with hi
"m, and had settl"
ed down with her
 in their covere
"d cart,
the off"
icers lay down i
"n the tavern, co"
vering themselve
s with their we
"t cloaks, but th"
ey did not sleep
 for a long time
; now they excha
"nged
remarks, r"
ecalling the doc
tor’s uneasine
ss and his wife�
"��s delight, now"
 they ran out i
nto the porch an
d reported what 
was taking place
 in the covered
 trap. Several t
"imes Rostóv, co"
"vering his head,"
 tried to go to
" sleep, but some"
 remark would ar
ouse him and con
versation would 
"be
resumed, to "
the accompanimen
t of unreasoning
", merry, childli"
ke laughter.  
    CHAPTER 
XIV  It was ne
arly three o’c
lock but no one 
"was yet asleep, "
when the quarte
rmaster appeared
 with an order t
o move on to the
 little town of
 Ostróvna. Stil
l laughing and t
"alking, the offi"
cers began hurri
edly getting re
ady and again bo
iled some muddy 
water in the sam
ovar. But Rost�
�v went off to h
is squadron with
out waiting for 
tea. Day was br
"eaking, the rain"
" had ceased, and"
 the clouds were
 dispersing. It 
felt damp and c
"old, especially "
in clothes that 
were still moist
. As they left 
the tavern in th
e twilight of th
"e dawn, Rostóv "
and Ilyín both 
glanced under t
he wet and glist
ening leather ho
od of the doctor
"’s cart, from"
 under the apron
 of which his fe
et were sticking
" out, and in the"
 middle of whic
h his wife’s n
ightcap was visi
ble and her slee
py breathing au
dible.  “She
 really is a dea
"r little thing,�"
�� said Rostóv 
"to Ilyín, who w"
as following hi
m.  “A charm
ing woman!” sa
"id Ilyín, with "
all the gravity 
of a boy of six
teen.  Half an
 hour later the 
squadron was lin
ed up on the roa
d. The command 
was heard to “
mount” and the
 soldiers crosse
d themselves and
 mounted. Rost�
�v riding in fro
nt gave the orde
r “Forward!”
 and the hussars
", with
clanking"
 sabers and subd
"ued talk, their "
horses’ hoofs 
splashing in the
"
mud, defiled i"
n fours and move
d along the broa
d road planted w
ith birch trees
" on each side, f"
ollowing the inf
antry and a batt
ery that had gon
e on in front. 
"

Tattered, blu"
"e-purple clouds,"
 reddening in th
"e east, were scu"
dding before th
e wind. It was g
rowing lighter a
nd lighter. That
 curly grass wh
ich always grows
 by country road
sides became cle
"arly visible, st"
ill wet with th
e night’s rain
; the drooping b
ranches of the b
"irches, also
we"
"t, swayed in the"
 wind and flung 
down bright drop
s of water to on
e side. The sol
diers’ faces w
ere more and mor
e clearly visibl
"e. Rostóv,
alw"
ays closely foll
"owed by Ilyín, "
rode along the s
ide of the road 
 between two row
s of birch trees
.  When campai
"gning, Rostóv a"
llowed himself t
he indulgence of
 riding not a r
egimental but a 
Cossack horse. A
 judge of horses
 and a sportsman
",
he had lately"
 procured himsel
"f a large, fine,"
" mettlesome, Don"
"éts horse,
dun"
"-colored, with l"
ight mane and ta
"il, and when he "
rode it no one c
ould outgallop 
him. To ride thi
s horse was a pl
"easure to him, a"
nd he thought o
"f the horse, of "
"the morning, of "
the doctor’s w
"ife, but not onc"
e of the impend
ing danger.  F
"ormerly, when go"
"ing into action,"
 Rostóv had fel
t afraid; now he
 had not the le
ast feeling of f
ear. He was fear
"less, not becaus"
e he had grown 
used to being un
der fire (one ca
nnot grow used t
"o danger), but b"
ecause he had l
earned how to ma
nage his thought
s when in danger
. He had grown 
accustomed when 
going into actio
n to think about
 anything but wh
at would seem m
ost likely to in
terest him—the
 impending dange
r. During the f
irst period of h
"is service, hard"
 as he tried and
 much as he repr
oached himself 
"with cowardice, "
he had not been 
"able to do this,"
 but with time 
it had come of i
tself. Now he ro
de beside Ilyín
 under the birch
" trees,
occasio"
nally plucking l
eaves from a bra
nch that met his
" hand, sometimes"
 touching his h
orse’s side wi
"th his foot, or,"
 without turning
" round,
handing"
 a pipe he had f
inished to an hu
ssar riding behi
"nd him, with as"
 calm and carele
ss an air as tho
ugh he were mere
ly out for a rid
e. He glanced w
ith pity at the 
excited face of 
"Ilyín, who talk"
ed much and in 
great agitation.
 He knew from ex
perience the tor
menting expectat
ion of terror a
nd death the cor
net was sufferin
g and knew that 
only time could 
 help him.  As
 soon as the sun
 appeared in a c
lear strip of sk
y beneath the cl
"ouds,
the wind "
"fell, as if it d"
ared not spoil t
he beauty of the
 summer morning 
 after the storm
; drops still co
"ntinued to fall,"
 but vertically 
"now, and
all wa"
s still. The who
le sun appeared 
on the horizon a
nd disappeared 
behind a long na
rrow cloud that 
hung above it. A
 few minutes lat
er it reappeare
d brighter still
 from behind the
 top of the clou
"d, tearing its
"
edge. Everything
 grew bright and
 glittered. And 
"with that light,"
 and as if in r
"eply to it, came"
 the sound of gu
ns ahead of them
.  Before Rost
óv had had time
 to consider and
 determine the d
istance of that
" firing, Count O"
stermann-Tolstó
y’s adjutant c
ame galloping fr
om Vítebsk wit
h orders to adva
nce at a trot al
ong the road.  
 The squadron ov
ertook and passe
d the infantry a
nd the battery�
�which had also
 quickened their
 pace—rode dow
"n a hill, and pa"
ssing through an
 empty and dese
rted village aga
in ascended. The
 horses began to
 lather and the 
 men to flush. 
 “Halt! Dress
 your ranks!” 
the order of the
 regimental comm
ander was heard
 ahead. “Forwa
rd by the left. 
"Walk, march!” "
came the order f
rom in front. 
 And the hussar
"s, passing along"
 the line of tro
ops on the left 
flank of our po
"sition, halted b"
ehind our Uhlans
 who were in the
 front line. To 
 the right stood
 our infantry in
 a dense column:
 they were the r
eserve. Higher 
"up the hill, on "
the very horizon
", our guns were "
visible through 
 the wonderfully
" clear air, brig"
htly illuminated
 by slanting mor
ning sunbeams. 
"In front, beyond"
" a hollow dale, "
could be seen th
e enemy’s col
umns and guns. O
ur advanced line
", already in act"
"ion, could be he"
ard briskly exc
hanging shots wi
th the enemy in 
the dale.  At 
"these sounds, lo"
"ng unheard, Rost"
óv’s spirits 
"rose, as at the "
strains of the 
merriest music. 
Trap-ta-ta-tap! 
cracked the shot
"s, now together,"
 now several qu
ickly one after 
another. Again a
ll was silent an
d then again it
 sounded as if s
omeone were walk
ing on detonator
s and exploding 
 them.  The hu
ssars remained i
n the same place
 for about an ho
ur. A cannonade 
 began. Count Os
termann with his
 suite rode up b
ehind the squadr
"on,
halted, spo"
ke to the comman
der of the regim
"ent, and rode up"
 the hill to th
e guns.  After
 Ostermann had g
"one, a command r"
ang out to the U
hlans.  “For
m column! Prepar
e to charge!” 
  The infantry 
in front of them
 parted into pla
toons to allow t
he cavalry to p
ass. The Uhlans 
"started, the str"
eamers on their 
spears flutterin
"g,
and trotted "
downhill toward 
the French caval
ry which was see
n below to the 
left.  As soon
 as the Uhlans d
escended the hil
"l, the hussars w"
ere ordered up 
the hill to supp
ort the battery.
 As they took th
e places vacated
" by the
Uhlans,"
 bullets came fr
"om the front, wh"
ining and whistl
"ing, but fell
s"
pent without tak
ing effect.  T
"he sounds, which"
 he had not hear
"d for so long, h"
ad an even more 
 pleasurable and
 exhilarating ef
fect on Rostóv 
than the previou
s sounds of fir
ing. Drawing him
"self up, he view"
ed the field of 
battle opening o
ut before him f
"rom the hill, an"
d with his whole
 soul followed t
he movement of 
the Uhlans. They
 swooped down cl
ose to the Frenc
"h dragoons, some"
thing confused 
happened there a
"mid the smoke, a"
nd five minutes 
later our Uhlan
s were galloping
" back, not to th"
e place they had
 occupied but mo
"re
to the left,"
 and among the o
range-colored Uh
lans on chestnut
 horses and beh
"ind them, in a l"
"arge group, blue"
 French dragoons
 on gray horses 
could be seen. 
      CHAPT
ER XV  Rostóv
", with his keen "
sportsman’s ey
"e, was one of th"
e first to catch
 sight of these
 blue French dra
goons pursuing o
ur Uhlans. Neare
r and nearer in
 disorderly crow
ds came the Uhla
ns and the Frenc
h dragoons purs
uing them. He co
uld already see 
"how these men, w"
ho looked so sma
ll at the foot 
"of the hill, jos"
tled and overtoo
"k one another, w"
aving their arm
s and their sabe
rs in the air. 
 Rostóv gazed 
at what was happ
ening before him
 as at a hunt. H
e felt instinct
ively that if th
e hussars struck
 at the French d
"ragoons now, the"
 latter could n
ot withstand the
"m, but if a char"
ge was to be mad
e it must be do
"ne now, at that "
"very moment, or "
it would be too 
late. He looked 
 around. A capta
"in, standing bes"
"ide him, was gaz"
ing like himself
 with eyes fixe
d on the cavalry
 below them.  
“Andrew Sevast
yánych!” said
 Rostóv. “You
" know, we could "
crush them....�
�  “A fine t
hing too!” rep
lied the captain
", “and really."
..”  Rostóv
", without waitin"
g to hear him ou
"t, touched his h"
"orse, galloped t"
o the front of 
"his squadron, an"
d before he had 
time to finish g
iving the word 
"of command, the "
"whole squadron, "
sharing his feel
"ing, was followi"
ng him. Rostóv
 himself did not
 know how or why
 he did it. He a
cted as he did 
"when hunting, wi"
thout reflecting
 or considering.
 He saw the drag
oons near and t
hat they were ga
lloping in disor
der; he knew the
y could not wit
hstand an attack
—knew there wa
s only that mome
nt and that if h
e let it slip i
t would not retu
rn. The bullets 
were whining and
 whistling so s
timulatingly aro
und him and his 
horse was so eag
er to go that he
 could not rest
rain himself. He
 touched his hor
"se, gave the wor"
"d of command,
a"
"nd immediately, "
hearing behind h
im the tramp of 
the horses of hi
s deployed squa
"dron, rode at fu"
ll trot downhill
 toward the drag
oons. Hardly ha
d they reached t
he bottom of the
 hill before the
ir pace instinc
tively changed t
"o a gallop, whic"
h grew faster an
d faster as they
 drew nearer to
 our Uhlans and 
the French drago
ons who galloped
 after them. Th
e dragoons were 
now close at han
d. On seeing the
" hussars, the
f"
oremost began to
" turn, while tho"
se behind began 
to halt. With th
e same feeling 
with which he ha
d galloped acros
s the path of a 
"wolf, Rostóv
g"
ave rein to his 
Donéts horse an
d galloped to in
tersect the path
 of the dragoon
s’ disordered 
lines. One Uhlan
" stopped, anothe"
r who was on foo
t flung himself
 to the ground t
o avoid being kn
"ocked over, and "
a riderless hor
se fell in among
 the hussars. Ne
arly all the Fre
nch dragoons wer
e galloping bac
"k. Rostóv, pick"
ing out one on a
" gray horse, das"
hed after him. 
On the way he ca
"me upon a bush, "
his gallant hors
"e cleared it, an"
d almost before
 he had righted 
himself in his s
addle he saw tha
t he would imme
diately overtake
 the enemy he ha
d selected. That
" Frenchman, by h"
is uniform an o
"fficer, was goin"
"g at a gallop, c"
rouching on his 
gray horse and 
urging it on wit
h his saber. In 
another moment R
ostóv’s horse
 dashed its bre
ast against the 
hindquarters of 
the officer’s 
"horse, almost
k"
"nocking it over,"
 and at the same
 instant Rostóv
", without knowin"
"g why,
raised h"
is saber and str
uck the Frenchma
n with it.  Th
e instant he had
" done this, all "
Rostóv’s anim
ation vanished. 
The officer fel
"l, not so much f"
rom the blow—w
hich had but sli
ghtly cut his a
rm above the elb
ow—as from the
 shock to his ho
rse and from fri
ght. Rostóv re
ined in his hors
"e, and his eyes "
sought his foe t
o see whom he h
ad vanquished. T
he French dragoo
n officer was ho
pping with one f
oot on the grou
"nd, the other be"
ing caught in th
e stirrup. His e
"yes, screwed
up"
 with fear as if
 he every moment
 expected anothe
"r blow, gazed up"
 at Rostóv wit
h shrinking terr
or. His pale and
 mud-stained fac
e—fair and yo
"ung, with a dimp"
le in the chin a
nd light-blue ey
es—was not an 
enemy’s face 
at all suited to
" a battlefield, "
but a most ordin
"ary, homelike fa"
ce. Before Rost
óv had decided 
what to do with 
"him, the officer"
" cried, “I
su"
rrender!” He h
urriedly but vai
nly tried to get
 his foot out of
 the stirrup an
d did not remove
 his frightened 
blue eyes from R
ostóv’s face.
 Some hussars w
ho galloped up d
isengaged his fo
ot and helped hi
m into the sadd
le. On all sides
", the hussars we"
re busy with the
 dragoons; one w
"as
wounded, but"
 though his face
" was bleeding, h"
e would not give
 up his horse; 
another was perc
hed up behind an
 hussar with his
 arms round him;
 a third was be
ing helped by an
 hussar to mount
 his horse. In f
"ront, the
Frenc"
h infantry were 
firing as they r
an. The hussars 
galloped hastily
 back with thei
r prisoners. Ros
tóv galloped ba
ck with the rest
", aware of
an u"
npleasant feelin
g of depression 
in his heart. So
mething vague an
"d
confused, whi"
ch he could not 
at all account f
"or, had come ove"
r him with the 
capture of that 
officer and the 
blow he had deal
t him.  Count 
Ostermann-Tolst�
�y met the retur
"ning hussars, se"
"nt for Rostóv,"
"
thanked him, an"
d said he would 
report his galla
nt deed to the E
mperor and woul
d recommend him 
for a St. George
’s Cross. When
 sent for by Cou
"nt
Ostermann, R"
"ostóv, remember"
ing that he had 
charged without 
"orders,
felt su"
re his commander
 was sending for
 him to punish h
im for breach of
 discipline. Os
termann’s flat
tering words and
 promise of a re
ward should the
refore have stru
ck him all the m
"ore pleasantly, "
but he still fel
t that same vag
uely disagreeabl
e feeling of mor
al nausea. “Bu
t what on earth
 is worrying me?
” he asked him
self as he rode 
back from the g
eneral. “Ilyí
"n? No, he’s sa"
fe. Have I disgr
aced myself in a
"ny way? No,
tha"
t’s not it.”
" Something else,"
 resembling remo
"rse, tormented h"
"im. “Yes,
oh "
"yes, that French"
 officer with th
e dimple. And I 
remember how my 
arm paused when
 I raised it.”
  Rostóv saw 
the prisoners be
ing led away and
 galloped after 
them to have a 
look at his Fren
chman with the d
imple on his chi
n. He was sittin
g in his foreig
n uniform on an 
hussar packhorse
 and looked anxi
ously about him
. The sword cut 
on his arm could
 scarcely be cal
led a wound. He 
 glanced at Rost
óv with a feign
ed smile and wav
ed his hand in g
reeting. Rostó
v still had the 
same indefinite 
"feeling, as of s"
hame.  All tha
t day and the ne
xt his friends a
nd comrades noti
ced that Rostóv
",
without being"
" dull or angry, "
"was silent, thou"
"ghtful, and preo"
ccupied. He dra
"nk reluctantly, "
tried to remain 
"alone, and kept "
turning somethin
g over in his m
ind.  Rostóv 
was always think
ing about that b
rilliant exploit
" of his, which t"
o his amazement
 had gained him 
the St. George�
�s Cross and eve
n given him a r
eputation for br
"avery, and there"
 was something h
e could not at a
ll understand. 
“So others are
 even more afrai
d than I am!” 
he thought. “S
o that’s all 
there is in what
 is called heroi
sm! And did I do
 it for my coun
try’s sake? An
d how was he to 
"blame, with his "
dimple and blue 
eyes? And how f
rightened he was
! He thought tha
t I should kill 
him. Why should 
 I kill him? My 
hand trembled. A
nd they have giv
en me a St. Geor
ge’s Cross...
. I can’t make
 it out at all.�
��  But while 
Nicholas was con
sidering these q
uestions and sti
ll could reach 
no clear solutio
n of what puzzle
"d him so, the wh"
eel of fortune i
"n the
service, "
as often happens
", turned in his "
favor. After the
 affair at Ostr
óvna he was bro
ught into notice
", received comma"

"
battalion, and "
when a brave off
icer was needed 
he was chosen. 
     CHAPTE
R XVI  On rece
iving news of Na
tásha’s illne
"ss, the countess"
", though not qui"
te well yet and
" still weak, wen"
t to Moscow with
 Pétya and the 
rest of the hou
"sehold, and the "
whole family mov
ed from Márya D
mítrievna’s h
ouse to their o
wn and settled d
own in town.  
Natásha’s ill
ness was so seri
"ous that, fortun"
ately for her an
d for her paren
"ts, the consider"
ation of all tha
t had caused the
" illness,
her c"
onduct and the b
reaking off of h
"er engagement, r"
eceded into the 
 background. She
 was so ill that
 it was impossib
le for them to c
onsider in how 
far she was to b
lame for what ha
d happened. She 
could not eat o
"r sleep, grew vi"
"sibly thinner, c"
"oughed, and, as "
the doctors made
" them
feel, was"
 in danger. They
 could not think
 of anything but
 how to help he
r. Doctors came 
to see her singl
y and in consult
"ation, talked mu"
"ch in
French, G"
"erman, and Latin"
", blamed one ano"
"ther, and prescr"
ibed a great va
riety of medicin
es for all the d
iseases known to
" them, but the s"
imple idea neve
r occurred to an
y of them that t
hey could not kn
ow the disease 
Natásha was suf
"fering from, as "
no disease suffe
red by a live ma
"n can be
known,"
 for every livin
g person has his
 own peculiariti
es and always h
as his own pecul
"iar, personal, n"
"ovel, complicate"
"d disease, unkno"
wn to medicine�
��not a disease 
"of the lungs, li"
"ver, skin, heart"
", nerves, and so"
 on mentioned i
"n medical books,"
 but a disease c
onsisting of one
 of the innumer
able combination
s of the maladie
s of those organ
s. This simple 
thought could no
t occur to the d
octors (as it ca
nnot occur to a 
wizard that he 
is unable to wor
k his charms) be
cause the busine
ss of their liv
"es was to cure, "
and they receive
d money for it a
nd had spent the
 best years of 
their lives on t
hat business. Bu
"t, above all, th"
at thought was 
kept out of thei
r minds by the f
act that they sa
w they were rea
"lly useful, as i"
n fact they were
 to the whole Ro
stóv family. Th
eir usefulness 
did not depend o
n making the pat
ient swallow sub
stances for the
 most part harmf
ul (the harm was
 scarcely percep
"tible, as they
"
were given in sm
"all doses), but "
they were useful
", necessary, and"
 indispensable 
because they sat
isfied a mental 
need of the inva
lid and of thos
e who loved her�
��and that is wh
"y there are, and"
" always will be,"
 pseudo-healers
", wise women, ho"
"meopaths, and al"
lopaths. They sa
tisfied that et
ernal human need
 for hope of rel
"ief, for sympath"
"y, and that
som"
ething should be
" done, which is "
felt by those wh
o are suffering.
 They satisfied
 the need seen i
n its most eleme
ntary form in a 
"child, when it
"
wants to have a 
place rubbed tha
t has been hurt.
 A child knocks 
itself and runs
 at once to the 
arms of its moth
er or nurse to h
ave the aching 
spot rubbed or k
"issed, and it fe"
els better when 
this is done. Th
e child cannot 
believe that the
 strongest and w
isest of its peo
ple have no rem
edy for its pain
", and the hope o"
f relief and the
 expression of i
ts mother’s s
ympathy while sh
e rubs the bump 
comforts it. The
 doctors were o
f use to Natásh
a because they k
issed and rubbed
" her bump, assur"
ing her that it
 would soon pass
 if only the coa
chman went to th
e chemist’s in
 the Arbát and
 got a powder an
d some pills in 
a pretty box for
 a ruble and se
"venty kopeks, an"
d if she took th
ose powders in b
oiled water at 
intervals of pre
cisely two hours
", neither more n"
or less.  What
 would Sónya an
d the count and 
countess have do
"ne, how would th"
"ey
have looked,"
 if nothing had 
"been done, if th"
ere had not been
 those pills to
 give by the clo
"ck, the warm dri"
"nks, the chicken"
" cutlets, and al"
l the other det
ails of life ord
ered by the doct
"ors, the carryin"
g out of which 
supplied an occu
pation and conso
lation to the fa
mily circle? How
 would the coun
t have borne his
 dearly loved da
ughter’s illne
ss had he not k
nown that it was
 costing him a t
"housand rubles, "
and that he woul
d not grudge th
ousands more to 
"benefit her, or "
had he not known
 that if her il
lness continued 
he would not gru
dge yet other th
ousands and woul
d take her abro
ad for consultat
"ions there, and "
had he not been 
able to explain 
 the details of 
how Métivier an
d Feller had not
 understood the 
"symptoms,
but F"
"rise had, and M�"
�drov had diagno
sed them even be
tter? What would
 the countess h
ave done had she
 not been able s
ometimes to scol
d the invalid f
or not strictly 
obeying the doct
or’s orders? 
 “You’ll ne
ver get well lik
"e that,” she w"
"ould say, forget"
ting her grief 
"in her vexation,"
 “if you won�
�t obey the doct
or and take your
 medicine at th
e right time! Yo
u mustn’t trif
"le with it, you "
"know, or it may "
turn to pneumon
"ia,” she would"
" go on, deriving"
 much comfort fr
om the utterance
 of that foreig
"n word, incompre"
hensible to othe
rs as well as to
 herself.  Wha
t would Sónya h
ave done without
 the glad consci
ousness that she
 had not undres
sed during the f
irst three night
"s, in order to b"
e ready to carr
y out all the do
ctor’s injunct
ions with precis
"ion, and that sh"
e still kept aw
ake at night so 
as not to miss t
he proper time w
hen the slightl
y harmful pills 
in the little gi
lt box had to be
 administered? 
Even to Natásha
 herself it was 
pleasant to see 
that so many sac
rifices were be
ing made for her
" sake, and to kn"
ow that she had 
to take medicine
 at certain hou
"rs, though she d"
eclared that no 
medicine would c
ure her and tha
t it was all non
sense. And it wa
s even pleasant 
to be able to s
"how, by disregar"
"ding the orders,"
 that she did no
t believe in med
ical treatment 
and did not valu
e her life.  T
he doctor came e
"very day, felt h"
"er pulse, looked"
" at her tongue, "
and regardless 
of her grief-str
icken face joked
 with her. But w
hen he had gone
 into another ro
"om, to which the"
 countess hurrie
dly followed him
", he
assumed a "
grave air and th
oughtfully shaki
ng his head said
 that though th
"ere was danger, "
he had hopes of 
the effect of th
is last medicine
 and one must w
"ait and see, tha"
t the malady was
" chiefly mental,"
 but... And the
" countess, tryin"
g to conceal the
 action from her
self and from hi
"m,
slipped a go"
ld coin into his
 hand and always
 returned to the
 patient with a
 more tranquil m
ind.  The symp
toms of Natásha
’s illness wer
e that she ate l
"ittle, slept
li"
"ttle, coughed, a"
nd was always lo
w-spirited. The 
doctors said tha
t she could not
 get on without 
medical treatmen
"t, so they kept "
her in the stif
ling atmosphere 
"of the town, and"
 the Rostóvs di
d not move to th
e country that 
summer of 1812. 
  In spite of t
he many pills sh
e swallowed and 
the drops and po
wders out of th
e little bottles
 and boxes of wh
ich Madame Schos
s who was fond o
f such things m
ade a large coll
"ection, and in s"
pite of being de
prived of the c
ountry life to w
hich she was acc
"ustomed, youth p"
revailed. Natás
ha’s grief be
gan to be overla
id by the impres
sions of daily l
"ife, it ceased
"
to press so pain
fully on her hea
"rt, it gradually"
 faded into the 
"past,
and she b"
egan to recover 
physically.   
    CHAPTER X
VII  Natásha 
was calmer but n
o happier. She n
ot merely avoide
d all external 
forms of pleasur
"e—balls, prome"
"nades, concerts,"
 and theaters—
but she never l
aughed without a
 sound of tears 
in her laughter.
 She could not 
sing. As soon as
 she began to la
"ugh, or tried to"
 sing by herself
", tears
choked "
her: tears of re
"morse, tears at "
the recollection
 of those pure 
times which coul
"d never return, "
tears of vexatio
n that she shoul
d so uselessly 
have ruined her 
young life which
 might have been
 so happy. Laug
hter and singing
 in particular s
eemed to her lik
"e a blasphemy,
"
in face of her s
orrow. Without a
ny need of self-
"restraint, no wi"
sh to coquet ev
er entered her h
ead. She said an
d felt at that t
ime that no man
 was more to her
 than Nastásya 
"Ivánovna, the b"
uffoon. Somethin
g stood sentine
l within her and
 forbade her eve
"ry joy. Besides,"
 she had lost al
l the old inter
ests of her care
free girlish lif
e that had been 
so full of hope
. The previous a
"utumn, the hunti"
"ng, “Uncle,”"
 and the Christm
as holidays spe
nt with Nicholas
 at Otrádnoe we
re what she reca
lled oftenest a
nd most painfull
y. What would sh
e not have given
 to bring back e
ven a single da
y of that time! 
But it was gone 
forever. Her pre
sentiment at th
e time had not d
eceived her—th
at that state of
 freedom and rea
diness for any 
enjoyment would 
not return again
. Yet it was nec
essary to live 
on.  It comfor
ted her to refle
ct that she was 
not better as sh
e had formerly 
"imagined, but wo"
"rse, much worse,"
 than anybody el
se in the world.
 But this was n
ot enough. She k
"new that, and as"
"ked herself, “"
What next?” B
ut there was not
hing to come. Th
ere was no joy i
"n life, yet life"
 was passing. N
atásha apparent
ly tried not to 
be a burden or a
 hindrance to a
"nyone, but wante"
d nothing for he
rself. She kept 
away from everyo
ne in the house
 and felt at eas
e only with her 
brother Pétya. 
She liked to be
 with him better
 than with the o
"thers, and when "
alone with him s
he sometimes la
ughed. She hardl
y ever left the 
house and of tho
se who came to 
see them was gla
d to see only on
"e person, Pierre"
. It would have 
been impossible
 to treat her wi
th more delicacy
", greater care, "
and at the same
 time more serio
usly than did Co
unt Bezúkhov. N
atásha unconsci
ously felt this
 delicacy and so
 found great ple
asure in his soc
iety. But she w
as not even grat
eful to him for 
it; nothing good
 on Pierre’s p
art seemed to h
er to be an effo
"rt, it seemed so"
 natural for him
 to be kind to 
everyone that th
ere was no merit
 in his kindness
. Sometimes Nat�
�sha noticed em
barrassment and 
awkwardness on h
is part in her p
"resence,
especi"
ally when he wan
ted to do someth
ing to please he
"r, or feared tha"
t something the
y spoke of would
 awaken memories
 distressing to 
her. She notice
d this and attri
buted it to his 
general kindness
" and shyness,
w"
hich she imagine
d must be the sa
me toward everyo
ne as it was to 
her. After thos
e involuntary wo
rds—that if he
 were free he wo
uld have asked 
on his knees for
 her hand and he
r love—uttered
 at a moment whe
n she was so st
"rongly agitated,"
 Pierre never sp
oke to Natásha 
of his feelings;
 and it seemed 
plain to her tha
"t those words, w"
hich had then so
" comforted
her,"
 were spoken as 
all sorts of mea
ningless words a
re spoken to com
fort a crying c
hild. It was not
 because Pierre 
was a married ma
"n, but because
"
Natásha felt ve
ry strongly with
 him that moral 
barrier the abse
nce of which sh
e had experience
d with Kurágin 
that it never en
tered her head 
that the relatio
ns between him a
nd herself could
 lead to love on
" her
part, stil"
"l less on his, o"
r even to the ki
"nd of tender, se"
"lf-conscious,
r"
omantic friendsh
ip between a man
 and a woman of 
which she had kn
own several ins
tances.  Befor
e the end of the
 fast of St. Pet
"er, Agraféna Iv"
"ánovna Belóva,"
 a country neig
hbor of the Rost
"óvs, came to Mo"
scow to pay her 
devotions at th
e shrines of the
 Moscow saints. 
She suggested th
at Natásha shou
ld fast and pre
pare for Holy Co
"mmunion, and Nat"
ásha gladly wel
comed the idea. 
 Despite the doc
tor’s orders t
hat she should n
ot go out early 
"in the
morning,"
 Natásha insist
ed on fasting an
d preparing for 
"the sacrament,
"
not as they gene
rally prepared f
or it in the Ros
tóv family by a
ttending three 
services in thei
"r own house, but"
 as Agraféna Iv
"ánovna did, by"
 going to church
 every day for a
 week and not on
ce missing Vespe
"rs,
Matins, or "
Mass.  The cou
ntess was please
d with Natásha�
��s zeal; after 
the poor results
 of the medical
" treatment, in t"
he depths of her
 heart she hoped
 that prayer mi
ght help her dau
ghter more than 
"medicines and, t"
hough not withou
t fear and conc
ealing it from t
"he doctor, she a"
greed to Natásh
a’s wish and 
entrusted her to
 Belóva. Agraf�
�na Ivánovna us
ed to come to wa
ke Natásha at 
three in the mor
"ning, but genera"
lly found her al
ready awake. She
 was afraid of 
being late for M
atins. Hastily w
"ashing, and meek"
ly putting on h
er shabbiest dre
ss and an old ma
"ntilla, Natásha"
", shivering in t"
"he fresh
air, w"
ent out into the
 deserted street
s lit by the cle
ar light of dawn
. By Agraféna 
Ivánovna’s ad
vice Natásha pr
epared herself n
ot in their own
" parish, but at "
"a church where, "
according to the
 devout Agrafén
"a
Ivánovna, th"
e priest was a m
an of very sever
e and lofty life
. There were ne
ver many people 
in the church; N
atásha always s
tood beside Bel�
�va in the cust
omary place befo
re an icon of th
e Blessed Virgin
", let into the
"
screen before th
e choir on the l
"eft side, and a "
"feeling, new to "
"her, of
humilit"
y before somethi
ng great and inc
"omprehensible, s"
eized her when 
at that unusual 
"morning hour, ga"
zing at the dark
 face of the Vir
gin illuminated
 by the candles 
burning before i
t and by the mor
ning light fall
ing from the win
"dow, she listene"
d to the words o
f the service wh
ich she tried t
o follow with un
derstanding. Whe
n she understood
 them her perso
nal feeling beca
me interwoven in
 the prayers wit
h shades of its 
 own. When she d
id not understan
"d, it was sweete"
r still to think
 that the wish 
to understand ev
erything is prid
"e, that it is im"
possible to und
"erstand all, tha"
t it is only nec
essary to believ
e and to commit 
"
oneself to God,"
 whom she felt g
uiding her soul 
at those moments
. She crossed h
"erself, bowed lo"
"w, and when she "
did not understa
"nd, in horror
a"
t her own vilene
"ss, simply asked"
 God to forgive 
"her everything,"
"
everything, to "
have mercy upon 
her. The prayers
 to which she su
rrendered herse
lf most of all w
ere those of rep
entance. On her 
way home at an 
early hour when 
she met no one b
ut bricklayers g
oing to work or 
men sweeping th
"e street, and ev"
erybody within t
he houses was st
"ill asleep,
Nat"
ásha experience
d a feeling new 
"to her, a sense "
of the possibili
ty of correctin
"g her faults, th"
e possibility of
" a new, clean li"
"fe, and of
happ"
iness.  During
 the whole week 
she spent in thi
"s way, that feel"
ing grew every 
day. And the hap
piness of taking
" communion, or �"
��communing” a
s Agraféna Iv�
"�novna, joyously"
 playing with th
"e word, called i"
"t, seemed to Nat"
ásha so great 
that she felt sh
e should never l
ive till that bl
essed Sunday.  
 But the happy d
"ay came, and on "
that memorable S
"unday, when, dre"
ssed in white m
"uslin, she retur"
ned home after c
"ommunion, for th"
e first time for
 many months sh
e felt calm and 
not oppressed by
 the thought of 
the life that l
ay before her. 
 The doctor who
 came to see her
 that day ordere
d her to continu
e the powders h
e had prescribed
 a fortnight pre
viously.  “S
he must certainl
y go on taking t
hem morning and 
"evening,” said"
"
he, evidently "
sincerely satisf
ied with his suc
"cess. “Only, p"
lease be partic

 “Be quite ea

"ued playfully, a"

��She will soon 
be singing and f
rolicking about.
 The last medic
ine has done her
 a very great de
al of good. She 
has freshened u
p very much.”

The countess,"
 with a cheerful
 expression on h

down at her nai

APTER XVIII  A
t the beginning 
of July more and
 more disquietin
g reports about 
the war began t
o spread in Mosc
ow; people spoke
 of an appeal by
 the Emperor to 
"
the people, and"
 of his coming h
imself from the 
army to Moscow. 
And as up to th
e eleventh of Ju
ly no manifesto 
or appeal had be
"en received,
ex"
aggerated report
s became current
 about them and 
about the positi
on of Russia. I
t was said that 
the Emperor was 
leaving the army
 because it was 
"
in danger, it w"
as said that Smo
lénsk had surre
"ndered, that Nap"
oleon had an ar
my of a million 
and only a mirac
le could save Ru
ssia.  On the 
eleventh of July
", which was Satu"
"rday, the manife"
sto was received
 but was not ye
"t in print, and "
"Pierre, who was "
at the Rostóvs�
"��, promised
to"
 come to dinner 
"next day, Sunday"
", and bring a co"
py of the manife
"sto
and appeal,"
 which he would 
obtain from Coun
t Rostopchín. 
"
That Sunday, t"
he Rostóvs went
 to Mass at the 
Razumóvskis’ 
private chapel 
as usual. It was
 a hot July day.
 Even at ten o�
"�clock, when the"
 Rostóvs got o
ut of their carr
iage at the chap
"el, the sultry a"
"ir, the shouts o"
"f
hawkers, the "
light and gay su
mmer clothes of 
"the crowd, the d"
usty leaves of 
the trees on the
" boulevard, the "
sounds of the ba
nd and the white
 trousers of a 
battalion marchi
"ng to parade, th"
e rattling of wh
eels on the cob
"blestones, and t"
"he brilliant, ho"
t sunshine were 
all full of that
 summer languor
", that content a"
nd discontent wi
"th the present, "
which is most s
trongly felt on 
"a bright, hot da"
y in town. All t
he Moscow notab
"ilities, all the"
 Rostóvs’ acq
"uaintances, were"
 at the Razumóv
"skis’
chapel,"
" for, as if expe"
cting something 
"to happen, many "
wealthy families
 who usually le
ft town for thei
r country estate
s had not gone a
way that summer
". As Natásha, a"
t her mother’s
" side, passed th"
rough the crowd 
 behind a liveri
ed footman who c
leared the way f
"or them, she hea"
rd a young man 
speaking about h
er in too loud a
 whisper.  “
That’s Rostóv
"a, the one who.."
.”  “She�
"�s much thinner,"
 but all the sam
e she’s pretty
!”  She hear
"d, or thought sh"
"e heard, the nam"
es of Kurágin a
nd Bolkónski. B
ut she was alwa
ys imagining tha
t. It always see
med to her that 
everyone who lo
oked at her was 
thinking only of
 what had happen
ed to her. With 
a sinking heart
", wretched as sh"
e always was now
 when she found 
herself in a cr
"owd, Natásha in"
 her lilac silk 
dress trimmed wi
th black lace w
alked—as women
 can walk—with
 the more repose
 and stateliness
 the greater th
e pain and shame
 in her soul. Sh
e knew for certa
in that she was
" pretty, but thi"
s no longer gave
 her satisfactio
n as it used to.
 On the contrar
y it tormented h
er more than any
thing else of la
"te, and
particu"
larly so on this
" bright, hot sum"
mer day in town.
 “It’s Sunda
y again—anoth
"er week past,”"
" she thought, re"
calling that she
 had been here 
the Sunday befor
"e, “and always"
 the same life t
"hat is no life, "
and the same su
rroundings in wh
ich it used to b
e so easy to liv
"e. I’m pretty,"
"
I’m young, a"
nd I know that n
ow I am good. I 
"used to be bad, "
but now I know 
"I am good,” sh"
"e thought, “bu"
t yet my best ye
ars are slipping
 by and are no 
good to anyone.�
�� She stood by 
her mother’s s
ide and exchange
d nods with acq
uaintances near 
her. From habit 
she scrutinized 
the ladies’ d
"resses, condemne"
d the bearing of
 a lady standing
 close by who wa
s not crossing 
herself properly
 but in a crampe
"d manner, and ag"
ain she thought 
 with vexation t
hat she was hers
elf being judged
 and was judging
" others,
and su"
"ddenly, at the s"
ound of the serv
"ice, she felt ho"
rrified at her o
"wn
vileness, ho"
rrified that the
 former purity o
f her soul was a
gain lost to he
"r.

A comely, "
fresh-looking ol
d man was conduc
ting the service
 with that mild
 solemnity which
 has so elevatin
g and soothing a
n effect on the 
 souls of the wo
rshipers. The ga
tes of the sanct
uary screen were
" closed,
the cu"
rtain was slowly
" drawn, and from"
 behind it a sof
t mysterious voi
ce pronounced s
ome words. Tears
", the cause of w"
hich she herself
 did not unders
"tand, made Natá"
sha’s breast h
"eave, and a joyo"
us but oppressiv
e feeling agita
ted her.  “T
each me what I s
"hould do, how to"
" live my life, h"
ow I may grow go
"od
forever, for"
ever!” she ple
aded.  The dea
con came out ont
o the raised spa
ce before the al
"tar screen and,"
 holding his thu
"mb extended, dre"
w his long hair 
from under his d
"almatic
and, ma"
king the sign of
 the cross on hi
"s breast, began "
in a loud and s
olemn voice to r
ecite the words 
of the prayer...
.  “In peace
 let us pray unt
o the Lord.” 
 “As one comm
"unity, without d"
istinction of cl
"ass, without enm"
"ity, united
by "
brotherly love�
�let us pray!”
 thought Natásh
a.  “For the
 peace that is f
"rom above, and f"
or the salvation
 of our souls.�
�  “For the 
world of angels 
and all the spir
its who dwell ab
"ove us,” praye"
d Natásha.  
When they prayed
 for the warrior
"s, she thought o"
f her brother an
d Denísov. Whe
n they prayed fo
r all traveling 
"by land and sea,"
 she remembered
" Prince Andrew, "
"prayed for him, "
and asked God to
 forgive her al
l the wrongs she
 had done him. W
hen they prayed 
for those who lo
"ve us,
she pray"
ed for the membe
rs of her own fa
"mily, her father"
 and mother and 
"
Sónya, realizi"
ng for the first
 time how wrongl
y she had acted 
"toward
them, an"
d feeling all th
e strength of he
r love for them.
 When they pray
ed for those who
" hate us, she tr"
ied to think of 
her enemies and 
 people who hate
"d her, in order "
to pray for them
. She included a
mong her enemie
s the creditors 
and all who had 
business dealing
s with her fath
"er, and always a"
t the thought of
 enemies and tho
se who hated her
 she remembered
 Anatole who had
 done her so muc
h harm—and tho
ugh he did not 
hate her she gla
dly prayed for h
im as for an ene
my. Only at pray
er did she feel
 able to think c
learly and calml
y of Prince Andr
"ew and Anatole,"
 as men for whom
 her feelings we
re as nothing co
mpared with her 
awe and devotio
n to God. When t
hey prayed for t
he Imperial fami
ly and the Synod
",
she bowed ver"
y low and made t
he sign of the c
"ross, saying to "
herself that ev
en if she did no
"t understand, st"
ill she could no
"t doubt, and at"
 any rate loved 
the governing Sy
nod and prayed f
or it.  When h
e had finished t
he Litany the de
acon crossed the
 stole over his 
 breast and said
", “Let us comm"
it ourselves and
 our whole lives
 to Christ the 
Lord!”  “C
ommit ourselves 
"to God,” Natá"
sha inwardly rep
eated. “Lord G
"od, I
submit my"
self to Thy will
!” she thought
. “I want noth
"ing, wish for
n"
othing; teach me
 what to do and 
how to use my wi
"ll! Take me, tak"
e me!” prayed
" Natásha, with "
impatient emotio
"n in her heart, "
not crossing he
rself but lettin
g her slender ar
ms hang down as 
if expecting som
e invisible pow
er at any moment
 to take her and
 deliver her fro
"m herself,
from"
" her regrets, de"
"sires, remorse, "
"hopes, and sins."
  The countess
 looked round se
veral times at h
er daughter’s 
softened face a
nd shining eyes 
and prayed God t
o help her.  U
"nexpectedly, in "
the middle of th
"e service, and n"
ot in the usual 
order Natásha 
"knew so well, th"
e deacon brought
 out a small sto
"ol, the one he
"
knelt on when pr
aying on Trinity
" Sunday, and pla"
ced it before th
e doors of the 
sanctuary screen
. The priest cam
e out with his p
urple velvet bi
retta on his hea
"d, adjusted his "
"hair, and knelt "
down with an eff
ort. Everybody 
followed his exa
mple and they lo
oked at one anot
her in surprise
. Then came the 
prayer just rece
ived from the Sy
nod—a prayer f
or the delivera
nce of Russia fr
om hostile invas
ion.  “Lord 
"God of might, Go"
d of our salvati
on!” began the
 priest in that 
"
voice, clear, n"
ot grandiloquent
" but mild, in wh"
ich only the Sla
v clergy read a
nd which acts so
 irresistibly on
 a Russian heart
.  “Lord God
" of might, God o"
f our salvation!
 Look this day i

  In Natásha�
��s receptive co
ndition of soul 
this prayer affe
cted her strong
ly. She listened
 to every word a
bout the victory
 of Moses over 
"Amalek, of Gideo"
"n over Midian, a"
nd of David over
" Goliath, and ab"
out the destruc
tion of “Thy J

 she prayed to G

derness and emot
ion with which h

"rflowing, but wi"
thout fully und
erstanding what 
she was asking o
f God in that pr
ayer. She share

eart in the pray

t of righteousne
"ss,
for the str"
engthening of th

" and hope, and i"
ts animation by

ould not pray th
at her enemies m

she had more of
 them that she m
ight pray for th

could she doubt 
the righteousne
ss of the prayer
 that was being 
read on bended k

in her heart a d
evout and tremul
ous awe at the t
hought of the p
unishment that o
vertakes men for
" their sins, and"
 especially of h

sins, an"
d she prayed to 
God to forgive t

her that God he

      CHAPT
ER XIX  From t
he day when Pier
"re, after leavin"
g the Rostóvs�
� with Natásha�
��s grateful lo
ok fresh in his 
"mind, had gazed "
at the comet tha
t seemed to be 
fixed in the sky
 and felt that s
omething new was
 appearing on hi
s own horizon�
�from that day t
he problem of th
e vanity and use
lessness of all 
"
earthly things,"
 that had incess
antly tormented 
"him, no longer p"
resented itself
. That terrible 
question “Why?
” “Wherefore
?” which had c
ome to him amid
 every occupatio
"n, was now repla"
"ced, not by anot"
her question or 
by a reply to t
he former questi
"on, but by her i"
mage. When he li
"stened to, or
h"
imself took part
" in, trivial con"
"versations, when"
 he read or hear
d of human base
"ness or folly, h"
e was not horrif
"ied as formerly,"
 and did not as
k himself why me
n struggled so a
bout these thing
s when all is so
 transient and 
incomprehensible
—but he rememb
ered her as he h
ad last seen he
"r, and all his d"
oubts vanished�
�not because she
 had answered t

 And his soul fe

es the hours he

 he had to spend
" somehow, and th"

 from the seat o

 the former feel

elt that the con

"inue long, that "
a catastrophe wa

ould change his 
"
whole life, and"
 he impatiently

ears that the s

re the beast for
etold in the Ap
ocalypse. Moreov
"er, by applying "
the same system 
to the words qu
"arante-deux, * w"
hich was the ter
m allowed to the
 beast that “s
poke great thin
gs and blasphemi
"es,” the same "
number 666 was o
btained; from w
hich it followed
 that the limit 
fixed for Napole
on’s power had
 come in the ye
ar 1812 when the
 French emperor 
was forty-two. T
his prophecy pl
eased Pierre ver
y much and he of
ten asked himsel
f what would put
 an end to the 
power of the bea
"st, that is, of "
"Napoleon, and tr"
ied by the same
 system of using
 letters as numb
ers and adding t
"hem up, to find "
an answer to th
e question that 
engrossed him. H
e wrote the word
s L’Empereur 
"Alexandre, La na"
tion russe and a
dded up their nu
"mbers, but the s"
ums were either
 more or less th
an 666. Once whe
n making such ca
lculations he w
rote down his ow
n name in French
", Comte Pierre B"
"esouhoff, but th"
e sum of the nu
mbers did not co
me right. Then h
e changed the sp
"elling,
substit"
uting a z for th
e s and adding d
e and the articl
"e le, still
wit"
hout obtaining t
he desired resul
t. Then it occur
red to him: if t
he answer to th
e question were 
contained in his
" name, his natio"
nality would al
so be given in t
he answer. So he
 wrote Le russe 
Besuhof and addi
ng up the numbe
rs got 671. This
 was only five t
"oo much, and fiv"
e was represent
"ed by e, the ver"
y letter elided 
from the article
 le before the 
word Empereur. B
y omitting the e
", though incorre"
"ctly, Pierre got"
 the answer he 
sought. L’russ
e Besuhof made 6
66. This discove
ry excited him. 
"
How, or by what"
" means, he was c"
onnected with th
e great event fo
retold in the A
pocalypse he did
" not know, but h"
e did not doubt 
that connection 
for a moment. H
is love for Nat�

 Besuhof—all t

t of that spellb
"ound, petty sphe"
re of Moscow ha
bits in which he
 felt himself he
ld captive and l
ead him to a gr
eat achievement 
and great happin
ess.      * Fo
rty-two.   On
 the eve of the 
Sunday when the 
special prayer w
"as read, Pierre "
had promised th
e Rostóvs to br
"ing them, from C"
ount Rostopchín
 whom he knew w
"ell, both the ap"
peal to the peop
le and the news 
from the army. I
"n the
morning, "
when he went to 
call at Rostopch
ín’s he met t
here a courier 
fresh from the a
"rmy, an acquaint"
"ance of his own,"
 who often dance
d at Moscow bal

“Do, pl"
"ease, for heaven"
"’s sake, relie"
ve me of somethi
ng!” said the 
 courier. “I h
ave a sackful of
 letters to pare
nts.”  Among
 these letters w
as one from Nich
olas Rostóv to 
his father. Pier
re took that le
"tter, and Rostop"
chín also gave 
him the Emperor�
��s appeal to M
"oscow, which had"
 just been print
"ed, the last arm"
"y orders, and hi"
s own most rece

"�nski, appointed"
 to the command 
of a regiment of
 Chasseurs. Tho
ugh he did not w
ant to remind th
e Rostóvs of Bo

Pierr"
e could not refr

them happy by th
e news of their 
 son’s having 
received a decor

 somehow felt as

e step. But the 
chief reason fo
r not carrying o
ut his intention
 to enter the ar
my lay in the v
ague idea that h
e was L’russe 
Besuhof who had 
the number of th
"e beast,
666; t"
hat his part in 
the great affair
 of setting a li
mit to the powe
r of the beast t
hat spoke great 
and blasphemous 
things had been 
 predestined fro

that therefore h

 what was bound 
to come to pass.
      CHAP
TER XX  A few 
intimate friends
 were dining wit
h the Rostóvs t
"hat day, as usua"
l on Sundays. 
 Pierre came ea
rly so as to fin
d them alone.  
 He had grown so
 stout this year
 that he would h
ave been abnorma
l had he not be
"en so tall, so b"
"road of limb, an"
d so strong that
 he carried his 
 bulk with evide
nt ease.  He w
ent up the stair
"s, puffing and m"
uttering somethi
ng. His coachman
 did not even a
sk whether he wa
s to wait. He kn
ew that when his
 master was at 
the Rostóvs’ 
he stayed till m
idnight. The Ros
tóvs’ footman
 rushed eagerly
 forward to help
 him off with hi
s cloak and take
 his hat and st
"ick. Pierre, fro"
"m club habit, al"
ways left both h
at and stick in 
the anteroom. 
 The first pers
on he saw in the
 house was Natá
sha. Even before
" he saw
her, wh"
ile taking off h
"is cloak, he hea"
rd her. She was 
practicing solfa
 exercises in t
he music room. H
e knew that she 
had not sung sin
"ce her
illness,"
 and so the soun
d of her voice s
urprised and del
ighted him. He 
opened the door 
softly and saw h
"er, in the lilac"
 dress she had w
"orn at
church, "
walking about th
e room singing. 
She had her back
 to him when he 
 opened the door
", but when, turn"
"ing quickly, she"
" saw his broad, "
"surprised
face,"
 she blushed and
 came rapidly up
 to him.  “I
 want to try to 
"sing again,” s"
"he said, adding "
as if by way of 
"excuse,
“it i"
"s, at least, som"
ething to do.”
  “That’s 
capital!”  �
��How glad I am 
you’ve come! I
 am so happy tod
"ay,” she said,"
 with the old a
nimation Pierre 
had not seen in 
her for a long t
ime. “You know
 Nicholas has r
eceived a St. Ge
orge’s Cross? 
I am so proud of
 him.”  “O
"h yes, I sent th"
at announcement.
 But I don’t w
ant to interrupt
" you,”
he add"
"ed, and was abou"
t to go to the d
rawing room.  
Natásha stopped
 him.  “Coun
"t, is it wrong o"
f me to sing?”
 she said blushi
"ng, and fixing h"
er eyes inquiri
ngly on him.  
“No... Why sho
uld it be? On th
e contrary... Bu
t why do you ask
 me?”  “I 
don’t know mys
"elf,” Natásha"
 answered quickl
"y, “but I shou"
ld not like to 
do anything you 
disapproved of. 
I believe in you
 completely. You
 don’t know h
ow important you
" are to me, how "
much you’ve do
ne for me....”
 She spoke rapi
dly and did not 
notice how Pierr
e flushed at her
 words. “I sa
w in that same a
rmy order that h
"e, Bolkónski”"
 (she whispered 
the name hastil
"y), “is in Rus"
"sia, and in the "
army again. What
 do you think?�
�—she was spe
"aking hurriedly,"
 evidently afrai
d her strength m
ight fail her�
�“Will he ever
 forgive me? Wil
l he not always 
have a bitter fe
eling toward me
? What do you th
ink? What do you
 think?”  �
�I think...” P
"ierre replied, �"
��that he has no
thing to forgive
.... If I were 
in his place...�
��  By associa
"tion of ideas, P"
ierre was at onc
e carried back t
"o the day
when,"
 trying to comfo
"rt her, he had s"
aid that if he w
ere not himself 
but the best ma
n in the world a
"nd free, he woul"
d ask on his kne
es for her hand
; and the same f
"eeling of pity, "
"tenderness, and "
love took posses
sion of him and
 the same words 
rose to his lips
. But she did no
t give him time
 to say them.  
"
“Yes, you... "
you...” she sa
"id, uttering the"
 word you raptur
ously—“that�
��s a different
 thing. I know n
"o one kinder, mo"
"re generous, or "
better than you
; nobody could b
e! Had you not b
"een there then, "
"and now too, I d"
on’t know wha
t would have bec
"ome of me, becau"
se...”  Tear
s suddenly rose 
"in her eyes, she"
" turned away, li"
fted her music 
"before her eyes,"
 began singing a
"gain, and again "
began walking up
 and down the r
oom.  Just the
n Pétya came ru
nning in from th
e drawing room. 
  Pétya was no
w a handsome ros
y lad of fifteen
 with full red l
ips and resembl
ed Natásha. He 
was preparing to
 enter the unive
"rsity, but he an"
d his friend Ob
olénski had lat
"ely, in secret, "
agreed to join t
he hussars.  P
étya had come r
ushing out to ta
lk to his namesa
ke about this af
fair. He had as
ked Pierre to fi
nd out whether h
e would be accep
ted in the huss
ars.  Pierre w
alked up and dow
n the drawing ro
"om, not listenin"
g to what Pétya
 was saying.  
 Pétya pulled h
im by the arm to
 attract his att
ention.  “We
"ll, what about m"
y plan? Peter Ki
"rílych, for hea"
ven’s sake! Yo
u are my only h
"ope,” said Pé"
tya.  “Oh ye
"s, your plan. To"
 join the hussar
s? I’ll mentio
"n it, I’ll bri"
ng it all up to
day.”  “We
"ll, mon cher, ha"
ve you got the m
anifesto?” ask
ed the old count
. “The counte
ss has been to M
ass at the Razum
óvskis’ and h
eard the new pra
yer. She says i
t’s very fine.
"”

“Yes, I"
"’ve got it,”"
 said Pierre. �
�The Emperor is 
to be here tomor
row... there’
s to be an Extra
ordinary Meeting
 of the nobility
", and they are
"
talking of a lev
y of ten men per
 thousand. Oh ye
"s, let me congra"
tulate you!” 
"

“Yes, yes, "
"thank God! Well,"
 and what news f
rom the army?”
  “We are ag
ain retreating. 
They say we’re
 already near Sm
"olénsk,” repl"
ied Pierre.  
"“O Lord, O Lor"
d!” exclaimed 
the count. “Wh
ere is the manif
esto?”  “T
he Emperor’s a
ppeal? Oh yes!�
�  Pierre bega
n feeling in his
 pockets for the
" papers, but cou"
ld not find the
m. Still slappin
"g his pockets, h"
e kissed the han
d of the countes
s who entered t
he room and glan
ced uneasily aro
"und, evidently e"
xpecting Natás
"ha, who had left"
 off singing but
 had not yet com
e into the drawi
ng room.  “
"On my word, I do"
n’t know what 
I’ve done with
" it,” he said."
  “There he 
"is, always losin"
g everything!”
 remarked the co
untess.  Natá
sha entered with
 a softened and 
agitated express
ion of face and 
 sat down lookin
g silently at Pi
erre. As soon as
" she entered, Pi"
erre’s featur
"es, which had be"
"en gloomy, sudde"
"nly lighted up, "
and while still 
 searching for t
he papers he gla
nced at her seve
ral times.  �
"�No, really! I�"
"�ll drive home, "
I must have left
 them there. I�
�ll certainly..
.”  “But y
ou’ll be late 
for dinner.” 
 “Oh! And my 
coachman has gon
e.”  But Só
"nya, who had gon"
e to look for th
e papers in the 
"anteroom, had
f"
ound them in Pie
"rre’s hat, whe"
re he had carefu
lly tucked them 
under the linin
g. Pierre was ab
out to begin rea
"ding.

“No, "
"after dinner,”"
 said the old co
"unt, evidently e"
xpecting much e
njoyment from th
at reading.  A
"t dinner, at whi"
ch champagne was
 drunk to the he
alth of the new 
 chevalier of St
". George, Shinsh"
ín told them th
"e town news, of "
the illness of 
the old Georgian
" princess, of M�"
�tivier’s disa
ppearance from 
"Moscow, and of h"
ow some German f
ellow had been b
rought to Rostop
chín and accus
ed of being a Fr
ench “spyer”
 (so Count Rosto
pchín had told 
"the
story), and"
 how Rostopchín
 let him go and 
assured the peop
le that he was 
“not a spire a
"t all, but only "
an old German ru
in.”  “Peo
ple are being ar
rested...” sai
d the count. “
I’ve told the 
countess she sh
ould not speak F
rench so much. I
t’s not the ti
me for it now.�
�  “And have
 you heard?” S
hinshín asked. 
“Prince Golít
syn has engaged 
a master to tea
ch him Russian. 
It is becoming d
angerous to spea
k French in the
 streets.”  
“And how about
" you, Count Pete"
r Kirílych? If 
they call up the
" militia,
you t"
oo will have to 
"mount a horse,�"
� remarked the o
"ld count, addres"
sing Pierre.  
 Pierre had been
 silent and preo
ccupied all thro
"ugh dinner, seem"
ing not to gras
p what was said.
 He looked at th
e count.  “O
"h yes, the war,�"
�� he said. “N
o! What sort of 
warrior should I
 make? And yet 
everything is so
" strange, so str"
ange! I can’t 
make it out. I d
"on’t
know, I "
am very far from
 having military
" tastes, but in "
these times no 
one can answer f
or himself.” 
 After dinner t
he count settled
 himself comfort
ably in an easy 
chair and with 
a serious face a
"sked Sónya, who"
 was considered 
an excellent rea
"der,
to read th"
e appeal.  “
"To Moscow, our a"
ncient Capital! 
  “The enemy 
has entered the 
borders of Russi
a with immense f
orces. He comes
 to despoil our 
beloved country.
”  Sónya re
ad painstakingly
 in her high-pit
ched voice. The 
count listened 
with closed eyes
", heaving abrupt"
 sighs at certai
n passages.  N
atásha sat erec
"t, gazing with a"
 searching look 
now at her fathe
r and now at Pi
erre.  Pierre 
felt her eyes on
 him and tried n
ot to look round
. The countess 
shook her head d
isapprovingly an
d angrily at eve
ry solemn expres
sion in the man
ifesto. In all t
hese words she s
aw only that the
 danger threate
ning her son wou
ld not soon be o
"ver. Shinshín, "
with a sarcastic
 smile on his l
"ips, was evident"
ly preparing to 
make fun of anyt
hing that gave 
him the opportun
ity: Sónya’s 
"reading, any rem"
ark of the count
"’s, or
even t"
he manifesto its
elf should no be
tter pretext pre
sent itself.  
After reading ab
out the dangers 
that threatened 
"Russia, the hope"
s the Emperor p
laced on Moscow 
and especially o
n its illustriou
"s nobility,
Só"
"nya, with a quiv"
er in her voice 
due chiefly to t
he attention tha
t was being pai
"d to her, read t"
he last words: 
 “We ourselve
s will not delay
 to appear among
 our people in t
hat Capital and
 in other parts 
of our realm for
" consultation, a"
nd for the direc
tion of all our
" levies, both th"
ose now barring 
the enemy’s pa
th and those fr
eshly formed to 
defeat him where
ver he may appea
r. May the ruin 
he hopes to bri
ng upon us recoi
l on his own hea
"d, and may Europ"
e delivered fro
m bondage glorif
y the name of Ru
ssia!”   �
"�Yes, that’s i"
t!” cried the 
"count, opening h"
is moist eyes an
d sniffing repe
"atedly, as if a "
strong vinaigret
te had been held
 to his nose; an
"d he
added, “"
Let the Emperor 
but say the word
 and we’ll sac
rifice everythin
g and begrudge 
nothing.”  B
efore Shinshín 
had time to utte
r the joke he wa
s ready to make 
on the count’
"s patriotism, Na"
tásha jumped up
 from her place 
and ran to her 
father.  “Wh
at a darling our
 Papa is!” she
" cried, kissing "
"him, and she aga"
in looked at Pi
erre with the un
conscious coquet
ry that had retu
rned to her wit
h her better spi
rits.  “Ther
e! Here’s a pa
triot for you!�
� said Shinshín
.  “Not a pa
"triot at all, bu"
t simply...” N
atásha replied 
in an injured t
one. “Everythi
ng seems funny t
"o you, but this "
isn’t at all a
 joke....”  
“A joke indeed
!” put in the 
count. “Let hi
m but say the wo
rd and we’ll 
all go.... We’
re not Germans!�
��  “But did
" you notice, it "
"says, ‘for con"
sultation’?”
 said Pierre.  
 “Never mind w
hat it’s for..
..”  At this
" moment, Pétya,"
 to whom nobody 
was paying any a
"ttention, came u"
p to his father
 with a very flu
shed face and sa
id in his breaki
ng voice that w
as now deep and 
now shrill:  �

Pétya stopped

“when our Fath

      CHAP
TER XXI  After
 the definite re
fusal he had rec
"eived, Pétya we"
nt to his room 
and there locked
 himself in and 
wept bitterly. W
hen he came in t
"o tea,
silent, "
"morose, and with"
 tear-stained fa
"ce, everybody pr"
etended not to 
notice anything.
  Next day the
 Emperor arrived
" in Moscow, and "
several of the R
ostóvs’ dome
stic serfs begge
d permission to 
go to have a loo
k at him. That 
morning Pétya w
as a long time d
ressing and arra
nging his hair a
nd collar to lo
ok like a grown-
up man. He frown
ed before his lo
"oking glass,
ge"
"sticulated, shru"
gged his shoulde
"rs, and finally,"
 without saying 
a word to anyon
"e, took his cap "
and left the hou
se by the back d
"oor, trying to
"
avoid notice. P�
�tya decided to 
go straight to w
here the Emperor
 was and to exp
lain frankly to 
some gentleman-i
n-waiting (he im
agined the Emper
or to be always
 surrounded by g
entlemen-in-wait
"ing) that he, Co"
"unt Rostóv,
in"
 spite of his yo
uth wished to se
rve his country;
 that youth coul
d be no hindran
"ce to loyalty, a"
nd that he was r
eady to... While
"
dressing, Pét"
ya had prepared 
many fine things
 he meant to say
 to the gentlem
an-in-waiting. 
 It was on the 
very fact of bei
ng so young that
 Pétya counted 
for success in 
reaching the Emp
eror—he even t
hought how surpr
ised everyone wo
uld be at his y
outhfulness—an
d yet in the arr
angement of his 
collar and hair 
 and by his seda
te deliberate wa
lk he wished to 
appear a grown-u
p man. But the 
farther he went 
and the more his
 attention was d
iverted by the 
ever-increasing 
crowds moving to
ward the Krémli
"n, the less he r"
emembered to wa
lk with the seda
teness and delib
eration of a man
. As he approach
ed the Krémlin
 he even began t
o avoid being cr
ushed and resolu
tely stuck out 
his elbows in a 
menacing way. Bu
t within the Tri
nity Gateway he 
 was so pressed 
to the wall by p
eople who probab
ly were unaware 
of the patrioti
c intentions wit
h which he had c
ome that in spit
e of all his de
termination he h
"ad to give in, a"
nd stop while ca
rriages passed i
"n,
rumbling ben"
eath the archway
. Beside Pétya 
stood a peasant 
"woman, a
footma"
"n, two tradesmen"
", and a discharg"
ed soldier. Afte
r standing some 
 time in the gat
"eway, Pétya tri"
ed to move forwa
rd in front of t
he others witho
ut waiting for a
ll the carriages
" to pass, and he"
 began resolutel
y working his w
ay with his elbo
"ws, but the woma"
n just in front 
"of him, who
was"
 the first again
st whom he direc
"ted his efforts,"
 angrily shouted
 at him:  “
What are you sho
"ving for, young "
lordling? Don’
t you see we’r
e all standing 
still? Then why 
push?”  “A
nybody can shove
",” said the fo"
"otman, and also "
began working hi
s elbows to suc
h effect that he
 pushed Pétya i
nto a very filth
y corner of the 
 gateway.  Pé
tya wiped his pe
rspiring face wi
th his hands and
 pulled up the d
amp collar whic
h he had arrange
d so well at hom
e to seem like a
 man’s.  He 
felt that he no 
longer looked pr
"esentable, and f"
eared that if he
 were now to ap
proach the gentl
emen-in-waiting 
in that plight h
e would not be 
admitted to the 
Emperor. But it 
was impossible t
o smarten onesel
f up or move to
" another place, "
because of the c
rowd. One of the
 generals who d
rove past was an
 acquaintance of
 the Rostóvs’
", and Pétya tho"
ught of asking 
"his help, but ca"
me to the conclu
sion that that w
ould not be a m
anly thing to do
. When the carri
ages had all pas
"sed in, the crow"
"d,
carrying Pé"
"tya with it, str"
eamed forward in
to the Krémlin 
Square which wa
s already full o
f people. There 
were people not 
only in the squa
"re,
but everywh"
ere—on the slo
pes and on the r
oofs. As soon as
 Pétya found h
imself in the sq
uare he clearly 
heard the sound 
of bells and the
 joyous voices 
of the crowd tha
t filled the who
le Krémlin.  
For a while the 
crowd was less d
"ense, but sudden"
ly all heads wer
"e bared,
and ev"
eryone rushed fo
rward in one dir
ection. Pétya w
as being pressed
 so that he cou
ld scarcely brea
"the, and everybo"
"dy shouted, “H"
urrah! hurrah! 
hurrah!” Péty
a stood on tipto
e and pushed and
" pinched, but co"
uld see nothing
 except the peop
le about him.  
 All the faces b
ore the same exp
ression of excit
ement and enthus
iasm. A tradesm
an’s wife stan
ding beside Pét
"ya sobbed, and t"
he tears ran dow
n her cheeks. 
 “Father! Ang
el! Dear one!”
 she kept repeat
"ing, wiping away"
 her tears with
 her fingers.  
 “Hurrah!” w
as heard on all 
sides.  For a 
moment the crowd
" stood still, bu"
t then it made a
nother rush for
ward.  Quite b
"eside himself, P"
"étya, clinching"
 his teeth and r
olling his eyes 
"
ferociously, pu"
"shed forward, el"
bowing his way a
nd shouting “h
urrah!” as if
 he were prepare
d that instant t
o kill himself a
nd everyone else
", but
on both s"
ides of him othe
r people with si
milarly ferociou
s faces pushed 
forward and ever
ybody shouted �
�hurrah!”  �
��So this is wha
t the Emperor is
!” thought Pé
"tya. “No, I ca"
n’t petition 
him myself—tha
t would be too b
old.” But in s
pite of this he 
continued to st
ruggle desperate
"ly forward, and "
from between the
 backs of those 
 in front he cau
ght glimpses of 
an open space wi
th a strip of re
d cloth spread 
out on it; but j
ust then the cro
wd swayed back�
�the police in 
front were pushi
ng back those wh
o had pressed to
o close to the 
procession: the 
Emperor was pass
ing from the pal
ace to the Cathe
dral of the Ass
umption—and P�
�tya unexpectedl
y received such 
a blow on his si
de and ribs and
 was squeezed so
 hard that sudde
nly everything g
rew dim before 
his eyes and he 
lost consciousne
ss. When he came
" to himself, a
"
man of clerical 
appearance with 
a tuft of gray h
air at the back 
of his head and
 wearing a shabb
y blue cassock�
�probably a chur
ch clerk and ch
anter—was hold
ing him under th
e arm with one h
and while wardin
g off the press
ure of the crowd
 with the other.
  “You’ve 
crushed the youn
g gentleman!” 
said the clerk. 
“What are you 
up to? Gently!.
.. They’ve cru
"shed him, crushe"
d him!”  The
 Emperor entered
 the Cathedral o
f the Assumption
. The crowd spre
ad out again mo
"re evenly, and t"
he clerk led Pé
tya—pale and b
reathless—to 
the Tsar-cannon.
 Several people 
were sorry for P
"étya, and sudde"
nly a crowd tur
ned toward him a
nd pressed round
 him. Those who 
stood nearest h
im attended to h
"im, unbuttoned h"
"is coat, seated "
him on the raise
d platform of t
"he cannon, and r"
eproached those 
others (whoever 
they might be) 
who had crushed 
him.  “One m
ight easily get 
killed that way!
 What do they me
an by it? Killin
g people! Poor 
"dear, he’s as "
white as a sheet
!”—various v
oices were heard
 saying.  Pé
tya soon came to
" himself, the co"
lor returned to 
"his face, the pa"
"in had
passed, "
and at the cost 
of that temporar
y unpleasantness
 he had obtained
 a place by the
 cannon from whe
re he hoped to s
ee the Emperor w
ho would be ret
urning that way.
 Pétya no longe
r thought of pre
senting his pet
ition. If he cou
ld only see the 
Emperor he would
 be happy!  Wh
ile the service 
was proceeding i
n the Cathedral 
of the Assumptio
n—it was a co
mbined service o
f prayer on the 
occasion of the 
Emperor’s arr
ival and of than
ksgiving for the
 conclusion of p
eace with the T
urks—the crowd
 outside spread 
out and hawkers 
"appeared, sellin"
"g kvass,
ginger"
"bread, and poppy"
seed sweets (of 
which Pétya was
 particularly f
"ond), and ordina"
ry conversation 
could again be h
eard. A tradesma
n’s wife was 
showing a rent i
n her shawl and 
telling how much
 the shawl had 
cost; another wa
s saying that al
l silk goods had
 now got dear. T
he clerk who ha
d rescued Pétya
 was talking to 
a functionary ab
out the priests 
who were offici
ating that day w
ith the bishop. 
The clerk severa
l times used th
e word “plenar
y” (of the ser
"vice), a word P�"
�tya did not und
erstand. Two yo
ung citizens wer
e joking with so
me serf girls wh
o were cracking 
 nuts. All these
" conversations, "
especially the j
oking with the g
"irls,
were such"
 as might have h
ad a particular 
charm for Pétya
" at his age, but"
 they did not i
nterest him now.
 He sat on his e
levation—the p
edestal of the 
cannon—still a
gitated as befor
e by the thought
 of the Emperor 
and by his love
 for him. The fe
eling of pain an
d fear he had ex
perienced when 
he was being cru
"shed, together w"
ith that of rapt
"ure, still furth"
er intensified 
his sense of the
 importance of t
he occasion.  
Suddenly the sou
nd of a firing o
f cannon was hea
rd from the emba
"nkment,
to cele"
brate the signin
g of peace with 
"the Turks, and t"
he crowd rushed 
 impetuously tow
ard the embankme
nt to watch the 
firing. Pétya t
oo would have r
"un there, but th"
e clerk who had 
taken the young 
gentleman under 
 his protection 
stopped him. The
 firing was stil
l proceeding whe
"n
officers, gen"
"erals, and gentl"
emen-in-waiting 
came running out
 of the cathedr
"al, and after th"
em others in a m
ore leisurely ma
nner: caps were 
"
again raised, a"
nd those who had
 run to look at 
the cannon ran b
ack again. At l
ast four men in 
uniforms and sas
hes emerged from
 the cathedral 
doors. “Hurrah
! hurrah!” sho
uted the crowd a
gain.  “Whic
h is he? Which?�
�� asked Pétya 
in a tearful voi
"ce, of those aro"
"und
him, but no"
 one answered hi
"m, everybody was"
 too excited; an
"d Pétya,
fixin"
g on one of thos
"e four men, whom"
 he could not cl
early see for th
e tears of joy 
that filled his 
"eyes, concentrat"
ed all his enthu
siasm on him—
though it happen
ed not to be the
 Emperor—frant
ically shouted 
“Hurrah!” an
d resolved that 
"tomorrow, come w"
"hat might, he wo"
uld join the ar
my.  The crowd
 ran after the E
"mperor, followed"
 him to the pala
"ce, and began
t"
o disperse. It w
"as already late,"
 and Pétya had 
not eaten anythi
ng and was dren
ched with perspi
"ration, yet he d"
id not go home b
ut stood with t
"hat diminishing,"
 but still consi
"derable, crowd b"
efore the palace
 while the Empe
ror dined—look
ing in at the pa
"lace windows, ex"
pecting he knew 
"
not what, and e"
nvying alike the
 notables he saw
 arriving at the
 entrance to di
ne with the Empe
ror and the cour
t footmen who se
"rved at table,
"
glimpses of whom
 could be seen t
hrough the windo
ws.  While the
 Emperor was din
"ing, Valúev, lo"
oking out of the
" window, said:
"
 “The people 
are still hoping
 to see Your Maj
esty again.” 
 The dinner was
" nearly over, an"
"d the Emperor, m"
unching a biscui
"t, rose
and wen"
t out onto the b
alcony. The peop
"le, with Pétya "
"among them, rush"
ed toward the b
alcony.  “An
gel! Dear one! H
urrah! Father!..
.” cried the c
"rowd, and Pétya"
" with
it, and a"
gain the women a
nd men of weaker
" mold, Pétya am"
"ong them, wept
"
with joy.  A l
argish piece of 
the biscuit the 
Emperor was hold
ing in his hand 
"broke
off, fell"
 on the balcony 
"parapet, and the"
n to the ground.
 A coachman in 
"a jerkin, who st"
"ood nearest, spr"
ang forward and 
snatched it up. 
Several people 
in the crowd rus
hed at the coach
man. Seeing this
 the Emperor had
 a plateful of 
biscuits brought
 him and began t
hrowing them dow
n from the balc
ony. Pétya’s 
eyes grew bloods
"hot, and still m"
ore excited by t
he danger of be
"ing crushed, he "
rushed at the bi
scuits. He did n
"ot know why,
bu"
t he had to have
 a biscuit from 
the Tsar’s han
d and he felt th
at he must not 
give way. He spr
ang forward and 
upset an old wom
an who was catc
hing at a biscui
t; the old woman
 did not conside
r herself defeat
ed though she w
as lying on the 
ground—she gra
bbed at some bis
cuits but her h
and did not reac
h them. Pétya p
ushed her hand a
way with his kne
"e,
seized a bis"
"cuit, and as if "
fearing to be to
"o late, again sh"
outed “Hurrah
!” with a voic
e already hoarse
.  The Emperor
" went in, and af"
ter that the gre
ater part of the
 crowd began to
 disperse.  �
�There! I said i
f only we waited
—and so it was
!” was being j
oyfully said by
 various people.
  Happy as Pé
"tya was, he felt"
 sad at having t
o go home knowin
g that all the 
enjoyment of tha
t day was over. 
He did not go st
raight home from
"
the Krémlin, "
but called on hi
s friend Obolén
"ski, who was fif"
teen and was al
so entering the 
regiment. On ret
urning home Pét
ya announced res
olutely and fir
mly that if he w
as not allowed t
o enter the serv
ice he would ru
n away. And next
" day, Count Ily�"
� Rostóv—thou
gh he had not ye
t quite yielded
—went to inqui
re how he could 
arrange for Pét
ya to serve wher
e there would b
e least danger. 
      CHAPT
ER XXII  Two d
"ays later, on th"
e fifteenth of J
"uly, an immense "
number of carria
ges were standi
ng outside the S
lobóda Palace. 
  The great hal
ls were full. In
 the first were 
the nobility and
 gentry in thei
"r uniforms, in t"
he second bearde
d merchants in f
ull-skirted coat
s of blue cloth
 and wearing med
als. In the nobl
emen’s hall th
ere was an ince
ssant movement a
nd buzz of voice
s. The chief mag
nates sat on hi
gh-backed chairs
 at a large tabl
e under the port
rait of the Empe
"ror,
but most o"
f the gentry wer
e strolling abou
t the room.  A
"ll these nobles,"
 whom Pierre met
 every day at th
e Club or in the
"ir own
houses, "
were in uniform�
��some in that o
f Catherine’s 
"day, others in t"
hat of Emperor 
"Paul, others aga"
in in the new un
iforms of Alexan
der’s time or 
 the ordinary un
iform of the nob
"ility, and the g"
eneral character
istic of being 
in uniform impar
ted something st
range and fantas
tic to these di
verse and famili
ar personalities
", both old and y"
oung. The old me
"n,
dim-eyed, to"
"othless, bald, s"
"allow, and bloat"
"ed, or gaunt and"
" wrinkled,
were"
 especially stri
king. For the mo
st part they sat
 quietly in thei
r places and we
"re silent, or, i"
f they walked ab
"out and talked, "
attached themse
lves to someone 
younger. On all 
"these faces, as "
on the faces of
 the crowd Péty
a had seen in th
"e Square, there "
was a striking 
contradiction: t
he general expec
tation of a sole
"mn event, and at"
 the same time 
the everyday int
erests in a bost
"on card party, P"
"eter the cook,
"
Zinaída Dmítri
"evna’s health,"
 and so on.  P
ierre was there 
"too, buttoned up"
 since early mor
ning in a noblem
an’s uniform 
that had become 
too tight for hi
m. He was agitat
ed; this extrao
rdinary gatherin
g not only of no
bles but also of
 the merchant-c
lass—les état
s généraux (St
ates-General)—
evoked in him a 
whole series of
 ideas he had lo
ng laid aside bu
t which were dee
ply graven in h
is soul: thought
s of the Contrat
 Social and the 
French Revolutio
n. The words th
at had struck hi
m in the Emperor
’s appeal—th
at the sovereign
 was coming to 
the capital for 
consultation wit
h his people—s
trengthened this
 idea. And imag
ining that in th
is direction som
ething important
 which he had l
ong awaited was 
"drawing near, he"
 strolled about 
watching and li
stening to conve
"rsations, but no"
where finding an
y confirmation o
f the ideas tha
t occupied him. 
  The Emperor�
�s manifesto was
" read, evoking e"
"nthusiasm, and t"
hen all moved a
bout discussing 
it. Besides the 
ordinary topics 
"of conversation,"
 Pierre heard q
uestions of wher
e the marshals o
f the nobility w
ere to stand whe
n the Emperor e
"ntered, when a b"
all should be gi
ven in the Emper
"or’s
honor, w"
hether they shou
ld group themsel
ves by districts
 or by whole pr
ovinces... and s
o on; but as soo
n as the war was
" touched on, or"
 what the nobili
ty had been conv
"ened for, the ta"
lk became undeci
ded and indefin
ite. Then all pr
eferred listenin
g to speaking. 
 A middle-aged 
"man, handsome an"
"d virile, in the"
 uniform of a re
tired naval off
"icer, was speaki"
ng in one of the
" rooms, and a sm"
all crowd was p
ressing round hi
m. Pierre went u
p to the circle 
that had formed 
round the speak
er and listened.
 Count Ilyá Ros
"tóv, in a milit"
ary uniform of 
Catherine’s ti
"me, was saunteri"
ng with a pleasa
nt smile among t
"he crowd,
with "
all of whom he w
as acquainted. H
e too approached
 that group and 
 listened with a
 kindly smile an
d nods of approv
"al, as he always"
" did,
to what t"
he speaker was s
aying. The retir
ed naval man was
 speaking very 
"boldly, as was e"
vident from the 
expression on th
e faces of the l
isteners and fr
om the fact that
 some people Pie
rre knew as the 
meekest and qui
etest of men wal
ked away disappr
ovingly or expre
ssed disagreemen
t with him. Pie
rre pushed his w
ay into the midd
"le of the group,"
" listened,
and "
convinced himsel
f that the man w
as indeed a libe
"ral, but of view"
s quite differe
nt from his own.
 The naval offic
er spoke in a pa
rticularly sono
"rous, musical, a"
nd aristocratic 
"baritone voice, "
pleasantly swal
lowing his r’s
 and generally s
lurring his cons
onants: the voic
e of a man call
ing out to his s
"ervant, “Heah!"
 Bwing me my pip
e!” It was in
dicative of diss
ipation and the 
exercise of auth
ority.  “Wha
t if the Smolén

All that did was

 Count Ilyá Ro

ndly and nodded 
approval.  “
And was our mili

o the Empia? Not

eferred to the 
Emperor) “need

!” added the 
orator with anim
ation.  Count 
Rostóv’s mout
h watered with p
leasure and he n
"udged Pierre, bu"
t Pierre wanted
 to speak himsel
f. He pushed for
"ward, feeling st"
"irred,
but not "
yet sure what st
irred him or wha
t he would say. 
Scarcely had he 
 opened his mout
h when one of th
"e senators, a ma"
n without a toot
"h in his
head, "
with a shrewd th
ough angry expre
"ssion, standing "
near the first 
"speaker, interru"
pted him. Eviden
tly accustomed t
o managing debat
es and to maint
aining an argume
"nt, he began in "
low but distinct
 tones:  “I 
"imagine, sir,”"
" said he, mumbli"
ng with his toot
"hless mouth, “"
that we have be
en summoned here
 not to discuss 
whether it’s b
est for the empi
re at the prese
nt moment to ado
pt conscription 
or to call out t
he militia. We 
have been summon
ed to reply to t
he appeal with w
hich our soverei
gn the Emperor 
has honored us. 
But to judge wha
t is best—cons
cription or the
 militia—we ca
n leave to the s
upreme authority
....”  Pierr
e suddenly saw a
n outlet for his
 excitement. He 
hardened his hea
rt against the 
senator who was 
introducing this
 set and narrow 
attitude into t
he deliberations
 of the nobility
. Pierre stepped
 forward and in
terrupted him. H
e himself did no
t yet know what 
"he would say, bu"
t he began to s
"peak eagerly, oc"
casionally lapsi
ng into French o
r expressing hi
mself in bookish
 Russian.  “
"Excuse me, your "
"excellency,” h"
e began. (He was
 well acquainted
 with the senat
"or, but thought "
it necessary on 
this occasion to
 address him fo
rmally.) “Thou
gh I don’t agr
ee with the gent
leman...” (he 
hesitated: he w
"ished to say, �"
�Mon très honor
able préopinant
”—“My very
 honorable oppo
nent”) “with
 the gentleman..
. whom I have no
t the honor of k
"nowing,
I suppo"
se that the nobi

ummoned not mere
ly to express t
heir sympathy an
d enthusiasm but
 also to conside
r the means by w
hich we can ass
ist our Fatherla
"nd! I imagine,�"
"� he went on, wa"
rming to his su
"bject, “that t"
he Emperor himse

d chair à cano

to obtain from 
us any co-co-cou

* “Food for ca
nnon.”   Ma
ny persons withd
rew from the cir
"cle, noticing th"
e senator’s sa
rcastic smile a
nd the freedom o
f Pierre’s rem
arks. Only Count
 Rostóv was ple
ased with them 
as he had been p
leased with thos
e of the naval o
"fficer, the
sen"
"ator, and in gen"
eral with whatev
er speech he had
 last heard.  
“I think that 
before discussin
g these question
"s,” Pierre con"
"tinued, “we
s"
hould ask the Em
peror—most res
pectfully ask Hi
s Majesty—to l
et us know the 
number of our tr
oops and the pos
ition in which o
ur army and our 
"
forces now are,"
 and then...” 
  But scarcely 
had Pierre utter
ed these words b
efore he was att
acked from thre
e sides. The mos
t vigorous attac
k came from an o
"ld acquaintance,"
 a boston playe
r who had always
 been well dispo
"sed toward him, "
Stepán Stepán
ovich Adráksin.
 Adráksin was i
"n uniform, and w"
hether as a resu
lt of the unifo
rm or from some 
other cause Pier
re saw before hi
m quite a diffe
rent man. With a
 sudden expressi
on of malevolenc
e on his aged fa
"ce,
Adráksin s"
houted at Pierre
:  “In the f
"irst place, I te"
ll you we have n
o right to quest
ion the Emperor 
"
about that, and"
" secondly, if th"
e Russian nobili
ty had that righ
"t, the
Emperor "
could not answer
 such a question
. The troops are
 moved accordin
g to the enemy�
�s movements and
 the number of m
en increases and
 decreases....�
��  Another vo
"ice, that of a n"
obleman of mediu
m height and abo
ut forty years 
"of age, whom Pie"
rre had formerly
 met at the gyps
ies’ and knew 
as a bad cardpl
"ayer, and who, a"
lso transformed 
"by his uniform, "
came up to Pierr
"e,
interrupted "
Adráksin.  �
"�Yes, and this i"
s not a time for
" discussing,” "
"he continued, �"
�but for acting
: there is war i
n Russia! The en
emy is advancing
 to destroy Rus
"sia, to desecrat"
e the tombs of o
"ur fathers, to c"
arry off our wiv
es and children
.” The noblema
n smote his brea
st. “We will a
"ll arise,
every"
one of us will g
"o, for our fathe"
r the Tsar!” h
"e shouted, rolli"
ng his bloodsho
t eyes. Several 
approving voices
 were heard in t
he crowd. “We

d will not grudg
e our blood in d
efense of our fa

the throne"
", and the Father"
land! We must ce
ase raving if we
 are sons of ou
r Fatherland! We
 will show Europ
e how Russia ris
es to the defens
e of Russia!”
  Pierre wishe
"d to reply, but "
could not get in
 a word. He felt
 that his words
", apart from wha"
t meaning they c
"onveyed, were le"
ss audible than 
the sound of hi
s opponent’s v
oice.  Count R
ostóv at the ba
ck of the crowd 
was expressing a
pproval; several
"
persons, brisk"
ly turning a sho
ulder to the ora
tor at the end o
"f a
phrase, sai"
d:  “That’
"s right, quite r"
ight! Just so!�
�  Pierre wish
ed to say that h
e was ready to s
acrifice his mon
"ey, his
serfs, "
"or himself, only"
 one ought to kn
ow the state of 
affairs in orde
r to be able to 
"improve it, but "
he was unable to
 speak. Many voi
ces shouted and
 talked at the s
"ame time, so tha"
t Count Rostóv 
had not time to
 signify his app
roval of them al
"l, and the group"
" increased, disp"
"ersed,
re-forme"
"d, and then move"
d with a hum of 
talk into the la
rgest hall and 
to the big table
. Not only was P
ierre’s attemp
t to speak unsuc
"cessful,
but he"
 was rudely inte
"rrupted, pushed "
"aside, and peopl"
e turned away f
rom him as from 
a common enemy. 
This happened no
t because they w
ere displeased 
by the substance
" of his speech, "
which had even b
een forgotten a
fter the many su
bsequent speeche
"s, but to animat"
e it the crowd n
eeded a tangibl
e object to love
 and a tangible 
object to hate. 
Pierre became th
e latter. Many 
other orators sp
oke after the ex
"cited nobleman, "
and all in the 
same tone. Many 
spoke eloquently
 and with origin
ality.  Glínk
"a, the editor of"
 the Russian Mes
"senger, who was "
recognized (crie
s of “author!
 author!” were
 heard in the cr
"owd), said that "
“hell must be 
 repulsed by hel
"l,” and that h"
e had seen a chi
ld smiling at li
ghtning flashes
 and thunderclap
"s, but “we wil"
l not be that ch
ild.”  “Ye
"s, yes, at thund"
erclaps!” was 
repeated approvi
ngly in the back
 rows of the cr
owd.  The crow
d drew up to the
" large table, at"
 which sat gray-
haired or bald 
seventy-year-old
" magnates, unifo"
rmed and besashe
"d, almost all of"
 whom Pierre ha
d seen in their 
own homes with t
"heir buffoons, o"
r playing bosto
n at the clubs. 
With an incessan
t hum of voices 
the crowd advanc
ed to the table
. Pressed by the
 throng against 
the high backs o
"f the
chairs, t"
he orators spoke
 one after anoth
er and sometimes
 two together. 
Those standing b
ehind noticed wh
at a speaker omi
tted to say and 
hastened to sup
ply it. Others i
n that heat and 
crush racked the
ir brains to fin
d some thought 
and hastened to 
utter it. The ol
"d magnates, whom"
" Pierre
knew, s"
at and turned to
 look first at o
ne and then at a
"nother, and thei"
r faces for the
 most part only 
expressed the fa
ct that they fou
nd it very hot.
" Pierre, however"
", felt excited, "
and the general 
desire to show t
hat they were r
eady to go to al
l lengths—whic
h found expressi
on in the tones 
 and looks more 
than in the subs
tance of the spe
eches—infected
 him too. He di
d not renounce h
"is opinions, but"
 felt himself in
 some way to bla
me and wished t
o justify himsel
f.  “I only 
said that it wou
ld be more to th
e purpose to mak
e sacrifices wh
en we know what 
is needed!” sa
"id he, trying to"
 be heard above 
the other voice
s.  One of the
 old men nearest
 to him looked r
"ound, but his at"
tention was imm
ediately diverte
d by an exclamat
ion at the other
 side of the tab
"le.

“Yes, M"
oscow will be su
rrendered! She w
ill be our expia
tion!” shouted
 one man.  �
�He is the enemy
 of mankind!” 
cried another. �
��Allow me to sp
eak....” “G
"entlemen, you ar"
e crushing me!..
.”      
CHAPTER XXIII  
 At that moment 
Count Rostopchí
n with his protr
uding chin and a
"lert eyes,
wear"
ing the uniform 
of a general wit
h sash over his 
"shoulder, entere"
"d
the room, ste"
pping briskly to
 the front of th
e crowd of gentr
y.  “Our sov
ereign the Emper
or will be here 
"in a moment,” "
said Rostopchín
. “I am strai
ght from the pal
ace. Seeing the 
position we are 
"in, I think
the"
re is little nee
d for discussion
. The Emperor ha
s deigned to sum
mon us and the 
merchants. Milli
ons will pour fo
rth from there�
�—he pointed 
to the merchants
’ hall—“bu
t our business i
s to supply men 
and not spare o
urselves.... Tha
t is the least w
e can do!”  
A conference too
k place confined
 to the magnates
 sitting at the 
table. The whol
e consultation p
assed more than 
quietly. After a
ll the preceding
 noise the soun
d of their old v
oices saying one
" after another, "
"“I
agree,” "
"or for variety, "
“I too am of t
"hat opinion,” "
and so on had ev
en a mournful e
ffect.  The se
cretary was told
 to write down t
he resolution of
 the Moscow nob
ility and gentry
", that they woul"
d furnish ten me
"n, fully equippe"
"d,
out of every"
" thousand serfs,"
 as the Smoléns
k gentry had don
e. Their chairs
 made a scraping
 noise as the ge
ntlemen who had 
conferred rose 
with apparent re
"lief, and began "
walking up and d
"own, arm in arm,"
 to stretch the
ir legs and conv
erse in couples.
  “The Emper
or! The Emperor!
” a sudden cry
 resounded throu
gh the halls and
 the whole thro
ng hurried to th
e entrance.  T
he Emperor enter
ed the hall thro
ugh a broad path
 between two lin
es of nobles. E
very face expres
"sed respectful, "
awe-struck curio
sity. Pierre st
ood rather far o
ff and could not
 hear all that t
he Emperor said.
 From what he d
id hear he under
stood that the E
mperor spoke of 
the danger thre
atening the empi
re and of the ho
pes he placed on
 the Moscow nob
ility. He was an
swered by a voic
e which informed
 him of the res
olution just arr
ived at.  “G
entlemen!” sai
d the Emperor wi
th a quivering v
oice.  There w
as a rustling am
ong the crowd an
d it again subsi
"ded, so that
Pi"
erre distinctly 
heard the pleasa
ntly human voice
 of the Emperor 
saying with emo
tion:  “I ne
ver doubted the 
devotion of the 
"Russian nobles, "
but today it has
 surpassed my e
xpectations. I t
hank you in the 
name of the Fath
erland! Gentlem
"en, let us act! "
Time is most pre
cious....”  
The Emperor ceas
"ed speaking, the"
 crowd began pre
"ssing round him,"
 and rapturous 
exclamations wer
e heard from all
 sides.  “Ye
"s, most precious"
... a royal word
",” said Count "
"Rostóv, with a "
sob. He stood a
"t the back, and,"
 though he had h
eard hardly anyt
"hing, understood"
 everything in 
his own way.  
From the hall of
 the nobility th
e Emperor went t
o that of the me
rchants. There 
he remained abou
t ten minutes. P
ierre was among 
those who saw hi
m come out from
 the merchants�
� hall with tear
s of emotion in 
his eyes. As be
came known later
", he had scarcel"
y begun to addre
ss the merchants
 before tears g
ushed from his e
yes and he concl
uded in a trembl
ing voice. When
 Pierre saw the 
Emperor he was c
oming out accomp
anied by two me
"rchants, one of "
whom Pierre knew
", a fat otkupshc"
hík. The other 
"was
the mayor, "
a man with a thi
n sallow face an
d narrow beard. 
Both were weepi
ng. Tears filled
 the thin man’
"s eyes, and the "
fat otkupshchík
 sobbed outrigh
t like a child a
nd kept repeatin
g:  “Our liv
es and property�
"��take them, You"
r Majesty!”  
 Pierre’s one 
feeling at the m
oment was a desi
re to show that 
he was ready to
 go all lengths 
and was prepared
 to sacrifice ev
erything. He now
 felt ashamed o
f his speech wit
h its constituti
onal tendency an
d sought an opp
ortunity of effa
cing it. Having 
heard that Count
 Mamónov was f
urnishing a regi
"ment, Bezúkhov "
at once informed
 Rostopchín tha
t he would give
 a thousand men 
and their mainte
nance.  Old Ro
stóv could not 
tell his wife of
 what had passed
" without tears, "
and at once con
sented to Pétya
’s request and
 went himself to
 enter his name.
  Next day the
 Emperor left Mo
scow. The assemb
led nobles all t
ook off their u
niforms and sett
led down again i
n their homes an
"d clubs, and not"
 without some g
roans gave order
s to their stewa
rds about the en
"rollment,
feeli"
ng amazed themse
lves at what the
y had done.   
    BOOK TEN:
 1812      
 CHAPTER I  Na
poleon began the
 war with Russia
 because he coul
d not resist goi
"ng
to Dresden, "
could not help h
aving his head t
urned by the hom
age he received
", could not help"
 donning a Polis
h uniform and yi
elding to the s
timulating influ
ence of a June m
"orning, and coul"
d not refrain fr
om bursts of an
ger in the prese
nce of Kurákin 
and then of Bala
shëv.  Alexan
der refused nego
tiations because
 he felt himself
 to be personall
y insulted. Bar
clay de Tolly tr
ied to command t
he army in the b
"est
way, becaus"
e he wished to f
ulfill his duty 
and earn fame as
 a great comman
der. Rostóv cha
rged the French 
because he could
 not restrain h
is wish for a ga
llop across a le
vel field; and i
n the same way t
he innumerable 
people who took 
part in the war 
acted in accord 
with their pers
onal characteris
"tics, habits, ci"
"rcumstances, and"
 aims. They were
 moved by fear 
"or vanity, rejoi"
ced or were indi
"gnant, reasoned,"
 imagining that
 they knew what 
they were doing 
and did it of th
eir own free wil
"l,
but they all"
 were involuntar
y tools of histo
"ry, carrying on "
a work conceale
d from them but 
comprehensible t
o us. Such is th
e inevitable fa
te of men of act
"ion, and the hig"
her they stand i
n the social hie
rarchy the less
 are they free. 
  The actors of
 1812 have long 
since left the s
"tage, their pers"
onal interests 
have vanished le
"aving no trace, "
and nothing rema
ins of that tim
e but its histor
ic results.  P
rovidence compel
led all these me
"n, striving to a"
ttain personal a
"ims, to
further"
 the accomplishm
ent of a stupend
ous result no on
e of them at all
 expected—nei
"ther Napoleon, n"
"or Alexander, no"
r still less any
 of those who d
id the actual fi
ghting.  The c
ause of the dest
ruction of the F
rench army in 18
12 is clear to u
s now. No one w
ill deny that th
"at cause was, on"
" the one hand, i"
ts advance into
 the heart of Ru
ssia late in the
 season without 
any preparation 
for a winter ca
"mpaign and, on t"
"he other, the ch"
aracter given to
 the war by the
 burning of Russ
ian towns and th
e hatred of the 
foe this aroused
 among the Russ
ian people. But 
no one at the ti
me foresaw (what
 now seems so e
vident) that thi
s was the only w
ay an army of ei
ght hundred thou
sand men—the 
best in the worl
d and led by the
 best general—
could be destroy
ed in conflict 
with a raw army 
of half its nume
"rical strength, "
and led by inex
perienced comman
ders as the Russ
ian army was. No
t only did no on
"e
see this, but"
 on the Russian 
side every effor
t was made to hi
nder the only t
hing that could 
"save Russia, whi"
le on the French
" side, despite
"
Napoleon’s exp
erience and so-c
alled military g
"enius, every eff"
ort was directe
d to pushing on 
to Moscow at the
 end of the summ
"er, that is, to"
 doing the very 
thing that was b
ound to lead to 
destruction.  
In historical wo
rks on the year 
1812 French writ
ers are very fon
d of saying tha
t Napoleon felt 
the danger of ex
tending his line
", that he
sough"
t a battle and t
hat his marshals
 advised him to 
stop at Smoléns
"k,
and of makin"
g similar statem
ents to show tha
t the danger of 
the campaign wa
s even then unde
rstood. Russian 
authors are stil
l fonder of tell
ing us that fro
m the commenceme
nt of the campai
gn a Scythian wa
r plan was adop
ted to lure Napo
leon into the de
"pths of Russia, "
and this plan so
me of them attr
"ibute to Pfuel, "
others to a cert
"ain Frenchman, o"
"thers to
Toll, "
and others again
 to Alexander hi
mself—pointing
" to notes, proje"
"cts,
and letter"
s which contain 
hints of such a 
line of action. 
But all these h
ints at what hap
"pened, both from"
 the French side
 and the Russian
", are
advanced "
only because the
y fit in with th
e event. Had tha
t event not occ
urred these hint
s would have bee
"n forgotten, as "
we have forgotte
n the thousands
 and millions of
 hints and expec
tations to the c
ontrary which w
ere current then
 but have now be
en forgotten bec
ause the event 
falsified them. 
There are always
 so many conject
ures as to the i
ssue of any eve
nt that however 
it may end there
 will always be 
people to say: 
“I said then t
hat it would be 
"so,” quite for"
getting that ami
d their innumer
able conjectures
 many were to qu
ite the contrary
 effect.  Conj
ectures as to Na
poleon’s aware
ness of the dang
er of extending 
"his
line, and ("
on the Russian s
ide) as to lurin
g the enemy into
 the depths of 
"Russia, are evid"
ently of that ki
"nd, and only by "
much straining c
an historians a
ttribute such co
nceptions to Nap
oleon and his ma
"rshals,
or such"
 plans to the Ru
ssian commanders
. All the facts 
are in flat con
tradiction to su
ch conjectures. 
During the whole
 period of the w
ar not only was
 there no wish o
n the Russian si
de to draw the F
rench into the 
heart of the cou
"ntry, but from t"
heir first entry
 into Russia ev
erything was don
e to stop them. 
And not only was
 Napoleon not af
raid to extend 
"his line, but he"
 welcomed every 
step forward as 
a triumph and d
id not seek batt
le as eagerly as
 in former campa
"igns, but very l"
azily.  At the
 very beginning 
of the war our a
rmies were divid
"ed, and our sole"
 aim was to uni
"te them, though "
uniting the armi
es was no advant
age if we meant
 to retire and l
ure the enemy in
to the depths of
 the country. Ou
r Emperor joine
d the army to en
courage it to de
fend every inch 
of Russian soil
 and not to retr
eat. The enormou
s Drissa camp wa
s formed on Pfue
"l’s
plan, and"
 there was no in
tention of retir
ing farther. The
 Emperor reproa
ched the command
ers in chief for
 every step they
 retired. He cou
ld not bear the
 idea of letting
 the enemy even 
"reach Smolénsk,"
 still less cou
ld he contemplat
e the burning of
" Moscow, and whe"
n our armies did
 unite he was d
ispleased that S
molénsk was aba
ndoned and burne
d without a gen
eral engagement 
having been foug
ht under its wal
ls.  So though
"t the Emperor, a"
nd the Russian c
ommanders and pe
ople were still 
 more provoked a
t the thought th
at our forces we
re retreating in
to the depths o
f the country. 
 Napoleon havin
g cut our armies
 apart advanced 
far into the cou
ntry and missed
 several chances
 of forcing an e
ngagement. In Au
gust he was at 
Smolénsk and th
ought only of ho
w to advance far
"ther, though as "
we now see that
 advance was evi
dently ruinous t
o him.  The fa
cts clearly show
 that Napoleon d
id not foresee t
he danger of the
 advance on Mos
"cow, nor did Ale"
xander and the R
ussian commander
s then think of
 luring Napoleon
" on, but quite t"
he contrary. The
 luring of Napo
leon into the de
pths of the coun
try was not the 
result of any pl

believed it to b

esulted from a m

ishes among thos
e who took part 
in the war and 
had no perceptio
n whatever of th
"e inevitable, or"
 of the one way
 of saving Russi
a. Everything ca
me about fortuit
ously. The armie
s were divided 
at the commencem

 on to Smolénsk
. But we withdre
w at an acute a

 advanced betwee

; the angle bec
ame still more a
cute and we with
drew still farth
"er, because
Bar"
clay de Tolly wa
s an unpopular f
oreigner dislike
d by Bagratión 
(who would come
 under his comma
"nd), and Bagrati"
ón—being in c
ommand of the s
econd army—tri
ed to postpone j
oining up and co
ming under Barcl
ay’s command 
as long as he co
uld. Bagratión 
was slow in effe
cting the junct
ion—though tha
t was the chief 
aim of all at he
adquarters—bec
"ause,
as he all"
"eged, he exposed"
 his army to dan
ger on this marc
"h, and it was
b"
est for him to r
etire more to th
e left and more 
"to the south, wo"
rrying the enem
y from flank and
 rear and securi
ng from the Ukra
ine recruits for
 his army; and 
it looks as if h
e planned this i
n order not to c
ome under the c
ommand of the de
tested foreigner
" Barclay, whose "
rank was inferio
r to his own. 
 The Emperor wa
s with the army 
"to encourage it,"
 but his presenc
e and ignorance
 of what steps t
"o take, and the "
enormous number 
of advisers and 
"
plans, destroye"
d the first army
’s energy and 
it retired.  T
he intention was
 to make a stand
 at the Drissa c
"amp, but Paulucc"
"i,
aiming at be"
coming commander
" in chief, unexp"
ectedly employed
 his energy to 
influence Alexan
"der, and Pfuel�"
�s whole plan wa
s abandoned and 
the command ent
rusted to Barcla
y. But as Barcla
y did not inspir
e confidence hi
s power was limi
ted. The armies 
"were divided, th"
ere was no unity
" of
command, an"
d Barclay was un
popular; but fro
m this confusion
", division,
and"
 the unpopularit
y of the foreign
 commander in ch
"ief, there resul"
ted on the one 
hand indecision 
and the avoidanc
e of a battle (w
hich we could n
ot have refraine
d from had the a
rmies been unite
d and had someon
"e else,
instead"
" of Barclay, bee"
n in command) an
d on the other a
n ever-increasin
g indignation a
gainst the forei
gners and an inc
rease in patriot
ic zeal.  At l
ast the Emperor 
"left the army, a"
nd as the most c
onvenient and in
deed the only p
retext for his d
eparture it was 
decided that it 
was necessary f
or him to inspir
e the people in 
the capitals and
 arouse the nati
on in general t
o a patriotic wa
r. And by this v
isit of the Empe
ror to Moscow t
he strength of t
he Russian army 
was trebled.  
He left in order
 not to obstruct
 the commander i
n chief’s undi
vided control o
"f the army, and "
hoping that more
 decisive action
 would then be 
"taken, but the c"
ommand of the ar
mies became stil
l more confused 
and enfeebled. 
"Bennigsen, the T"
"sarévich, and a"
 swarm of adjuta
nts general rem
ained with the a
rmy to keep the 
commander in chi
ef under observa
tion and arouse
" his energy, and"
" Barclay, feelin"
g less free than
 ever under the
 observation of 
all these “eye
s of the Emperor
",” became stil"
l more cautious
 of undertaking 
any decisive act
ion and avoided 
giving battle. 
 Barclay stood 
for caution. The
 Tsarévich hint
ed at treachery 
and demanded a 
general engageme
"nt. Lubomírski,"
" Bronnítski, Wl"
"ocki, and the
o"
thers of that gr
oup stirred up s
o much trouble t
"hat Barclay, und"
er pretext of s
ending papers to
" the Emperor, di"
spatched these P
olish adjutants
 general to Pete
rsburg and plung
ed into an open 
struggle with B
ennigsen and the
 Tsarévich.  
At Smolénsk the
 armies at last 
"reunited, much a"
s Bagratión dis
liked it.  Bag
ratión drove up
 in a carriage t
o the house occu
pied by Barclay.
 Barclay donned
 his sash and ca
me out to meet a
nd report to his
 senior officer
 Bagratión.  
Despite his seni
ority in rank Ba
"gratión, in thi"
s contest of mag
"nanimity,
took "
his orders from 
"Barclay, but, ha"
"ving submitted, "
agreed with him 
 less than ever.
 By the Emperor�
��s orders Bagra
tión reported d
irect to him. H
e wrote to Arakc
"héev, the Emper"
or’s confidant
: “It must be 
as my sovereign
" pleases, but I "
cannot work with
 the Minister (m
eaning Barclay)
. For God’s sa
ke send me somew
here else if onl
y in command of 
 a regiment. I c
annot stand it h
ere. Headquarter
s are so full of
 Germans that a
 Russian cannot 
exist and there 
is no sense in a
nything. I thoug
ht I was really
 serving my sove
reign and the Fa
"therland, but it"
 turns out that
 I am serving Ba
rclay. I confess
 I do not want t
o.”  The swa
rm of Bronnítsk
is and Wintzinge
rodes and their 
like still furth
er embittered t
he relations bet
ween the command
"ers in chief, an"
d even less uni
ty resulted. Pre
parations were m
ade to fight the
 French before 
Smolénsk. A gen
eral was sent to
 survey the posi
tion. This gener
"al,
hating Barc"
"lay, rode to vis"
it a friend of h
"is own, a corps "
"commander,
and,"
 having spent th
"e day with him, "
returned to Barc
lay and condemne
"d,
as unsuitabl"
e from every poi
"nt of view, the "
battleground he 
had not seen. 
 While disputes
 and intrigues w
ere going on abo
ut the future fi
"eld of
battle, "
and while we wer
e looking for th
e French—havin
g lost touch wit
h them—the Fr
ench stumbled up
on Nevérovski�
�s division and 
reached the wal
ls of Smolénsk.
  It was neces
sary to fight an
 unexpected batt
le at Smolénsk 
to save our lin
es of communicat
ion. The battle 
was fought and t
housands were ki
lled on both si
des.  Smoléns
k was abandoned 
contrary to the 
wishes of the Em
peror and of the
 whole people. 
But Smolénsk wa
s burned by its 
own inhabitants 
who had been mi
sled by their go
vernor. And thes
e ruined inhabit
"ants, setting
a"
n example to oth
"er Russians, wen"
t to Moscow thin

ir own losses b
ut kindling hatr
ed of the foe. N
apoleon advanced
 farther and we 
"
retired, thus a"
rriving at the v
ery result which
 caused his dest
ruction.    
  CHAPTER II 
 The day after 
his son had left
", Prince Nichola"
s sent for Princ
ess Mary to com
e to his study. 
  “Well? Are 
you satisfied no
w?” said he. �
��You’ve made 
me quarrel with 
my son! Satisfi
"ed, are you? Tha"
t’s all you wa
nted! Satisfied?
... It hurts me
", it hurts. I’"
m old and weak a
nd this is what 
you wanted. Well
" then,
gloat ov"
er it! Gloat ove
r it!”  Afte
r that Princess 
Mary did not see
 her father for 
a whole week. He
 was ill and di
d not leave his 
study.  Prince
ss Mary noticed 
to her surprise 
that during this
 illness the ol
d prince not onl
y excluded her f
"rom his room, bu"
t did not admit 
 Mademoiselle Bo
urienne either. 
Tíkhon alone at
tended him.  A
t the end of the
 week the prince
 reappeared and 
resumed his form
"er way
of life,"
 devoting himsel
f with special a
ctivity to build
ing operations 
and the arrangem
ent of the garde
ns and completel
y breaking off h
is relations wi
th Mademoiselle 
Bourienne. His l
ooks and cold to
ne to his daugh
ter seemed to sa
"y: “There, you"
 see? You plotte
"d against me, yo"
u lied to Princ
e Andrew about m
y relations with
 that Frenchwoma
n and made me q
"uarrel with him,"
 but you see I n
eed neither her 
nor you!”  P
rincess Mary spe
nt half of every
 day with little
" Nicholas, watch"
ing his lessons
", teaching him R"
ussian and music
" herself, and ta"
lking to Dessal
les; the rest of
 the day she spe
nt over her book
"s, with her old"
"
nurse, or with "
“God’s folk�
�� who sometimes
 came by the bac
k door to see h
er.  Of the wa
r Princess Mary 
thought as women
 do think about 
wars. She feare
d for her brothe
"r who was in it,"
 was horrified b
y and amazed at 
 the strange cru
elty that impels
 men to kill one
" another, but sh"
e did not under
stand the signif
icance of this w
"ar, which seemed"
 to her like all
 previous wars.
 She did not rea
lize the signifi
cance of this wa
"r, though
Dessa"
lles with whom s
he constantly co
nversed was pass
ionately interes
ted in its prog
ress and tried t
o explain his ow
n conception of 
"it to her,
and "
though the “Go
d’s folk” wh
o came to see he
"r reported, in t"
"heir own
way, t"
he rumors curren
t among the peop
le of an invasio
"n by Antichrist,"
 and though Jul
ie (now Princess
" Drubetskáya), "
who had resumed 
 correspondence 
"with her, wrote "
patriotic letter
s from Moscow. 
 “I write you
" in Russian, my "
"good friend,” "
wrote Julie in h
er Frenchified 
"Russian, “beca"
use I have a det
estation for all
" the French, and"
 the same for t
heir language wh
ich I cannot sup
port to hear spo
ken.... We in M
oscow are elated
 by enthusiasm f
or our adored Em
peror.  “My 
poor husband is 
enduring pains a
nd hunger in Jew
"ish taverns, but"
 the news which
 I have inspires
 me yet more.  
 “You heard pr
obably of the he
roic exploit of 
"Raévski, embrac"
ing his two son
s and saying: �
�I will perish w
ith them but we 
will not be shak
en!’ And trul
y though the ene
my was twice str
"onger than we, w"
e were unshakab
le. We pass the 
"time as we can, "
but in war as in
 war! The princ
esses Aline and 
Sophie sit whole
" days with me, a"
"nd we, unhappy
"
widows of live m
"en, make beautif"
ul conversations
 over our charpi
"e, only
you, my"
" friend, are mis"
sing...” and s
o on.  The chi
ef reason Prince
ss Mary did not 
realize the full
 significance of
 this war was t
hat the old prin
ce never spoke o
"f it, did not re"
"cognize
it, and"
 laughed at Dess
alles when he me
ntioned it at di
nner. The princ
e’s tone was s
o calm and confi
dent that Prince
ss Mary unhesit
atingly believed
 him.  All tha
t July the old p
rince was exceed
ingly active and
 even animated. 
 He planned anot
her garden and b
egan a new build
ing for the dome
stic serfs. The
 only thing that
 made Princess M
ary anxious abou
t him was that 
he slept very li
"ttle and, instea"
d of sleeping in
 his study as us
"ual,
changed hi"
s sleeping place
 every day. One 
day he would ord
er his camp bed
 to be set up in
 the glass galle
"ry, another day "
he remained on t
he couch or on 
the lounge chair
 in the drawing 
room and dozed t
here without un
"dressing, while�"
��instead of Mad
emoiselle Bourie
nne—a serf boy
 read to him. T
hen again he wou
ld spend a night
 in the dining r
oom.  On Augus
"t 1, a second le"
tter was receive
d from Prince An
drew. In his fi
rst letter which
 came soon after
 he had left hom
"e, Prince Andrew"
 had dutifully 
asked his father
’s forgiveness
 for what he had
 allowed himself
 to say and beg
ged to be restor
ed to his favor.
 To this letter 
the old prince 
had replied affe
"ctionately, and "
from that time h
ad kept the Fre
nchwoman at a di
stance. Prince A
ndrew’s second
" letter, written"
 near Vítebsk 
after the French
 had occupied th
"at town, gave a "
brief account of
 the whole camp
"aign, enclosed f"
or them a plan h
e had drawn and 
forecasts as to
 the further pro
gress of the war
. In this letter
 Prince Andrew 
pointed out to h
is father the da
nger of staying 
"at Bald Hills, s"
o near the thea
ter of war and o
n the army’s d
irect line of ma
"rch, and advised"
 him to move to
 Moscow.  At d
"inner that day, "
on Dessalles’ 
mentioning that 
the French were 
said to have al
ready entered V�
"�tebsk, the old "
prince remembere
d his son’s l
etter.  “The
re was a letter 
from Prince Andr
"ew today,” he "
said to Princess
 Mary—“Have
n’t you read i
"t?”

“No, "
"Father,” she r"
eplied in a frig
htened voice.  
 She could not h
ave read the let
ter as she did n
ot even know it 
had arrived.  
 “He writes ab
"out this war,”"
 said the prince
", with the ironi"
c smile that ha
d become habitua
l to him in spea
king of the pres
ent war.  “T
hat must be very
" interesting,”"
 said Dessalles.
 “Prince Andre
w is in a posit
ion to know...�
"�

“Oh, very"
 interesting!”
 said Mademoisel
le Bourienne.  
 “Go and get i
"t for me,” sai"
d the old prince
 to Mademoiselle
 Bourienne. “
You know—under
 the paperweight
 on the little t
able.”  Made
moiselle Bourien
ne jumped up eag
"erly.

“No, "
don’t!” he e
xclaimed with a 
frown. “You go
", Michael Iváno"
vich.”  Mich
ael Ivánovich r
ose and went to 
the study. But a
s soon as he had
 left the room 
"the old prince, "
looking uneasily
" round, threw do"
wn his napkin a
nd went himself.
  “They can�
��t do anything.
.. always make s
"ome muddle,” h"
e muttered.  W
hile he was away
" Princess Mary, "
"Dessalles, Madem"
oiselle Bourienn
"e, and
even lit"
tle Nicholas exc
hanged looks in 
silence. The old
 prince returned
 with quick ste
"ps, accompanied "
by Michael Iván
"ovich, bringing "
the letter and 
a plan. These he
 put down beside
 him—not letti
ng anyone read t
hem at dinner. 
  On moving to 
the drawing room
 he handed the l
etter to Princes
"s Mary and,
spr"
eading out befor
e him the plan o
f the new buildi
ng and fixing hi
"s
eyes upon it,"
 told her to rea
d the letter alo
ud. When she had
 done so Prince
ss Mary looked i
nquiringly at he
r father. He was
 examining the 
"plan, evidently "
engrossed in his
 own ideas.  �
��What do you th
"ink of it, Princ"
e?” Dessalles 
ventured to ask.
  “I? I?...�
�� said the prin
ce as if unpleas
"antly awakened, "
and not taking 
his eyes from th
e plan of the bu
ilding.  “Ve
ry possibly the 
theater of war w
ill move so near
 to us that...�
�  “Ha ha ha
! The theater of
 war!” said th
e prince. “I h
ave said and sti
ll say that the
 theater of war 
is Poland and th
e enemy will nev
er get beyond t
he Niemen.”  
 Dessalles looke
d in amazement a
"t the prince, wh"
o was talking of
 the Niemen whe
n the enemy was 
already at the D
"nieper, but Prin"
"cess Mary,
forg"
etting the geogr
aphical position
" of the Niemen, "
thought that wha
t her father wa
s saying was cor
rect.  “When
 the snow melts 
they’ll sink i
n the Polish swa
mps. Only they 
could fail to se
"e it,” the pri"
"nce continued, e"
vidently thinkin
g of the campai
gn of 1807 which
 seemed to him s
o recent. “Ben
nigsen should ha
ve advanced int
o Prussia sooner
", then things wo"
uld have taken a
 different turn
...”  “But
", Prince,” Des"
salles began tim
"idly, “the let"
ter mentions V�
�tebsk....”  
"
“Ah, the lett"
er? Yes...” re
plied the prince
 peevishly. “Y
es... yes...” 
 His face sudden
ly took on a mor
ose expression. 
He paused. “Ye
"s, he
writes th"
at the French we
re beaten at... 
at... what river
 is it?”  De
ssalles dropped 
his eyes.  “
The prince says 
nothing about th
"at,” he remark"
ed gently.  �
�Doesn’t he? B
ut I didn’t in
vent it myself.�
��  No one spo
ke for a long ti
me.  “Yes...
" yes... Well, Mi"
chael Ivánovich
",” he suddenly"
" went on, raisin"
g his head and 
pointing to the 
plan of the buil
"ding, “tell me"
 how you mean t
o alter it....�
�  Michael Iv�
�novich went up 
"to the plan, and"
 the prince afte
r speaking to h
im about the bui
lding looked ang
rily at Princess
 Mary and Dessal
les and went to
 his own room. 
 Princess Mary 
saw Dessalles’
 embarrassed and
 astonished look
 fixed on her f
"ather, noticed h"
"is silence, and "
was struck by th
e fact that her 
 father had forg
otten his son’
s letter on the 
drawing room tab
le; but she was
 not only afraid
 to speak of it 
and ask Dessalle
s the reason of 
his confusion a
"nd silence, but "
was afraid even 
to think about i
t.  In the eve
ning Michael Iv�
"�novich, sent by"
" the prince, cam"
e to Princess M
ary for Prince A
ndrew’s letter
 which had been 
forgotten in the
 drawing room. 
She gave it to h
"im and, unpleasa"
nt as it was to 
"her to do so,
v"
entured to ask h
im what her fath
er was doing.  
"
“Always busy,"
” replied Mich
ael Ivánovich w
ith a respectful
ly ironic smile
 which caused Pr
incess Mary to t
urn pale. “He�
��s worrying ver
y much about th
e new building. 
He has been read

t now”—Micha
el Ivánovich w
"ent on, lowering"
 his voice—“
now he’s at hi

"h

xpect.” (One o
f the prince’s
 favorite occupa
tions of late h
ad been the prep
aration of some 
papers he meant 
to leave at his 
death and which
 he called his �
��will.”)  �
��And Alpátych 
is being sent to

sked Princess Ma

“Oh, ye"

for some time.�

PTER III  When
 Michael Ivánov
ich returned to 
the study with t
"he letter, the o"
"ld
prince, with"
 spectacles on a
nd a shade over 
"his eyes, was si"
tting at his op
en bureau with s
"creened candles,"
 holding a paper
 in his outstret
"ched
hand, and "
in a somewhat dr
amatic attitude 
was reading his 
manuscript—his
 “Remarks” 
as he termed it�
��which was to b
e transmitted to
 the Emperor af
ter his death. 
 When Michael I
vánovich went i
n there were tea
rs in the prince
’s eyes evoke
d by the memory 
of the time when
 the paper he wa
s now reading ha
d been written.
 He took the let
ter from Michael
 Ivánovich’s 
"hand, put it
in"
" his pocket, fol"
ded up his paper
"s, and called in"
 Alpátych who h
ad long been wa
iting.  The pr
ince had a list 
of things to be 
bought in Smolé
"nsk and, walking"
 up and down th
e room past Alp�
�tych who stood 
"by the door, he "
gave his instru
ctions.  “Fi
"rst, notepaper�"
�do you hear? Ei
"ght quires, like"
" this sample,
g"
ilt-edged... it 
must be exactly 
like the sample.
" Varnish, sealin"
"g wax,
as in Mi"
chael Ivánovich
’s list.”  
 He paced up and
 down for a whil
e and glanced at
 his notes.  �
��Then hand to t
he governor in p
erson a letter a
bout the deed.�
"�

Next, bolts"
 for the doors o
f the new buildi
ng were wanted a
nd had to be of
 a special shape
 the prince had 
himself designed
", and a leather "
case had to be 
ordered to keep 
the “will” i
n.  The instru
ctions to Alpát
ych took over tw
o hours and stil
l the prince di
d not let him go
". He sat down, s"
ank into thought
", closed his eye"
"s, and
dozed of"
f. Alpátych mad
e a slight movem
"ent.

“Well,"
" go, go! If anyt"
hing more is wan
ted I’ll send 
after you.”  
 Alpátych went 
out. The prince 
again went to hi
"s bureau, glance"
"d into it,
fing"
"ered his papers,"
 closed the bure
"au again, and sa"
t down at the ta
ble to write to
 the governor. 
 It was already
 late when he ro
se after sealing
 the letter. He 
wished to sleep
", but he knew he"
 would not be ab
le to and that m
ost depressing 
thoughts came to
 him in bed. So 
he called Tíkho
n and went throu
gh the rooms wi
th him to show h
im where to set 
up the bed for t
hat night.  He
 went about look
ing at every cor
ner. Every place
 seemed unsatis
"factory, but wor"
st of all was hi
s customary couc
h in the study. 
 That couch was 
"dreadful to him,"
 probably becaus
e of the oppress
ive thoughts he
 had had when ly
ing there. It wa
s unsatisfactory
" everywhere,
bu"
t the corner beh
ind the piano in
 the sitting roo
m was better tha
n other places:
 he had never sl
ept there yet. 
 With the help 
of a footman Tí
khon brought in 
the bedstead and
 began putting 
it up.  “Tha
t’s not right!
 That’s not ri
ght!” cried th
"e prince, and hi"
mself pushed it
 a few inches fr
om the corner an
d then closer in
 again.  “We
"ll, at last I’"
"ve finished, now"
" I’ll rest,”"
 thought the pri
"nce, and
let T�"
�khon undress hi
m.  Frowning w
ith vexation at 
the effort neces
sary to divest h
imself of his c
oat and trousers
", the prince und"
"ressed, sat down"
 heavily on the 
"
bed, and appear"
ed to be meditat
ing as he looked
 contemptuously 
at his withered
 yellow legs. He
 was not meditat
"ing, but only de"
ferring the mom
ent of making th
e effort to lift
 those legs up a
nd turn over on 
the bed. “Ugh
", how hard it is"
"! Oh, that this "
toil might end a
nd you would re
lease me!” tho
ught he. Pressin
g his lips toget
her he made that
 effort for the
 twenty-thousand
th time and lay 
down. But hardly
 had he done so 
 before he felt 
the bed rocking 
backwards and fo
rwards beneath h
im as if it wer
e breathing heav
ily and jolting.
 This happened t
o him almost eve
ry night. He op
ened his eyes as
 they were closi
ng.  “No pea
"ce, damn them!�"
"� he muttered, a"
ngry he knew not
 with whom. “A
"h
yes, there wa"
s something else
" important, very"
" important, that"
 I was keeping 
till I should be
 in bed. The bol
"ts? No, I told h"
im about them. 
"No, it was somet"
"hing, something "
in the drawing r
oom. Princess Ma
ry talked some 
nonsense. Dessal
"les, that fool, "
said something. 
Something in my
 pocket—can’
t remember....�
"�

“Tíkhon,"
 what did we tal
k about at dinne
r?”  “Abou
t Prince Michael
...”  “Be 
"quiet, quiet!”"
 The prince slap
ped his hand on 
the table. “Ye
"s, I
know, Prin"
ce Andrew’s le
tter! Princess M
ary read it. Des
salles said som
ething about Ví
tebsk. Now I’l
l read it.”  
 He had the lett
er taken from hi
s pocket and the
 table—on whic
h stood a glass
 of lemonade and
 a spiral wax ca
ndle—moved clo
"se to the bed, a"
nd putting on h
is spectacles he
 began reading. 
Only now in the 
stillness of th
"e night, reading"
 it by the faint
 light under the
" green shade, di"
d he grasp its 
meaning for a mo
ment.  “The 
French at Víteb
"sk, in four days"
’ march they m
ay be at Smolén
sk; perhaps are
 already there! 
Tíkhon!” Tík
hon jumped up. �
"��No, no, I don�"
��t want anythi
ng!” he shoute
d.  He put the
 letter under th
e candlestick an
d closed his eye
s. And there ro
se before him th
e Danube at brig
ht noonday: reed
"s, the Russian
"
"camp, and himsel"
f a young genera
l without a wrin
kle on his ruddy
" face,

" and alert, ente"
ring Potëmkin�
�s gaily colored
" tent, and a
bu"
rning sense of j
ealousy of “th
e favorite” ag
itated him now a
s strongly as i
t had done then.
 He recalled all
 the words spoke
n at that first
 meeting with Po
tëmkin. And he 
saw before him a
" plump, rather
"
"sallow-faced, sh"
"ort, stout woman"
", the Empress Mo"
"ther, with her s"
mile and her wo
rds at her first
 gracious recept
"ion of him, and "
then that same 
face on the cata
"falque, and the "
encounter he had
 with Zúbov ove
r her coffin ab
out his right to
 kiss her hand. 
"

“Oh, quicke"

  CHAPTER IV  
"
Bald Hills, Pri"
nce Nicholas Bol
kónski’s esta
"te, lay forty mi"
les east from S
molénsk and two
 miles from the 
main road to Mos
cow.  The same
 evening that th
e prince gave hi
s instructions t
"o Alpátych,
De"
"ssalles, having "
asked to see Pri
"ncess Mary, told"
" her that, as th"
e prince was no
t very well and 
was taking no st
eps to secure hi
"s safety,
thoug"
h from Prince An
drew’s letter 
it was evident t
hat to remain at
 Bald Hills mig
"ht be dangerous,"
 he respectfully
 advised her to 
send a letter b
y Alpátych to t
he Provincial Go
vernor at Smolé
"nsk, asking him "
to let her know
 the state of af
fairs and the ex
tent of the dang
er to which Bal
d Hills was expo
sed. Dessalles w
rote this letter
 to the Governor
 for Princess M
"ary, she signed "
"it, and it was g"
iven to Alpátyc
h with instruct
ions to hand it 
to the Governor 
and to come back
 as quickly as 
possible if ther
e was danger.  
 Having received
 all his orders 
"Alpátych, weari"
ng a white beave
r hat—a prese
nt from the prin
ce—and carryin
g a stick as the
" prince did, wen"
t out accompani
ed by his family
. Three well-fed
 roans stood rea
dy harnessed to 
 a small conveya
nce with a leath
er hood.  The 
larger bell was 
muffled and the 
little bells on 
the harness stuf
fed with paper.
 The prince allo
wed no one at Ba
ld Hills to driv
e with ringing 
bells; but on a 
long journey Alp
átych liked to 
have them. His 
satellites—the
" senior clerk, a"
 countinghouse c
"lerk, a scullery"
" maid,
a cook, "
"two old women, a"
" little pageboy,"
" the coachman, a"
nd various dome
stic serfs—wer
e seeing him off
.  His daughte
r placed chintz-
covered down cus
hions for him to
 sit on and beh
ind his back. Hi
s old sister-in-
law popped in a 
"small bundle, an"
d one of the co
achmen helped hi
m into the vehic
le.  “There!
 There! Women’
"s fuss! Women, w"
omen!” said Al
"pátych, puffing"
 and speaking r
apidly just as t
"he prince did, a"
nd he climbed in
to the trap.  
After giving the
 clerk orders ab
out the work to 
"be done, Alpáty"
"ch, not
trying "
to imitate the p
"rince now, lifte"
d the hat from h
is bald head and
 crossed himsel
f three times. 
 “If there is
 anything... com
"e back, Yákov A"
lpátych! For Ch
rist’s sake t
hink of us!” c
"ried his wife, r"
eferring to the 
rumors of war an
d the enemy.  
"
“Women, women"
! Women’s fuss
!” muttered Al
pátych to himse
lf and started 
"on his journey, "
looking round at
 the fields of y
ellow rye and th
"e
still-green, "
thickly growing 
"oats, and at oth"
er quite black f
ields just bein
g plowed a secon
d time.  As he
 went along he l
ooked with pleas
ure at the year�
��s splendid cro
"p
of corn, scru"
tinized the stri
ps of ryefield w
hich here and th
ere were alread
"y being reaped, "
made his calcula
tions as to the 
sowing and the 
"harvest, and ask"
ed himself wheth
er he had not fo
rgotten any of t
he prince’s o
rders.  Having
 baited the hors
es twice on the 
"way, he arrived "
at the town towa
rd evening on t
he fourth of Aug
ust.  Alpátyc
h kept meeting a
nd overtaking ba
ggage trains and
 troops on the 
road. As he appr
oached Smolénsk
 he heard the so
unds of distant 
"firing,
but the"
se did not impre
ss him. What str
uck him most was
 the sight of a 
 splendid field 
of oats in which
 a camp had been
 pitched and whi
ch was being mo
wn down by the s
"oldiers, evident"
ly for fodder. T
his fact impres
"sed Alpátych, b"
ut in thinking a
bout his own bus
iness he soon f
orgot it.  All
 the interests o
f his life for m
ore than thirty 
years had been 
bounded by the w
ill of the princ
"e, and he never "
went beyond that
 limit. Everyth
ing not connecte
d with the execu
tion of the prin
ce’s orders di
d not interest 
and did not even
 exist for Alpá
tych.  On reac
hing Smolénsk o
n the evening of
 the fourth of A
ugust he put up 
 in the Gáchina
 suburb across t
"he Dnieper, at t"
he inn kept by F
"erapóntov,
whe"
re he had been i
n the habit of p
utting up for th
e last thirty ye
ars. Some thirt
y years ago Fera
"póntov, by Alp�"
�tych’s advice
", had bought a
"
wood from the pr
"ince, had begun "
"to trade, and no"
"w had a house, a"
"n
inn, and a co"
rn dealer’s sh
op in that provi
nce. He was a st
"out, dark,
red-"
faced peasant in
" the forties, wi"
"th thick lips, a"
 broad knob of a
"
nose, similar "
knobs over his b
lack frowning br
"ows, and a round"
 belly.  Weari
ng a waistcoat o
ver his cotton s
"hirt, Ferapónto"
v was standing 
before his shop 
which opened ont
o the street. On
 seeing Alpátyc
h he went up to
 him.  “You�
"��re welcome, Y�"
�kov Alpátych. 
Folks are leavin
"g the town, but "
you have come t
"o it,” said he"
.  “Why are 
they leaving the
 town?” asked 
Alpátych.  �
�That’s what I
 say. Folks are 
foolish! Always 
afraid of the Fr
ench.”  “W
"omen’s fuss, w"
omen’s fuss!�
� said Alpátych
.  “Just wha
"t I think, Yáko"
v Alpátych. Wha
t I say is: orde
rs have been gi
ven not to let t
"hem in, so that "
must be right. A
nd the peasants 
are asking thre
e rubles for car
ting—it isn’
t Christian!” 
  Yákov Alpát
ych heard withou
t heeding. He as
ked for a samova
r and for hay f
"or his horses, a"
nd when he had h
ad his tea he we
nt to bed.  Al
l night long tro
ops were moving 
past the inn. Ne
xt morning Alpá
tych donned a j
acket he wore on
ly in town and w
ent out on busin
ess. It was a s
unny morning and
 by eight o’cl
ock it was alrea
dy hot. “A goo
d day for harve
"sting,” though"
t Alpátych.  
From beyond the 
town firing had 
been heard since
 early morning. 
At eight o’cl
ock the booming 
of cannon was ad
ded to the sound
 of musketry. Ma
ny people were 
hurrying through
 the streets and
 there were many
" soldiers,
but "
cabs were still 
"driving about, t"
radesmen stood a
"t their shops, a"
nd service was 
being held in th
e churches as us
ual. Alpátych w
ent to the shop
"s, to government"
" offices, to the"
" post office, an"
d to the Governo
r’s. In the o
ffices and shops
 and at the post
 office everyone
 was talking ab
out the army and
 about the enemy
 who was already
 attacking the t
"own,
everybody "
was asking what 
"should be done, "
and all were try
ing to calm one
 another.  In 
front of the Gov
ernor’s house 
Alpátych found 
a large number o
"f
people, Cossa"
"cks, and a trave"
ling carriage of
 the Governor’
s. At the porch
 he met two of t
he landed gentry
", one of whom he"
" knew. This man,"
 an ex-captain 
"of police, was s"
aying angrily: 
 “It’s no j
"oke, you know! I"
t’s all very w
ell if you’re 
single. ‘One m
an though undon
"e is but one,’"
 as the proverb 
"says, but with t"
hirteen in your
 family and all 
the property... 
They’ve brough
t us to utter ru
in! What sort o
f governors are 
they to do that?
 They ought to b
e hanged—the 
brigands!...” 
"

“Oh come, t"
hat’s enough!�
�� said the othe
r.  “What do
 I care? Let him
 hear! We’re n
"ot dogs,” said"
 the ex-captain 
"of
police, and "
looking round he
 noticed Alpáty
"ch.

“Oh, Y�"
�kov Alpátych! 
What have you co
me for?”  �
�To see the Gove
rnor by his exce
llency’s order
",” answered Al"
"pátych,
liftin"
g his head and p
roudly thrusting
 his hand into t
he bosom of his 
 coat as he alwa
ys did when he m
entioned the pri
nce.... “He ha
s ordered me to
 inquire into th
e position of af
"fairs,” he add"
"ed.

“Yes, g"
o and find out!�
�� shouted the a
ngry gentleman. 
“They’ve bro
ught things to 
such a pass that
 there are no ca
rts or anything!
... There it is
" again, do you h"
"ear?” said he,"
 pointing in the
 direction whenc
e came the soun
ds of firing.  
 “They’ve br
ought us all to 
ruin... the brig
ands!” he repe
"ated, and
desce"
nded the porch s
teps.  Alpáty
ch swayed his he
ad and went upst
airs. In the wai
ting room were 
"tradesmen, women"
", and officials,"
 looking silentl
y at one another
. The door of t
he Governor’s 
room opened and 
they all rose an
d moved forward.
 An official ra
"n out, said some"
 words to a merc
"hant, called a s"
tout official w
ith a cross hang
ing on his neck 
"to follow him, a"
nd vanished aga
"in, evidently wi"
shing to avoid t
he inquiring loo
ks and questions
 addressed to h
im. Alpátych mo
ved forward and 
next time the of
ficial came out
" addressed him, "
one hand placed 
in the breast of
 his buttoned co
"at,
and handed "
him two letters.
  “To his Ho
"nor Baron Asch, "
from General-in-
Chief Prince Bol
"kónski,” he
"
announced with s
uch solemnity an
d significance t
hat the official
 turned to him 
and took the let
ters.  A few m
inutes later the
 Governor receiv
ed Alpátych and
 hurriedly said 
to him:  “I
nform the prince
 and princess th
at I knew nothin
g: I acted on th
e highest instr
uctions—here..
.” and he hand
ed a paper to Al
pátych. “Stil
"l,
as the princ"
e is unwell my a
dvice is that th
ey should go to 
Moscow. I am ju
st starting myse
lf. Inform them.
..”  But the
 Governor did no
t finish: a dust
y perspiring off
icer ran into th
e room and bega
n to say somethi
ng in French. Th
e Governor’s f
ace expressed t
"error.

“Go,"
"” he said, nod"
ding his head to
" Alpátych, and "
began questionin
g the officer. 
"

Eager, fright"
"ened, helpless g"
lances were turn
ed on Alpátych 
when he came ou
t of the Governo
r’s room. Invo
luntarily listen
ing now to the f
"iring,
which ha"
d drawn nearer a
nd was increasin
"g in strength, A"
lpátych hurried
 to his inn. Th
e paper handed t
o him by the Gov
ernor said this:
  “I assure 
you that the tow
n of Smolénsk i
s not in the sli
ghtest danger a
s yet and it is 
unlikely that it
 will be threate
ned with any. I 
from the one si
de and Prince Ba
gratión from th
e other are marc
hing to unite o

 (Instructions 
from Barclay de 
Tolly to Baron A

"
 People were anx
iously roaming a
bout the streets
.  Carts piled
 high with house
"hold utensils, c"
"hairs, and cupbo"
ards kept emerg
ing from the gat
es of the yards 
and moving along
 the streets. L
oaded carts stoo
d at the house n
ext to Ferapónt
ov’s and women
 were wailing a
nd lamenting as 
they said good-b
y. A small watch
dog ran round b
arking in front 
of the harnessed
 horses.  Alp�
�tych entered th
e innyard at a q
uicker pace than
 usual and went 
 straight to the
 shed where his 
horses and trap 
were. The coachm
an was asleep. 
"He woke him up, "
told him to harn
"ess, and went in"
to the passage. 
 From the host�
�s room came the
 sounds of a chi
"ld crying, the d"
espairing sobs 
"of a woman, and "
the hoarse angry
 shouting of Fer
apóntov. The co
ok began runnin
g hither and thi
ther in the pass
age like a frigh
"tened hen,
just"
 as Alpátych en
tered.  “He�
��s done her to 
death. Killed th
e mistress!... B
eat her... dragg
ed her about so
!...”  “Wh
at for?” asked
 Alpátych.  �
��She kept beggi
ng to go away. S
he’s a woman! 
"‘Take me away,"
"’ says she,
�"
��don’t let me
 perish with my 
little children!
" Folks,’ she s"
"ays, ‘are all"
"
gone, so why,�"
"� she says, ‘d"
on’t we go?’
 And he began be
ating and pullin
g her about so!
”  At these 
words Alpátych 
nodded as if in 
"approval, and no"
t wishing to he
ar more went to 
the door of the 
room opposite th
"e innkeeper’s,"
 where he had l
eft his purchase
s.  “You bru
"te, you murderer"
!” screamed a 
"thin, pale woman"
" who, with a bab"
y in her arms a
nd her kerchief 
torn from her he
"ad, burst throug"
h the door at t
hat moment and d
own the steps in
to the yard.  
Ferapóntov came
" out after her, "
but on seeing Al
pátych adjusted
" his
waistcoat,"
 smoothed his ha
"ir, yawned, and "
followed Alpáty
ch into the opp
osite room.  �
��Going already?
” said he.  
"Alpátych, witho"
ut answering or 
looking at his h
"ost, sorted his "
packages and as
ked how much he 
owed.  “We�
�ll reckon up! W
"ell, have you be"
en to the Govern
or’s?” asked
 Ferapóntov. �
��What has been 
decided?”  A
lpátych replied
 that the Govern
or had not told 
him anything def
inite.  “Wit
"h our business, "
how can we get a
way?” said Fer
apóntov. “We�
��d have to pay
 seven rubles a 
cartload to Doro
gobúzh and I te
ll them they’r
e not Christian
s to ask it! Sel
"ivánov, now, di"
d a good stroke 
last Thursday�
�sold flour to t
he army at nine 
rubles a sack. W
ill you have so
me tea?” he ad
ded.  While th
e horses were be
ing harnessed Al
pátych and Fera
póntov over the
ir tea talked o
f the price of c
"orn, the crops, "
and the good wea
ther for harves
ting.  “Well
", it seems to be"
 getting quieter
",” remarked Fe"
"rapóntov, finis"
hing his third 
cup of tea and g
etting up. “Ou
rs must have got
 the best of it.
 The orders wer
e not to let the
m in. So we’re
" in force, it se"
ems.... They sa
y the other day 
Matthew Iványch
 Plátov drove t
hem into the riv
er Márina and 
drowned some eig
hteen thousand i
n one day.”  
 Alpátych colle
cted his parcels
", handed them to"
 the coachman wh
"o had come
in, "
and settled up w
ith the innkeepe
r. The noise of 
"wheels, hoofs, a"
nd bells was he
ard from the gat
eway as a little
 trap passed out
.  It was by n
ow late in the a
fternoon. Half t
he street was in
" shadow, the
ot"
her half brightl
y lit by the sun
. Alpátych look
ed out of the wi
ndow and went t
o the door. Sudd
enly the strange
 sound of a far-
off whistling a
nd thud was hear
"d, followed by a"
 boom of cannon 
blending into a 
dull roar that 
set the windows 
rattling.  He 
went out into th
e street: two me
n were running p
ast toward the 
bridge. From dif
ferent sides cam
e whistling soun
ds and the thud 
of cannon balls
 and bursting sh
ells falling on 
the town. But th
ese sounds were
 hardly heard in
 comparison with
 the noise of th
e firing outside
 the town and a
ttracted little 
attention from t
he inhabitants. 
The town was be
ing bombarded by
 a hundred and t
hirty guns which
 Napoleon had or
dered up after 
four o’clock. 
The people did n
ot at once reali
ze the meaning o
f this bombardm
ent.  At first
 the noise of th
e falling bombs 
and shells only 
aroused curiosi
ty. Ferapóntov�
"��s wife, who ti"
ll then had not 
ceased wailing u
"nder
the shed, "
became quiet and
 with the baby i
n her arms went 
"to the gate,
li"
stening to the s
ounds and lookin
g in silence at 
the people.  T
he cook and a sh
op assistant cam
e to the gate. W
ith lively curio
sity everyone t
ried to get a gl
impse of the pro
jectiles as they
 flew over thei
r heads. Several
 people came rou
nd the corner ta
lking eagerly. 
 “What force!
” remarked one
. “Knocked the
 roof and ceilin
g all to splint
ers!”  “Ro
uted up the eart
"h like a pig,”"
 said another. 
 “That’s gr
"and, it bucks on"
e up!” laughed
 the first. “L
ucky you jumped 
"
aside, or it wo"
uld have wiped y
ou out!”  Ot
hers joined thos
e men and stoppe
d and told how c
annon balls had 
fallen on a hou
se close to them
. Meanwhile stil
l more projectil
"es, now with
th"
e swift sinister
 whistle of a ca
"nnon ball, now w"
ith the agreeabl
e intermittent 
whistle of a she
"ll, flew over pe"
ople’s heads i
"ncessantly,
but"
 not one fell cl
"ose by, they all"
 flew over. Alp�
�tych was gettin
g into his trap
. The innkeeper 
stood at the gat
e.  “What ar
e you staring at
?” he shouted 
"to the cook, who"
 in her red skir
"t,
with sleeves"
" rolled up, swin"
ging her bare el
"bows, had steppe"
d to the corner
 to listen to wh
at was being sai
d.  “What ma
rvels!” she ex
"claimed, but hea"
ring her master�
��s voice she tu
"rned
back, pull"
ing down her tuc
ked-up skirt.  
 Once more somet
"hing whistled, b"
ut this time qui
"te close, swoopi"
ng downwards li
ke a little bird
; a flame flashe
d in the middle 
"of the
street, "
something explod
"ed, and the stre"
et was shrouded 
in smoke.  “
"Scoundrel, what "
are you doing?�
� shouted the in
"nkeeper, rushing"
 to the cook. 
 At that moment
 the pitiful wai
ling of women wa
s heard from dif
"ferent
sides, t"
he frightened ba
"by began to cry,"
 and people crow
ded silently wi
th pale faces ro
und the cook. Th
e loudest sound 
in that crowd wa
s her wailing. 
  “Oh-h-h! De
"ar souls, dear k"
ind souls! Don�
�t let me die! M
y good souls!..
.”  Five min
utes later no on
e remained in th
e street. The co
"ok, with her
th"
igh broken by a 
"shell splinter, "
had been carried
 into the kitche
"n.
Alpátych, h"
"is coachman, Fer"
apóntov’s wif

The roar of guns

" of projectiles,"
 and the piteous
 moaning of the 
"cook, which
ros"
e above the othe
"r sounds, did no"
t cease for a mo
ment. The mistre
ss rocked and h
ushed her baby a
nd when anyone c
ame into the cel
lar asked in a 
pathetic whisper
 what had become
 of her husband 
who had remained
 in the street.
 A shopman who e
ntered told her 
that her husband
 had gone with 
others to the ca
"thedral, whence "
they were fetchi
ng the wonder-w
orking icon of S
molénsk.  Tow
ard dusk the can
nonade began to 
subside. Alpáty
ch left the cell
ar and stopped 
in the doorway. 
The evening sky 
that had been so
 clear was clou
"ded with smoke, "
"through which, h"
"igh up, the sick"
le of the new mo
on shone strang
ely. Now that th
e terrible din o
f the guns had c
eased a hush se
emed to reign ov
"er the town, bro"
ken only by the 
rustle of footst
"eps,
the moanin"
"g, the distant c"
"ries, and the cr"
ackle of fires w
hich seemed wid
espread everywhe
re. The cook’s
 moans had now s
ubsided. On two 
sides black cur
ling clouds of s
moke rose and sp
read from the fi
res. Through th
e streets soldie
rs in various un
iforms walked or
 ran confusedly 
in different di
rections like an
ts from a ruined
 ant-hill. Sever
al of them ran 
into Ferapóntov
’s yard before
 Alpátych’s e
yes. Alpátych w
ent out to the 
gate. A retreati
"ng regiment, thr"
onging and hurry
"ing, blocked the"
 street.  Not
"icing him, an of"
ficer said: “T
he town is being
 abandoned. Get 
"away,
get away!"
"” and then, tu"
rning to the sol
"diers, shouted:"
  “I’ll tea
ch you to run in
to the yards!”
  Alpátych we
nt back to the h
"ouse, called the"
" coachman, and t"
old him to set 
off. Ferapóntov
’s whole house
hold came out to
"o, following Alp"
átych and the 
coachman. The wo
"men, who had bee"
n silent till th
"en, suddenly
be"
gan to wail as t
hey looked at th
e fires—the sm
oke and even the
 flames of whic
h could be seen 
in the failing t
wilight—and as
 if in reply the
 same kind of l
amentation was h
eard from other 
parts of the str
eet. Inside the
 shed Alpátych 
and the coachman
 arranged the ta
ngled reins and 
 traces of their
 horses with tre
mbling hands.  
 As Alpátych wa
s driving out of
 the gate he saw
 some ten soldie
rs in Ferapónt
ov’s open shop
", talking loudly"
 and filling the
ir bags and kna
psacks with flou
r and sunflower 
seeds. Just then
 Ferapóntov ret
urned and enter
ed his shop. On 
seeing the soldi
ers he was about
 to shout at th
"em, but suddenly"
" stopped and, cl"
utching at his h
"air, burst into "
sobs and laught
er:  “Loot e
"verything, lads!"
 Don’t let tho
se devils get it
"!” he cried, t"
aking some bags
 of flour himsel
f and throwing t
hem into the str
eet.  Some of 
the soldiers wer
e frightened and
" ran away, other"
s went on filli
ng their bags. O
n seeing Alpáty
"ch, Ferapóntov "
turned to him: 
 “Russia is d
one for!” he c
ried. “Alpáty
"ch, I’ll set t"
he place on fire
 myself. We’r
e done for!...�
� and Ferapónto
v ran into the y
ard.  Soldiers
 were passing in
 a constant stre
am along the str
eet blocking it
" completely, so "
that Alpátych c
ould not pass ou
t and had to wai
t. Ferapóntov�
��s wife and chi
ldren were also 
sitting in a car
t waiting till 
it was possible 
to drive out.  
 Night had come.
 There were star
s in the sky and
 the new moon sh
one out amid th
e smoke that scr
eened it. On the
 sloping descent
 to the Dnieper 
 Alpátych’s c
art and that of 
the innkeeper’
"s wife, which we"
re slowly movin
g amid the rows 
of soldiers and 
of other vehicle
"s, had to stop."
 In a side stree
t near the cross
roads where the 
vehicles had sto
"pped, a
house a"
nd some shops we
re on fire. This
 fire was alread
y burning itself
 out. The flame
s now died down 
and were lost in
 the black smoke
", now
suddenly "
flared up again 
"brightly, lighti"
ng up with stran
ge distinctness 
 the faces of th
e people crowdin
g at the crossro
ads. Black figur
es flitted abou
t before the fir
"e, and through t"
he incessant cra
ckling of the f
lames talking an
d shouting could
 be heard. Seein
g that his trap 
 would not be ab
le to move on fo
"r some time, Alp"
átych got down 
and turned into
 the side street
 to look at the 
fire. Soldiers w
ere continually 
 rushing backwar
ds and forwards 
"near it, and he "
saw two of them 
and a man in a 
frieze coat drag
ging burning bea
ms into another 
yard across the 
"
street, while o"
thers carried bu
ndles of hay.  
 Alpátych went 
up to a large cr
owd standing bef
ore a high barn 
which was blazi
ng briskly. The 
walls were all o
n fire and the b
ack wall had fal
"len
in, the woo"
den roof was col
"lapsing, and the"
 rafters were al
ight. The crowd
 was evidently w
atching for the 
"roof to fall in,"
 and Alpátych 
watched for it t
oo.  “Alpát
ych!” a famili
ar voice suddenl
y hailed the old
 man.  “Merc
y on us! Your ex
cellency!” ans
"wered Alpátych,"
 immediately re
cognizing the vo
ice of his young
 prince.  Prin
ce Andrew in his
" riding cloak, m"
ounted on a blac
"k horse, was loo"
king at Alpáty
ch from the back
 of the crowd. 
 “Why are you
 here?” he ask
ed.  “Your..
. your excellenc
"y,” stammered "
Alpátych and br
oke into sobs. �
��Are we really
 lost? Master!..
.”  “Why a
re you here?” 
Prince Andrew re
peated.  At th
at moment the fl
ames flared up a
nd showed his yo
ung master’s p
ale worn face. 
Alpátych told h
ow he had been s
ent there and ho
w difficult it 
was to get away.
  “Are we re
"ally quite lost,"
 your excellency
?” he asked ag
ain.  Prince A
ndrew without re
plying took out 
a notebook and r
aising his knee 
 began writing i
n pencil on a pa
ge he tore out. 
He wrote to his 
sister:  “Sm
olénsk is being
 abandoned. Bald
 Hills will be o
ccupied by the e
nemy within a w
eek. Set off imm
ediately for Mos
cow. Let me know
 at once when y
ou will start. S
end by special m
essenger to Usvy

ng written this 
and given the pa

r departure of t
"he prince, the p"
"rincess, his son"

"�s tutor, and ho"
w and where to l
et him know imme

 he had had time
 to finish givin
g these instruct

 staff followed
 by a suite gall
oped up to him. 
  “You are a 
colonel?” shou
ted the chief of
 staff with a Ge
"rman accent,
in"
 a voice familia
r to Prince Andr
ew. “Houses ar
e set on fire in
 your presence 
and you stand by

 mean? You will 
answer for it!�
"�� shouted Berg,"
 who was now ass
istant to the ch
ief of staff of 
the commander o
f the left flank
 of the infantry
 of the first ar
"my, a place,
as"
" Berg said, “v"
ery agreeable an
d well en évide

e Andrew looked 
at him and witho
ut replying went
 on speaking to 
 Alpátych.  �
��So tell them t
hat I shall awai
t a reply till t
"he tenth, and if"
 by the tenth I
 don’t receive
 news that they 
have all got awa

o throw up ever
ything and come 
myself to Bald H
ills.”  “P
"rince,” said B"
"erg, recognizing"
" Prince Andrew, "
“I only spoke 
because I have 
"to obey orders, "
because I always
 do obey exactly
.... You must p
"lease excuse me,"
” he went on a
pologetically. 
 Something crac
ked in the flame
s. The fire died
 down for a mome
nt and wreaths 
of black smoke r
olled from under
 the roof. There
 was another te
rrible crash and
 something huge 
collapsed.  �
�Ou-rou-rou!” 
yelled the crowd
", echoing the cr"
ash of the colla
psing roof of t
"he barn, the bur"
ning grain in wh
ich diffused a c
akelike aroma al
l around. The f
lames flared up 
"again, lighting "
"the animated, de"
"lighted,
exhaus"
ted faces of the
 spectators.  
The man in the f
rieze coat raise
d his arms and s
houted:  “It
"’s fine, lads!"
 Now it’s ragi
ng... It’s fin
e!”  “That
’s the owner h
"imself,” cried"
 several voices.
  “Well then
",” continued P"
rince Andrew to 
"Alpátych, “re"
port to them as 
I have told you
”; and not rep
lying a word to 
Berg who was now
 mute beside hi

s horse and rode
 down the side s
treet.     
 CHAPTER V  F
rom Smolénsk th
e troops continu
"ed to retreat, f"
ollowed by the e
nemy. On the te
nth of August th
e regiment Princ
e Andrew command
ed was marching 
 along the highr
oad past the ave
nue leading to B
ald Hills. Heat 
and drought had
 continued for m
ore than three w
eeks. Each day f
leecy clouds fl
oated across the
 sky and occasio
nally veiled the
" sun, but toward"
 evening the sk
y cleared again 
and the sun set 
in reddish-brown
 mist. Heavy ni
ght dews alone r
efreshed the ear
th. The unreaped
 corn was scorc
hed and shed its
 grain. The mars
hes dried up. Th
e cattle lowed f
"rom
hunger, fin"
ding no food on 
the sun-parched 
meadows. Only at
 night and in t
he forests while
 the dew lasted 
was there any fr
eshness. But on 
"the
road, the h"
ighroad along wh
ich the troops m
"arched, there wa"
s no such fresh
ness even at nig
ht or when the r
oad passed throu
gh the forest; t
he dew was impe
rceptible on the
 sandy dust chur
ned up more than
 six inches dee
p. As soon as da
y dawned the mar
ch began. The ar
tillery and bagg
age wagons move
d noiselessly th
rough the deep d
ust that rose to
 the very hubs 
"of the wheels, a"
nd the infantry 
sank ankle-deep 
"in that soft,
c"
"hoking, hot dust"
 that never cool
ed even at night
. Some of this d
ust was kneaded
 by the feet and
" wheels, while t"
he rest rose and
 hung like a cl
oud over the tro
"ops, settling in"
" eyes, ears, hai"
"r, and nostrils,"
 and worst of a
ll in the lungs 
of the men and b
easts as they mo
ved along that 
road. The higher
 the sun rose th
e higher rose th
at cloud of dust
", and
through t"
he screen of its
 hot fine partic
les one could lo
ok with naked e
"ye at the sun, w"
hich showed like
 a huge crimson 
ball in the uncl
ouded sky. Ther
"e was no wind, a"
nd the men choke
d in that motion
less atmosphere
. They marched w
ith handkerchief
s tied over thei
r noses and mou
ths. When they p
assed through a 
village they all
 rushed to the w
ells and fought
 for the water a
nd drank it down
 to the mud.  
Prince Andrew wa
s in command of 
"a regiment, and "
the management o
f that regiment
", the welfare of"
 the men and the
 necessity of re
ceiving and giv
"ing orders, engr"
ossed him. The b
urning of Smolé
nsk and its aba
ndonment made an
 epoch in his li
fe. A novel feel
ing of anger aga
inst the foe ma
de him forget hi
s own sorrow. He
 was entirely de
voted to the af
fairs of his reg
iment and was co
nsiderate and ki
nd to his men an
d officers. In 
the regiment the
y called him “
"our prince,” w"
ere proud of hi
m and loved him.
 But he was kind
 and gentle only
 to those of his
"
regiment, to T"
imókhin and the
 like—people q
"uite new to him,"
 belonging to a
 different world
 and who could n
ot know and unde
rstand his past.
 As soon as he 
came across a fo
rmer acquaintanc
e or anyone from
" the
staff, he "
bristled up imme
diately and grew
" spiteful, ironi"
"cal, and
contem"
ptuous. Everythi
ng that reminded
 him of his past
 was repugnant t
"o
him, and so i"
n his relations 
with that former
 circle he confi
ned himself to 
trying to do his
 duty and not to
 be unfair.  I
n truth everythi
ng presented its
elf in a dark an
d gloomy light t
o Prince Andrew
", especially aft"
er the abandonme
nt of Smolénsk 
on the sixth of
 August (he cons
idered that it c
ould and should 
have been defend
ed) and after h
is sick father h
ad had to flee t
"o Moscow, abando"
ning to pillage
 his dearly belo
ved Bald Hills w
hich he had buil
t and peopled. 
But despite this
", thanks to his "
"regiment, Prince"
 Andrew had some
thing to think 
about entirely a
part from genera
l questions. Two
 days previously
 he had receive
d news that his 
"father, son, and"
 sister had left
 for Moscow; an
d though there w
as nothing for h
im to do at Bald
" Hills, Prince
"
Andrew with a ch
aracteristic des
ire to foment hi
s own grief deci
ded that he mus
t ride there.  
 He ordered his 
horse to be sadd
"led and, leaving"
 his regiment on
" the
march, rod"
e to his father�
��s estate where
 he had been bor
n and spent his 
 childhood. Ridi
ng past the pond
 where there use
d always to be d
ozens of women 
chattering as th
ey rinsed their 
linen or beat it
 with wooden be
"etles, Prince An"
drew noticed tha
t there was not 
a soul about and
 that the littl
"e washing wharf,"
 torn from its p
lace and half su
"bmerged, was
fl"
oating on its si
de in the middle
 of the pond. He
 rode to the kee
per’s lodge. 
No one was at th
e stone entrance
 gates of the dr
ive and the door
 stood open. Gr
ass had already 
begun to grow on
 the garden path
"s, and
horses a"
nd calves were s
traying in the E
nglish park. Pri
nce Andrew rode 
 up to the hotho
use; some of the
 glass panes wer
"e broken, and of"
 the trees in t
ubs some were ov
erturned and oth
ers dried up. He
 called for Tar
ás the gardener
", but no one rep"
lied. Having gon
e round the corn
er of the hotho
use to the ornam
"ental garden, he"
 saw that the ca
rved garden fen
ce was broken an
d branches of th
e plum trees had
 been torn off w
ith the fruit. 
An old peasant w
hom Prince Andre
w in his childho
od had often se
en at the gate w
as sitting on a 
green garden sea
"t, plaiting a ba"
st shoe.  He 
was deaf and did
 not hear Prince
 Andrew ride up.
 He was sitting 
on the seat the
 old prince used
 to like to sit 
"on, and beside h"
im strips of ba
st were hanging 
on the broken an
d withered branc
h of a magnolia.
  Prince Andre
w rode up to the
 house. Several 
limes in the old
 garden had bee
n cut down and a
 piebald mare an
d her foal were 
wandering in fro
nt of the house
 among the roseb
ushes. The shutt
ers were all clo
"sed, except at
"
one window which
 was open. A lit
"tle serf boy, se"
eing Prince Andr
"ew, ran
into th"
e house. Alpáty
"ch, having sent "
"his family away,"
 was alone at B
ald Hills and wa
s sitting indoor
s reading the Li
ves of the Saint
s. On hearing t
hat Prince Andre
"w had come, he w"
ent out with his
 spectacles on 
"his nose, button"
"ing his coat, an"
"d, hastily stepp"
"ing up, without "
a word began we
eping and kissin
g Prince Andrew�
��s knee.  The
"n, vexed at his "
"own weakness, he"
 turned away and
 began to report
 on the positio
n of affairs. Ev
erything preciou
s and valuable h
ad been removed
 to Boguchárovo
. Seventy quarte
rs of grain had 
also been carted
 away. The hay 
and the spring c
"orn, of which Al"
pátych said the
re had been a r
emarkable crop t
"hat year, had be"
en commandeered 
by the troops an
d mown down whi
le still green. 
The peasants wer
e ruined; some o
f them too had 
gone to Boguchá
"rovo, only a few"
 remained.  Wi
thout waiting to
" hear him out, P"
rince Andrew ask
ed:  “When d
id my father and
 sister leave?�
� meaning when d
id they leave fo
r Moscow.  Al
"pátych, underst"
anding the quest
ion to refer to 
their departure 
for Boguchárov
"o, replied that "
they had left on
 the seventh and
 again went int
o details concer
ning the estate 
"management, aski"
ng for instructi
ons.  “Am I 
to let the troop
"s have the oats,"
 and to take a r
eceipt for them?
 We have still 
six hundred quar
"ters left,” he"
 inquired.  �
�What am I to sa
y to him?” tho
ught Prince Andr
"ew, looking down"
 on the old man
’s bald head s
hining in the su
n and seeing by 
the expression o
n his face that
 the old man him
self understood 
how untimely suc
h questions wer
e and only asked
 them to allay h
is grief.  “
"Yes, let them ha"
"ve it,” replie"
d Prince Andrew.
  “If you no
ticed some disor
der in the garde
"n,” said Alpá"
"tych, “it was"
 impossible to p
revent it. Three
 regiments have 
been here and sp
"ent
the night, "
dragoons mostly.
 I took down the
 name and rank o
f their command
"ing officer, to "
hand in a compla
int about it.”
"

“Well, and"
 what are you go
ing to do? Will 
you stay here if
 the enemy occu
pies the place?�
�� asked Prince 
Andrew.  Alpá
tych turned his 
face to Prince A
"ndrew, looked at"
" him, and sudden"
ly with a solem
n gesture raised
 his arm.  “
He is my refuge!
 His will be don
e!” he exclaim
ed.  A group o
f bareheaded pea
sants was approa
ching across the
 meadow toward 
the prince.  �
"��Well, good-by!"
” said Prince 
"Andrew, bending "
over to Alpátyc
h. “You must 
"go away too, tak"
e away what you 
can and tell the
 serfs to go to 
the Ryazán est
ate or to the on
e near Moscow.�
�  Alpátych c
lung to Prince A
ndrew’s leg an
d burst into sob
s. Gently disen
"gaging himself, "
the prince spurr
ed his horse and
 rode down the 
avenue at a gall
op.  The old m
an was still sit
ting in the orna
"mental garden, l"
ike a fly impas
sive on the face
 of a loved one 
"who is dead, tap"

aking the bast s
"hoe, and two lit"
"tle girls, runni"
ng out from the
 hot house carry
ing in their ski
rts plums they h
ad plucked from 
 the trees there
", came upon Prin"
ce Andrew. On se
eing the young m
"aster,
the elde"
r one with frigh
tened look clutc
hed her younger 
companion by the
 hand and hid w
ith her behind a
" birch tree, not"
 stopping to pic
k up some green
 plums they had 
dropped.  Prin
ce Andrew turned
 away with start
"led haste, unwil"
ling to let them
 see that they 
had been observe
d. He was sorry 
for the pretty f
rightened littl
"e girl, was afra"
id of looking at
" her, and yet fe"
lt an irresistib
le desire to do
 so. A new sensa
tion of comfort 
and relief came 
"over him
when, "
seeing these gir
"ls, he realized "
the existence of
 other human in
terests entirely
 aloof from his 
own and just as 
legitimate as th
ose that occupi
ed him. Evidentl
y these girls pa
ssionately desir
ed one thing—
to carry away an
d eat those gree
n plums without 
being caught—a
nd Prince Andre
w shared their w
ish for the succ
ess of their ent
erprise. He cou
ld not resist lo
oking at them on
ce more. Believi
ng their danger 
"past,
they spra"
ng from their am
"bush and, chirru"
ping something i
n their shrill 
little voices an
d holding up the
"ir skirts, their"
 bare little sun
burned feet sca
mpered merrily a
nd quickly acros
s the meadow gra
ss.  Prince An
drew was somewha
t refreshed by h
aving ridden off
 the dusty high
road along which
 the troops were
 moving. But not
 far from Bald H
ills he again c
ame out on the r
oad and overtook
 his regiment at
 its halting pl
ace by the dam o
f a small pond. 
It was past one 
o’clock. The s
"un,
a red ball "
through the dust
", burned and sco"
rched his back i
ntolerably thro
ugh his black co
at. The dust alw
ays hung motionl
ess above the bu
zz of talk that
 came from the r
esting troops. T
here was no wind
. As he crossed
 the dam Prince 
Andrew smelled t
he ooze and fres
hness of the po
nd. He longed to
 get into that w
"ater, however di"
"rty it might be,"
 and he glanced
 round at the po
ol from whence c
ame sounds of sh
rieks and laugh
"ter. The small, "
"muddy, green pon"
d had risen visi
bly more than a 
"
foot, flooding "
"the dam, because"
 it was full of 
the naked white 
bodies of soldi
ers with brick-r
"ed hands, necks,"
" and faces, who "
were splashing 
about in it. All
 this naked whit
"e human flesh, l"
aughing and shri
"eking,
flounder"
ed about in that
 dirty pool like
 carp stuffed in
to a watering c
"an, and the sugg"
estion of merrim
ent in that flou
ndering mass ren
dered it specia
lly pathetic.  
 One fair-haired
 young soldier o
f the third comp
"any, whom Prince"
 Andrew knew an
d who had a stra
p round the calf
" of one leg, cro"
"ssed himself,
s"
tepped back to g
"et a good run, a"
nd plunged into 
the water; anoth
"er,
a dark nonc"
ommissioned offi
cer who was alwa
"ys shaggy, stood"
 up to his wais
t in the water j
oyfully wrigglin
g his muscular f
igure and snorte
d with satisfac
tion as he poure
d the water over
 his head with h
ands blackened 
to the wrists. T
here were sounds
 of men slapping
" one another,
y"
"elling, and puff"
ing.  Everywhe
"re on the bank, "
"on the dam, and "
"in the pond, the"
"re was healthy,"

with his red lit

 confused at see

the prince,"
 but made up his
 mind to address
 him nevertheles
s.  “It’s 
"very nice, your "
excellency! Woul
dn’t you like 
to?” said he. 
  “It’s dir

"rince Andrew, ma"
king a grimace.

he seventh of Au
gust Prince Bagr
atión wrote as 
follows from his
 quarters at Mi
kháylovna on th
e Smolénsk road
:  Dear Count 
Aléxis Andréev
ich—(He was wr
iting to Arakch�
�ev but knew tha
t his letter wo
uld be read by t
"he Emperor, and "
therefore weighe
d every word in
 it to the best 
of his ability.)
  I expect the
 Minister (Barcl
ay de Tolly) has
 already reporte
d the abandonme
nt of Smolénsk 
to the enemy. It
 is pitiable and
" sad, and
the w"
hole army is in 
despair that thi
s most important
 place has been 
 wantonly abando
"ned. I, for my p"
"art, begged him "
personally most 
urgently and fi
"nally wrote him,"
 but nothing wou
ld induce him to
 consent. I swea
r to you on my 
honor that Napol
eon was in such 
a fix as never b
efore and might
 have lost half 
his army but cou
ld not have take
n Smolénsk. Our
"
troops fought,"
 and are fightin
"g, as never befo"
re. With fifteen
 thousand men I
 held the enemy 
at bay for thirt
y-five hours and
 beat him; but h
e would not hol
d out even for f
ourteen hours. I
t is disgraceful
", a stain
on ou"
"r army, and as f"
"or him, he ought"
", it seems to me"
", not to live. I"
f he reports th
at our losses we
"re great, it is "
not true; perhap
s about four th
"ousand, not more"
", and not even t"
hat; but even we
re they ten tho
"usand, that’s "
war! But the ene
my has lost mass
es....  What w
ould it have cos
t him to hold ou
t for another tw
o days? They wou
ld have had to 
retire of their 
"own accord, for "
they had no wate
r for men or ho
rses. He gave me
 his word he wou
"ld not retreat, "
but suddenly sen
t instructions 
that he was reti
ring that night.
 We cannot fight
" in this
way, o"
r we may soon br
ing the enemy to
 Moscow....  T
here is a rumor 
that you are thi
nking of peace. 
God forbid that 
you should make
 peace after all
 our sacrifices 
and such insane 
retreats! You w
ould set all Rus
sia against you 
and everyone of 
us would feel as
hamed to wear t
he uniform. If i
t has come to th
is—we must fig
ht as long as R
ussia can and as
 long as there a
re men able to s
tand....  One 
man ought to be 
"in command, and "
not two. Your Mi
nister may perha
ps be good as a
" Minister, but a"
s a general he i
s not merely bad
" but
execrable,"
 yet to him is e
ntrusted the fat
e of our whole c
ountry.... I am
 really frantic 
with vexation; f
orgive my writin
g boldly. It is 
clear that the 
man who advocate
s the conclusion
" of a peace, and"
 that the Minis
ter should comma
"nd the army, doe"
s not love our s
overeign and de
sires the ruin o
f us all. So I w
rite you frankly
: call out the 
militia. For the
 Minister is lea
ding these visit
ors after him to
 Moscow in a mo
st masterly way.
 The whole army 
feels great susp
icion of the Im
perial aide-de-c
amp Wolzogen. He
 is said to be m
ore Napoleon’s
" man
than ours,"
 and he is alway
s advising the M
inister. I am no
t merely civil 
to him but obey 
him like a corpo
"ral, though I am"
 his senior. Thi
"s is
painful, b"
"ut, loving my be"
nefactor and sov
"ereign, I submit"
. Only I am sor
ry for the Emper
or that he entru
sts our fine arm
y to such as he.
 Consider that 
on our retreat w
e have lost by f
atigue and left 
in the hospital
 more than fifte
"en thousand men,"
 and had we atta
cked this would 
 not have happen
"ed. Tell me, for"
" God’s sake, w"
"hat will Russia,"
 our mother Rus
"sia, say to our "
being so frighte
"ned, and why are"
 we abandoning o
ur good and gal
lant Fatherland 
to such rabble a
nd implanting fe
elings of hatre
d and shame in a
ll our subjects?
 What are we sca
red at and of wh
om are we afrai
d? I am not to b
lame that the Mi
nister is vacill
"ating,
a coward"
", dense, dilator"
"y, and has all b"
ad qualities. Th
e whole army be
wails it and cal
ls down curses u
pon him....   
    CHAPTER V
I  Among the i
nnumerable categ
ories applicable
 to the phenomen
a of human life
 one may discrim
inate between th
ose in which sub
stance prevails 
 and those in wh
ich form prevail
s. To the latter
—as distinguis
hed from villag
"e, country, prov"
"incial, or even "
Moscow life—we
 may allot Pete
"rsburg life, and"
 especially the 
life of its salo
ns. That life of
 the salons is 
unchanging. Sinc
e the year 1805 
we had made peac
e and had again
 quarreled with 
Bonaparte and ha
d made constitut
ions and unmade 
"
them again, but"
 the salons of A
nna Pávlovna an
d Hélène remai
ned just as the
y had been—the
 one seven and t
he other five ye
ars before. At A
nna Pávlovna�
�s they talked w
ith perplexity o
f Bonaparte’s 
successes just 
as before and sa
w in them and in
 the subservienc
e shown to him b
y the European 
sovereigns a mal
icious conspirac
"y, the sole obje"
ct of which was 
 to cause unplea
santness and anx
iety to the cour
t circle of whic
h Anna Pávlovn
a was the repres
entative. And in
 Hélène’s sa
"lon, which Rumy�"
�ntsev himself 
honored with his
" visits, regardi"
ng Hélène as a
 remarkably int
"elligent woman, "
they talked with
 the same ecstas
y in 1812 as in 
1808 of the “
great nation” 
and the “great
" man,” and reg"
retted our ruptu
"re
with France,"
 a rupture which
", according to t"
"hem, ought to be"
 promptly termi
nated by peace. 
"

Of late, sinc"
e the Emperor’
s return from th
"e army, there ha"
d been some exc
itement in these
 conflicting sal
on circles and s
ome demonstratio
ns of hostility
" to one another,"
 but each camp r
etained its own 
tendency. In An
na Pávlovna’s
 circle only tho
se Frenchmen wer
e admitted who w
ere deep-rooted
" legitimists, an"
d patriotic view
s were expressed
 to the effect 
that one ought n
ot to go to the 
French theater a
nd that to main
tain the French 
troupe was costi
ng the governmen
t as much as a w
hole army corps
. The progress o
f the war was ea
"gerly followed, "
and only the re
ports most flatt
ering to our arm
y were circulate
d. In the French
 circle of Hél
ène and Rumyán
tsev the reports
 of the cruelty 
of the enemy an
d of the war wer
e contradicted a
nd all Napoleon�
��s attempts at 
 conciliation we
re discussed. In
 that circle the
y discountenance
d those who adv
ised hurried pre
parations for a 
removal to Kazá
n of the court a
nd the girls’
 educational est
ablishments unde
r the patronage 
of the Dowager 
Empress. In Hél
ène’s circle 
the war in gener
al was regarded 
as a series of 
formal demonstra
tions which woul
d very soon end 
"in peace, and th"
e view prevaile
d expressed by B
ilíbin—who no
w in Petersburg 
was quite at ho
me in Hélène�
"�s house, which "
every clever man
 was obliged to 
visit—that no
t by gunpowder b
ut by those who 
invented it woul
d matters be se
ttled. In that c
ircle the Moscow
 enthusiasm—ne
ws of which had 
reached Petersb
urg simultaneous
ly with the Empe
ror’s return�
�was ridiculed 
sarcastically an
"d very cleverly,"
 though with muc
h caution.  An
na Pávlovna’s
 circle on the c
ontrary was enra
ptured by this e
nthusiasm and s
poke of it as Pl
utarch speaks of
 the deeds of th
e ancients. Pri
"nce Vasíli, who"
 still occupied 
his former impor
"tant posts, form"
ed a connecting
 link between th
ese two circles.
 He visited his 
“good friend 
Anna Pávlovna�
� as well as his
 daughter’s �
�diplomatic salo
"n,” and often"
 in his constant
 comings and goi
ngs between the 
two camps became
 confused and s
aid at Hélène�
��s what he shou
ld have said at 
Anna Pávlovna�
�s and vice ver
sa.  Soon afte
r the Emperor’
s return Prince 
Vasíli in a con
versation about 
 the war at Anna
 Pávlovna’s s
everely condemne
d Barclay de Tol
"ly, but was
und"
ecided as to who
 ought to be app
ointed commander
 in chief. One o
"f the
visitors,"
 usually spoken 
of as “a man o
"f great merit,�"
� having describ
ed how he had t
hat day seen Kut
"úzov, the newly"
 chosen chief of
 the Petersburg
" militia, presid"
ing over the enr
ollment of recru
its at the Trea
"sury, cautiously"
 ventured to sug
gest that Kutúz
ov would be the 
man to satisfy 
all requirements
.  Anna Pávlo
vna remarked wit
h a melancholy s
mile that Kutúz
ov had done not
hing but cause t
he Emperor annoy
ance.  “I ha
ve talked and ta
lked at the Asse
mbly of the Nobi
"lity,” Prince"
 Vasíli interru
"pted, “but the"
y did not listen
 to me. I told t
hem his electio
n as chief of th
e militia would 
not please the E
mperor. They did
 not listen to 
me.  “It’s
 all this mania 
"for opposition,�"
�� he went on. �
��And who for? I
t is all becaus
e we want to ape
 the foolish ent
husiasm of those
" Muscovites,”"
 Prince Vasíli 
"continued, forge"
tting for a mome
nt that though a
t Hélène’s 
one had to ridic
ule the Moscow e
"nthusiasm, at An"
na Pávlovna’s
 one had to be 
ecstatic about i
t. But he retrie
ved his mistake 
"at once. “Now,"
 is it suitable
 that Count Kut�
"�zov, the oldest"
 general in Russ
"ia, should
pres"
ide at that trib
unal? He will ge
t nothing for hi
s pains! How cou
ld they make a 
man commander in
 chief who canno
"t mount a horse,"
 who drops asle
"ep at a council,"
 and has the ver
y worst morals! 
A good reputatio
n he made for h
imself at Buchar
est! I don’t s
peak of his capa
city as a gener
"al, but at a tim"
e like this how 
they appoint a d
"ecrepit, blind o"
"ld
man, positiv"
ely blind? A fin
e idea to have a
 blind general! 
He can’t see 
anything. To pla
y blindman’s b
ulff? He can’t
 see at all!” 
  No one replie
d to his remarks
.  This was qu
ite correct on t
he twenty-fourth
 of July. But on
 the twenty-nin
th of July Kutú
zov received the
 title of Prince
. This might in
dicate a wish to
" get rid of him,"
 and therefore P
rince Vasíli’
s opinion conti
nued to be corre
ct though he was
 not now in any 
hurry to express
 it. But on the
 eighth of Augus
"t a committee, c"
onsisting of Fie
ld Marshal Salt
"ykóv, Arakchée"
"v, Vyazmítinov,"
" Lopukhín, and "
Kochubéy met to
 consider the p
rogress of the w
ar. This committ
ee came to the c
onclusion that 
our failures wer
e due to a want 
of unity in the 
command and thou
gh the members 
of the committee
 were aware of t
he Emperor’s d
islike of Kutúz
"ov,
after a sho"
rt deliberation 
they agreed to a
dvise his appoin
tment as comman
der in chief. Th
at same day Kut�
�zov was appoint
ed commander in
 chief with full
 powers over the
 armies and over
 the whole regio
n occupied by t
hem.  On the n
inth of August P
rince Vasíli at
 Anna Pávlovna�
��s again met th
e “man of gre
at merit.” The
 latter was very
 attentive to An
na Pávlovna be
cause he wanted 
to be appointed 
director of one 
of the education
al establishmen
ts for young lad
ies. Prince Vas�
�li entered the 
room with the a
ir of a happy co
nqueror who has 
attained the obj
ect of his desir
"es.

“Well, "
have you heard t
he great news? P
rince Kutúzov i
s field marshal!
 All dissension
s are at an end!
" I am so glad, s"
o delighted! At 
last we have a 
"man!” said he,"
 glancing sternl
y and significan
tly round at ev
eryone in the dr
awing room.  T
he “man of gre
"at merit,” des"
pite his desire 
to obtain the po
"st of
director,"
 could not refra
in from remindin
g Prince Vasíli
 of his former 
opinion. Though 
this was impolit
e to Prince Vas�
�li in Anna Páv
lovna’s drawi
"ng room, and als"
o to Anna Pávlo
vna herself who 
had received the
 news with deli
"ght, he could no"
t resist the tem
ptation.  “B
"ut, Prince, they"
 say he is blind
"!” said he, re"
minding Prince V
asíli of his o
wn words.  “
Eh? Nonsense! He
 sees well enoug
"h,” said Princ"
e Vasíli rapidl
"y, in a
deep vo"
ice and with a s
light cough—th
e voice and coug
h with which he 
was wont to dis
pose of all diff
iculties.  “
He sees well eno
"ugh,” he added"
. “And what I 
am so pleased ab
"out,” he
went"
" on, “is that "
our sovereign ha
s given him full
 powers over all
 the armies and
 the whole regio
n—powers no co
mmander in chief
 ever had befor
e. He is a secon
"d autocrat,” h"
e concluded with
 a victorious sm
ile.  “God g
rant it! God gra
nt it!” said A
nna Pávlovna. 
 The “man of 
"great merit,” "
who was still a 
novice in court 
"circles,
wishin"
g to flatter Ann
a Pávlovna by d
efending her for
mer position on 
"
this question, "
observed:  “
It is said that 
the Emperor was 
reluctant to giv
e Kutúzov those
 powers. They s
ay he blushed li
ke a girl to who
m Joconde is rea
"d, when he said "
to Kutúzov: �
�Your Emperor an
d the Fatherland
 award you this 
honor.’”  
“Perhaps the h
eart took no par
t in that speech
",” said Anna P"
ávlovna.  “
"Oh, no, no!” w"
armly rejoined P
"rince Vasíli, w"
ho would not now
 yield Kutúzov
 to anyone; in h
is opinion Kutú
zov was not only
 admirable hims
"elf, but was ado"
red by everybody
". “No, that’"
"s impossible,”"
" said he,
“fo"
r our sovereign 
appreciated him 
so highly before
.”  “God g
rant only that P
rince Kutúzov a
ssumes real powe
r and does not 
allow anyone to 
put a spoke in h
"is wheel,” obs"
erved Anna Pávl
ovna.  Underst
anding at once t
o whom she allud
"ed, Prince Vasí"
li said in a wh
isper:  “I k
now for a fact t
hat Kutúzov mad
e it an absolute
 condition that 
the Tsarévich 
should not be wi
th the army. Do 
you know what he
 said to the Em
peror?”  And
 Prince Vasíli 
repeated the wor
ds supposed to h
ave been spoken 
by Kutúzov to 
the Emperor. “
I can neither pu
nish him if he d
oes wrong nor r
eward him if he 
does right.” 
"
“Oh, a very "
wise man is Prin
ce Kutúzov! I h
ave known him a 
long time!”  
 “They even sa
"y,” remarked t"
he “man of gre
at merit” who 
did not yet pos
sess courtly tac
"t, “that his e"
xcellency made i
t an express con
dition that the
 sovereign himse
lf should not be
 with the army.�
��  As soon as
 he said this bo
th Prince Vasíl
i and Anna Pávl
ovna turned away
 from him and g
lanced sadly at 
one another with
 a sigh at his n
aïveté.    
   CHAPTER VII
  While this w
as taking place 
in Petersburg th
e French had alr
eady passed Smo
lénsk and were 
drawing nearer a
nd nearer to Mos
cow. Napoleon’
s historian Thi
"ers, like other "
of his historian
"s, trying to jus"
tify his hero s
ays that he was 
drawn to the wal
ls of Moscow aga
inst his will. H
e is as right a
s other historia
ns who look for 
the explanation 
of historic eve
nts in the will 
of one man; he i
s as right as th
e Russian histor
ians who mainta
in that Napoleon
 was drawn to Mo
scow by the skil

splayer having l
ost a game is si
ncerely convince
d that his loss 
 resulted from a
 mistake he made
 and looks for t
hat mistake in t
"he
opening, but"
 forgets that at
 each stage of t
he game there we
re similar mist
akes and that no
ne of his moves 
were perfect. He
 only notices th
e mistake to wh
ich he pays atte
"ntion, because h"
is opponent took
 advantage of i
t. How much more
 complex than th
is is the game o

in limits of tim
"e, and where it "
is not one will 
that manipulate
s lifeless objec

ollowed by Lelo

   “Well?�
� asked Napoleon
.  “One of P
látov’s Cossa
cks says that Pl
átov’s corps 
is joining up wi
th the main arm
y and that Kutú
zov has been app

 in chief. He i

and garrulous fe

leon smiled and 
told them to giv
e the Cossack a 
horse and bring 
the man to him.
 He wished to ta

ants galloped o

"later, Lavrúshk"

"with a merry, an"

poleon told him 
to ride by his 
side and began q
uestioning him. 
  “You are a 
Cossack?”  �
"��Yes, a Cossack"
", your Honor.”"
  “The Cossa
"ck, not knowing "
in what company 
"he was, for Napo"
leon’s plain 
appearance had n
othing about it 
that would revea
l to an Oriental
 mind the prese
nce of a monarch
", talked with ex"
treme familiarit
y of the incide

"�� says Thiers, "
narrating this e
pisode. In real

 had been whippe

 Lavrúshka was 
one of those coa

lackeys who have
 seen all sorts
" of things, cons"
ider it necessar
y to do everythi
ng in a mean and
"
cunning way, a"
re ready to rend

 keen at guessin
g their master�
�s baser impulse
"s, especially th"
ose prompted by
 vanity and pett
iness.  Findin
g himself in the
 company of Napo
"leon, whose iden"
tity he had easi
ly and surely r
"ecognized, Lavr�"
�shka was not in
 the least abash
ed but merely d
id his utmost to
 gain his new ma
ster’s favor. 
  He knew very 
well that this w
"as Napoleon, but"
 Napoleon’s pr
esence could no
 more intimidate
 him than Rostó
"v’s, or a serg"
eant major’s w
"ith the
rods, w"
"ould have done, "
for he had nothi
ng that either t
he sergeant majo
r or Napoleon c
ould deprive him
 of.  So he ra
"ttled on, tellin"
g all the gossip
 he had heard am
ong the orderli
es. Much of it t
rue. But when Na
poleon asked him
 whether the Ru
ssians thought t
hey would beat B
"onaparte or not,"
 Lavrúshka scre
wed up his eyes
 and considered.
  In this ques
tion he saw subt
"le cunning, as m"
en of his type s
ee cunning in e
"verything, so he"
 frowned and did
 not answer imme
diately.  “I
"t’s like this,"
” he said thou
"ghtfully, “if "
there’s a batt
"le soon, yours
"
will win. That�
�s right. But if
 three days pass
", then after tha"
"t, well,
then t"
hat same battle 
will not soon be
 over.”  Lel
orgne d’Idevil
le smilingly int
erpreted this sp
eech to Napoleon
 thus: “If a 
battle takes pla
ce within the ne
xt three days th
e French will w
"in, but if later"

 Napoleon did no

though"
 he was evidentl
y in high good h
"umor, and he ord"
ered these words
 to be repeated
.  Lavrúshka 
noticed this and
 to entertain hi
"m further, prete"
nding not to kn
ow who Napoleon 
"was, added:

�"
��We know that y
ou have Bonapart
e and that he ha
s beaten everybo
dy in the world
", but we are a d"
ifferent matter.
..”—without 
knowing why or h
ow this bit of 
boastful patriot
ism slipped out 
at the end.  T
he interpreter t
ranslated these 
words without th
"e last phrase, a"
nd Bonaparte sm
iled. “The you
ng Cossack made 
his mighty inter
"locutor
smile,�"
�� says Thiers. 
After riding a f
ew paces in sile
"nce, Napoleon
t"
urned to Berthie
r and said he wi
shed to see how 
the news that he
 was talking to
 the Emperor him
"self, to that ve"
ry Emperor who h
ad written his 
immortally victo
rious name on th
"e Pyramids, woul"
d affect this en
fant du Don. * 
      * “Chil

   The fact w
as accordingly c
onveyed to Lavr�

"shka, understand"
ing that this wa

Napoleon expecte

fy his new maste

tended to be ast

"struck, opened h"
"is eyes

"s Thiers,
“th"
"e Cossack, seize"

did not utter an
"other word, but "
"rode

conqueror whose 
fame had reached
 him across the
 steppes of the 
East. All his lo

enly arrested an

 naïve and sile

  CHAPTER VIII
  Princess Mar
y was not in Mos
cow and out of d
anger as Prince 
Andrew supposed
.  After the r
eturn of Alpáty
ch from Smoléns
k the old prince
 suddenly seeme
d to awake as fr
om a dream. He o
rdered the milit
iamen to be call
ed up from the 
villages and arm
"ed, and wrote a "
letter to the co
mmander in chie
f informing him 
that he had reso
lved to remain a
t Bald Hills to 
the last extrem
ity and to defen
"d it, leaving to"
 the commander i
n chief’s dis
cretion to take 
measures or not 
for the defense 
"of Bald Hills, w"
here one of Rus
sia’s oldest g
enerals would be
 captured or kil
"led, and he
ann"
ounced to his ho
usehold that he 
would remain at 
Bald Hills.  B
ut while himself
" remaining, he g"
ave instructions
 for the departu
re of the princ
ess and Dessalle
s with the littl
e prince to Bogu
chárovo and th
ence to Moscow. 
"Princess Mary, a"
larmed by her fa
ther’s feveris
h and sleepless
 activity after 
his previous apa
"thy, could not b"
ring herself to 
 leave him alone
 and for the fir
st time in her l
ife ventured to 
disobey him. Sh
e refused to go 
away and her fat
her’s fury bro
ke over her in a
 terrible storm
. He repeated ev
ery injustice he
 had ever inflic
ted on her. Try
ing to convict h
"er, he told her "
she had worn him
" out, had caused"
 his quarrel wi
"th his son, had "
harbored nasty s
uspicions of him
", making
it the"
 object of her l
ife to poison hi
"s existence, and"
 he drove her fr
om his study te
lling her that i
f she did not go
 away it was all
 the same to hi
m. He declared t
hat he did not w
ish to remember 
her existence an
d warned her no
t to dare to let
 him see her. Th
e fact that he d
"id not, as
she "
"had feared, orde"
r her to be carr
ied away by forc
e but only told 
her not to let 
him see her chee
red Princess Mar
y. She knew it w
as a proof that
 in the depth of
 his soul he was
 glad she was re
maining at home 
and had not gon
e away.  The m
orning after lit
tle Nicholas had
" left, the old p"
rince donned his
 full uniform a
nd prepared to v
isit the command
er in chief. His
 calèche was a
lready at the do
or. Princess Mar
y saw him walk o
ut of the house 
in his uniform 
wearing all his 
orders and go do
wn the garden to
 review his arm
ed peasants and 
domestic serfs. 
She sat by the w
indow listening 
to his voice wh
ich reached her 
from the garden.
 Suddenly severa
l men came runn
ing up the avenu
e with frightene
d faces.  Prin
cess Mary ran ou
"t to the porch, "
down the flower-
"bordered path, a"
nd into the ave
nue. A large cro
wd of militiamen
 and domestics w
ere moving towa
"rd her, and in t"
heir midst sever
al men were supp
orting by the a
rmpits and dragg
ing along a litt
le old man in a 
uniform and dec
orations. She ra
"n up to him and,"
 in the play of 
the sunlight tha
t fell in small
 round spots thr
ough the shade o
f the lime-tree 
"avenue,
could n"
ot be sure what 
change there was
 in his face. Al
l she could see 
 was that his fo
rmer stern and d
etermined expres
sion had altered
 to one of timi
dity and submiss
ion. On seeing h
is daughter he m
oved his helples
s lips and made
 a hoarse sound.
 It was impossib
le to make out w
hat he wanted. 
He was lifted up
", carried to his"
" study, and laid"
 on the very co
uch he had so fe
ared of late.  
"
The doctor, who"
 was fetched tha
"t same night, bl"
ed him and said 
that the prince
 had had a seizu
re paralyzing hi
s right side.  
 It was becoming
 more and more d
angerous to rema
in at Bald Hills
", and
next day "
they moved the p
rince to Boguch�
"�rovo, the docto"
r accompanying 
him.  By the t
ime they reached
" Boguchárovo, D"
essalles and the
 little prince 
had already left
 for Moscow.  
For three weeks 
the old prince l
ay stricken by p
aralysis in the 
new house Princ
e Andrew had bui
lt at Bogucháro
"vo, ever in the "
"same state,
get"
ting neither bet
ter nor worse. H
e was unconsciou
s and lay like 
a distorted corp
se. He muttered 
"unceasingly, his"
 eyebrows and li
"ps
twitching, a"
nd it was imposs
ible to tell whe
ther he understo
od what was goi
ng on around him
 or not. One thi
ng was certain�
�that he was suf
fering and wish
ed to say someth
ing. But what it
" was, no one cou"
ld tell: it mig
ht be some capri
ce of a sick and
" half-crazy man,"
 or it might rel
ate to public a
"ffairs, or possi"
bly to family co
ncerns.  The d
octor said this 
restlessness did
 not mean anythi
ng and was due 
to physical caus
es; but Princess
 Mary thought he
 wished to tell 
"
her something, "
and the fact tha
t her presence a
lways increased 
his restlessnes
s confirmed her 
opinion.  He w
as evidently suf
fering both phys
ically and menta
lly. There was n
o hope of recov
ery. It was impo
ssible for him t
"o travel, it wou"
ld not do to le
t him die on the
 road. “Would 
it not be better
 if the end did 
"come,
the very "
end?” Princess
 Mary sometimes 
thought. Night a
"nd day, hardly
"
"sleeping at all,"
 she watched him
" and, terrible t"
"o say, often wat"
ched him not wi
th hope of findi
ng signs of impr
ovement but wish
ing to find sym
ptoms of the app
roach of the end
.  Strange as 
it was to her to
 acknowledge thi
s feeling in her
"self, yet
there"
 it was. And wha
t seemed still m
ore terrible to 
her was that sin
ce her father�
�s illness began
 (perhaps even s
"ooner, when she "
stayed with him
 expecting somet
"hing to happen),"
 all the persona
l desires and ho
pes that had be
en forgotten or 
sleeping within 
her had awakened
. Thoughts that
 had not entered
 her mind for ye
ars—thoughts o
f a life free fr
om the fear of 
"her father, and "
even the possibi
lity of love and
 of family happ
iness—floated 
continually in h
er imagination l
ike temptations 
of the devil. T
hrust them aside
" as she would, q"
uestions continu
ally recurred t
o her as to how 
she would order 
"her life now, af"
ter that. These 
were temptation
s of the devil a
nd Princess Mary
 knew it. She kn
ew that the sol
e weapon against
" him was prayer,"
 and she tried t
o pray. She assu
med an attitude
" of prayer, look"
"ed at the icons,"
 repeated the wo
rds of a prayer
", but she could "
not pray. She fe
lt that a differ
ent world had n
ow taken possess
ion of her—the
 life of a world
 of strenuous an
d free activity
", quite opposed "
to the spiritual
 world in which 
till now she ha
d been confined 
and in which her
 greatest comfor
t had been praye
r. She could no
"t pray, could no"
"t weep, and worl"
dly cares took p
ossession of he
r.  It was bec
oming dangerous 
to remain in Bog
uchárovo. News 
of the approach 
 of the French c
ame from all sid
"es, and in one v"
"illage, ten mile"
s from Boguchá
"rovo, a homestea"
d had been loote
d by French mara
uders.  The do
ctor insisted on
 the necessity o
f moving the pri
nce; the provin
cial Marshal of 
the Nobility sen
t an official to
 Princess Mary 
to persuade her 
to get away as q
uickly as possib
"le, and the head"
 of the rural p
olice having com
e to Boguchárov
o urged the same
" thing, saying
"
that the French 
were only some t
wenty-five miles
" away, that Fren"
ch proclamation
s were circulati
ng in the villag
"es, and that if "
the princess di
d not take her f
ather away befor
"e the fifteenth,"
 he could not an
swer for the co
nsequences.  T
he princess deci
ded to leave on 
the fifteenth. T
he cares of prep
aration and giv
"ing orders, for "
which everyone c
"ame to her, occu"
pied her all day
. She spent the
 night of the fo
urteenth as usua
"l, without undre"
"ssing, in
the r"
oom next to the 
one where the pr
ince lay. Severa
"l times, waking "
"up,
she heard h"
is groans and mu
"ttering, the cre"
"ak of his bed, a"
nd the steps of
 Tíkhon and the
 doctor when the
y turned him ove
r. Several times
 she listened a
"t the door, and "
it seemed to her
 that his mutter
ings were loude
r than usual and
 that they turne
d him over often
er. She could no
t sleep and sev
eral times went 
to the door and 
"listened, wishin"
g to enter but 
not deciding to 
do so. Though he
" did not speak, "
Princess Mary sa
w and knew how 
unpleasant every
 sign of anxiety
 on his account 
was to him. She
 had noticed wit
h what dissatisf
action he turned
 from the look s
he sometimes in
voluntarily fixe
d on him. She kn
ew that her goin
g in during the
 night at an unu
sual hour would 
irritate him.  
 But never had s
he felt so griev
ed for him or so
 much afraid of 
losing him. She
 recalled all he
r life with him 
and in every wor
d and act of his
 found an expre
ssion of his lov
e of her. Occasi
onally amid thes
e memories temp
tations of the d
evil would surge
 into her imagin
ation: thoughts 
of how things w
ould be after hi
"s death, and how"
" her new, libera"
ted life would 
be ordered. But 
she drove these 
thoughts away wi
th disgust. Towa
rd morning he b
ecame quiet and 
she fell asleep.
  She woke lat
e. That sincerit
y which often co
mes with waking 
showed her clea
rly what chiefly
 concerned her a
bout her father�
��s illness. On 
waking she list
ened to what was
 going on behind
" the door and, h"
earing him groa
"n, said to herse"
lf with a sigh t
hat things were 
still the same. 
  “But what c
ould have happen
ed? What did I w
ant? I want his 
death!” she c
ried with a feel
ing of loathing 
for herself.  
"She washed, dres"
"sed, said her pr"
"ayers, and went "
out to the porch
. In front of i
t stood carriage
s without horses
 and things were
 being packed i
nto the vehicles
.  It was a wa
"rm, gray morning"
. Princess Mary 
stopped at the p
"orch, still
hor"
rified by her sp
iritual baseness
 and trying to a
rrange her thoug
hts before goin
g to her father.
 The doctor came
 downstairs and 
went out to her
.  “He is a 
little better to
"day,” said he."
 “I was lookin
g for you. One c
an make out som
ething of what h
e is saying. His
 head is clearer
". Come in,
he i"
s asking for you
....”  Princ
ess Mary’s hea
rt beat so viole
ntly at this new
s that she grew 
pale and leaned
 against the wal
l to keep from f
alling. To see h
"im, talk to
him"
", feel his eyes "
on her now that 
her whole soul w
as overflowing w
ith those dread
"ful, wicked temp"
"tations, was a t"
orment of joy an
d terror.  “
"Come,” said th"
e doctor.  Pri
ncess Mary enter
ed her father’
s room and went 
up to his bed. H
e was lying on 
his back propped
" up high, and hi"
s small bony han
ds with their k
notted purple ve
ins were lying o
n the quilt; his
 left eye gazed 
 straight before
" him, his right "
"eye was awry, an"
d his brows and 
lips motionless
. He seemed alto
"gether so thin, "
"small, and pathe"
tic. His face s
eemed to have sh
riveled or melte
d; his features 
had grown smalle
r. Princess Mar
y went up and ki
ssed his hand. H
is left hand pre
ssed hers so th
at she understoo
d that he had lo
ng been waiting 
for her to come.
 He twitched he
"r hand, and his "
brows and lips q
uivered angrily.
  She looked a
t him in dismay 
trying to guess 
what he wanted o
f her. When she
 changed her pos
ition so that hi
s left eye could
 see her face he
"
calmed down, n"
ot taking his ey
es off her for s
ome seconds. The
n his lips and 
"tongue moved, so"
"unds came, and h"
e began to speak
", gazing timidly"
 and imploringl
"y at her, eviden"
tly afraid that 
she might not un
derstand.  Str
aining all her f
aculties Princes
s Mary looked at
 him. The comic 
 efforts with wh
ich he moved his
 tongue made her
 drop her eyes a
nd with difficu
lty repress the 
sobs that rose t
o her throat. He
" said something,"
 repeating the 
same words sever
al times. She co
uld not understa
"nd them,
but tr"
ied to guess wha
t he was saying 
and inquiringly 
repeated the wor
ds he uttered. 
  “Mmm...ar..
.ate...ate...”
 he repeated sev
eral times.  I
t was quite impo
ssible to unders
tand these sound
s. The doctor th
ought he had gu
"essed them, and "
inquiringly repe
"ated: “Mary, a"
re you afraid?�
� The prince sh
"ook his head, ag"
ain repeated the
 same sounds.  
"
“My mind, my "
mind aches?” q
uestioned Prince
ss Mary.  He m
ade a mumbling s
ound in confirma
"tion of this, to"
"ok her hand, and"
 began pressing
 it to different
 parts of his br
east as if tryin
g to find the r
ight place for i
t.  “Always 
thoughts... abou
t you... thought
s...” he then 
uttered much mo
re clearly than 
he had done befo
"re, now that he "
was sure of bein
g understood. 
 Princess Mary 
pressed her head
 against his han
"d, trying to hid"
e her sobs and 
tears.  He mov
ed his hand over
 her hair.  �
�I have been cal
ling you all nig
ht...” he brou
ght out.  “I
f only I had kno
wn...” she sai
d through her te
ars. “I was af
raid to come in
.”  He press
ed her hand.  
“Weren’t you
 asleep?”  �
"��No, I did not "
"sleep,” said P"
"rincess Mary, sh"
aking her head. 
  Unconsciously
 imitating her f
"ather, she now t"
ried to express 
herself as he d
"id, as much as p"
ossible by signs
", and her tongue"
 too seemed to m
ove with diffic
ulty.  “Dear
 one... Dearest.
..” Princess M
ary could not qu
ite make out wha
"t he
had said, "
but from his loo
k it was clear t
hat he had utter
ed a tender car
essing word such
 as he had never
 used to her bef
ore. “Why didn
’t you come i
n?”  “And 
I was wishing fo
r his death!” 
thought Princess
 Mary.  He was
 silent awhile. 
  “Thank you.
.. daughter dear
"!... for all, fo"
r all... forgive
!... thank you!
... forgive!... 
thank you!...”
 and tears began
 to flow from hi
s eyes. “Call
 Andrew!” he s
"aid suddenly, an"
"d a childish, ti"
mid expression 
of doubt showed 
itself on his fa
ce as he spoke. 
  He himself se
emed aware that 
his demand was m
eaningless. So a
t least it seem
ed to Princess M
ary.  “I hav
e a letter from 
"him,” she repl"
ied.  He glanc
ed at her with t
imid surprise. 
 “Where is he
?”  “He’
"s with the army,"
" Father, at Smol"
énsk.”  He 
closed his eyes 
and remained sil
ent a long time.
 Then as if in 
answer to his do
ubts and to conf
irm the fact tha
t now he underst
ood and remembe
"red everything, "
he nodded his he
ad and reopened 
his eyes.  “
"Yes,” he said,"
 softly and dist
inctly. “Russi
a has perished. 
They’ve destr
oyed her.”  
And he began to 
"sob, and again t"
ears flowed from
 his eyes. Princ
ess Mary could 
no longer restra
in herself and w
ept while she ga
zed at his face.
  Again he clo
sed his eyes. Hi
"s sobs ceased, h"
e pointed to his
" eyes, and
Tík"
"hon, understandi"
"ng him, wiped aw"
ay the tears.  
 Then he again o
pened his eyes a
nd said somethin
g none of them c
ould understand
 for a long time
", till at last T"
íkhon understoo
d and repeated 
it. Princess Mar
y had sought the
 meaning of his 
words in the moo
d in which he h
ad just been spe
aking. She thoug
ht he was speaki
"ng of Russia,
o"
"r Prince Andrew,"
" of herself, of "
"his grandson, or"
 of his own deat
"h, and
so she c"
ould not guess h
is words.  “
Put on your whit
e dress. I like 
"it,” was what "
he said.  Havi
ng understood th
is Princess Mary
 sobbed still lo
"uder, and the do"
ctor taking her
 arm led her out
" to the veranda,"
 soothing her an
d trying to per
suade her to pre
pare for her jou
rney. When she h
ad left the room
 the prince aga
in began speakin
"g about his son,"
" about the war, "
and about the E
"mperor, angrily "
twitching his br
ows and raising 
his hoarse voice
", and
then he h"
ad a second and 
final stroke.  
 Princess Mary s
tayed on the ver
anda. The day ha
"d cleared, it wa"
s hot and sunny
. She could unde
"rstand nothing, "
think of nothing
 and feel nothin
"g,
except passi"
onate love for h
"er father, love "
such as she thou
ght she had nev
er felt till tha
t moment. She ra
n out sobbing in
to the garden an
d as far as the
" pond, along the"
 avenues of youn
g lime trees Pri
nce Andrew had 
planted.  “Y
es... I... I... 
I wished for his
" death! Yes, I w"
anted it to end 
 quicker.... I w
ished to be at p
eace.... And wha
t will become of
 me? What use w
ill peace be whe
n he is no longe
r here?” Princ
ess Mary murmure
"d,
pacing the g"
arden with hurri
ed steps and pre
ssing her hands 
to her bosom wh
ich heaved with 
convulsive sobs.
  When she had
 completed the t
our of the garde
"n, which brought"
 her again to t
"he house, she sa"
w Mademoiselle B
ourienne—who h
ad remained at 
Boguchárovo and
 did not wish to
 leave it—comi
ng toward her wi
th a stranger. 
This was the Mar
shal of the Nobi
lity of the dist
"rict, who
had c"
ome personally t
o point out to t
he princess the 
necessity for he
r prompt depart
ure. Princess Ma
ry listened with
out understandin
g him; she led 
him to the house
", offered him lu"
"nch, and sat dow"
n with him. Then
",
excusing hers"
"elf, she went to"
 the door of the
 old prince’s 
room. The docto
r came out with 
an agitated face
 and said she co
uld not enter. 
"
“Go away, Pr"
incess! Go away.
.. go away!” 
 She returned t
o the garden and
 sat down on the
 grass at the fo
ot of the slope
" by the pond, wh"
ere no one could
 see her. She di
d not know how 
long she had bee
n there when she
 was aroused by 
the sound of a w
oman’s footst
eps running alon
g the path. She 
rose and saw Dun
"yásha her maid,"
 who was eviden
tly looking for 
"her, and who sto"
pped suddenly as
 if in alarm on
 seeing her mist
ress.  “Plea
"se come, Princes"
"s... The Prince,"
” said Dunyás
ha in a breaking
 voice.  “I
"mmediately, I’"
"m coming, I’m "
coming!” repli
ed the princess 
"hurriedly,
not "
giving Dunyásha
 time to finish 
what she was say
"ing, and trying "
to avoid seeing
 the girl she ra
n toward the hou
se.  “Prince
"ss, it’s God�"
�s will! You mus
t be prepared fo
"r everything,”"
 said the Marsh
"al, meeting her "
at the house doo
r.  “Let me 
alone; it’s no
t true!” she c
ried angrily to 
him.  The doct
or tried to stop
 her. She pushed
 him aside and r
an to her fathe
r’s door. “W

ng me? I don’
t want any of th
em! And what are
 they doing here
?” she thought
. She opened th
e door and the b
right daylight i
n that previousl
y darkened room
 startled her. I
n the room were 
her nurse and ot
her women. They 
all drew back f
"rom the bed, mak"
ing way for her.
 He was still ly
ing on the bed 
"as before, but t"
he stern express
ion of his quiet
 face made Princ
ess Mary stop s
hort on the thre
"shold.

“No,"
 he’s not dead
—it’s imposs
ible!” she tol
d herself and ap
"proached
him, a"
nd repressing th
e terror that se
"ized her, she pr"
essed her lips 
to his cheek. Bu
t she stepped ba
ck immediately. 
All the force of
 the tenderness
 she had been fe
eling for him va
nished instantly
 and was replac
ed by a feeling 
of horror at wha
t lay there befo
"re her. “No, h"
e is no more! H
"e is not, but he"
re where he was 
is something unf
amiliar and hos
"tile, some dread"
"ful, terrifying,"
 and repellent m
ystery!” And h
iding her face 
"in her hands, Pr"
incess Mary sank
 into the arms o
"f the doctor,
w"
ho held her up. 
   In the pres
ence of Tíkhon 
and the doctor t
he women washed 
what had been t
"he prince, tied "
his head up with
 a handkerchief 
that the mouth s
hould not stiff
"en while open, a"
nd with another 
handkerchief tie
d together the 
legs that were a
lready spreading
 apart. Then the
y dressed him in
 uniform with h
is decorations a
nd placed his sh
riveled little b
ody on a table. 
 Heaven only kno
ws who arranged 
all this and whe
"n, but it all go"
t done as if of

 Toward night ca

 the floor was s
trewn with spray

juniper, a"
 printed band wa

"head, and in a
"
corner of the ro

    CHAPTER 
IX  Until Prin
ce Andrew settle
d in Boguchárov
o its owners had
 always been ab
"sentees, and its"
 peasants were o
f quite a differ
ent character fr
om those of Bal
d Hills. They di
ffered from them
" in speech, dres"
"s, and
disposit"
ion. They were c
alled steppe pea
sants. The old p
rince used to a
pprove of them f
or their enduran
ce at work when 
they came to Bal
d Hills to help
 with the harves
"t, or to dig pon"
"ds and ditches, "
but he disliked 
 them for their 
boorishness.  
Prince Andrew’
s last stay at B
"oguchárovo, whe"
n he introduced 
hospitals and s
chools and reduc
ed the quitrent 
the peasants had
" to pay, had not"
 softened their
 disposition but
 had on the cont
rary strengthene
d in them the t
raits of charact
er the old princ
e called boorish
ness. Various o
bscure rumors we
re always curren
t among them: at
 one time a rumo
r that they wou
ld all be enroll
ed as Cossacks; 
at another of a 
new religion to 
 which they were
 all to be conve
rted; then of so
me proclamation 
of the Tsar’s
 and of an oath 
to the Tsar Paul
 in 1797 (in con
nection with whi
ch it was rumor
ed that freedom 
had been granted
 them but the la
ndowners had st
"opped it), then "
of Peter Fëdoro
vich’s return 
to the throne in
 seven years’
" time, when ever"
ything would be 
made free and so
 “simple” th
at there would 
be no restrictio
ns. Rumors of th
e war with Bonap
arte and his in
vasion were conn
ected in their m
inds with the sa
me sort of vague
 notions of Ant
"ichrist, the end"
" of the world, a"
nd “pure freed
om.”  In the
 vicinity of Bog
uchárovo were l
arge villages be
longing to the 
crown or to owne
rs whose serfs p
aid quitrent and
 could work wher
e they pleased.
 There were very
 few resident la
ndlords in the n
eighborhood and
 also very few d
omestic or liter
"ate serfs, and i"
n the lives of t
he peasantry of
 those parts the
 mysterious unde
rcurrents in the
 life of the Ru
"ssian people, th"
e causes and mea
ning of which ar
e so baffling to
 contemporaries
", were more clea"
rly and strongly
 noticeable than
 among others. 
"One instance, wh"
ich had occurred
 some twenty yea
"rs before, was
"
a movement among
 the peasants to
 emigrate to som
e unknown “war
m rivers.” Hu
ndreds of peasan
"ts, among them t"
he Boguchárovo 
"folk, suddenly b"
egan selling th
eir cattle and m
oving in whole f
amilies toward t
he southeast. A
s birds migrate 
to somewhere bey
"ond the sea, so "
these men with t
heir wives and 
children streame
d to the southea
"st, to parts whe"
re none of them
 had ever been. 
They set off in 
"caravans, bought"
 their freedom o
ne by one or ra
"n away, and drov"
e or walked towa
rd the “warm r
ivers.” Many 
of them were pun
"ished, some sent"
" to Siberia, man"
y died of cold a
nd hunger on th
"e road, many ret"
urned of their o
"wn accord, and t"
he movement die
d down of itself
 just as it had 
"sprung up, witho"
ut apparent reas
on. But such un
dercurrents stil
l existed among 
the people and g
athered new for
ces ready to man
ifest themselves
 just as strange
"ly, unexpectedly"
", and
at the sa"
"me time simply, "
"naturally, and f"
orcibly. Now in 
"1812, to anyone"
 living in close
 touch with thes
e people it was 
apparent that th
ese undercurren
ts were acting s
trongly and near
ing an eruption.
"

Alpátych, w"
ho had reached B
oguchárovo shor
tly before the o
ld prince’s d
"eath, noticed an"
 agitation among
" the peasants, a"
nd that contrary
 to what was ha
ppening in the B
ald Hills distri
"ct, where over a"
 radius of fort
y miles all the 
peasants were mo
ving away and le
aving their vill
ages to be deva
stated by the Co
"ssacks, the peas"
ants in the step
pe region round
 Boguchárovo we
"re, it was rumor"
"ed, in touch wit"
"h the French,
r"
eceived leaflets
 from them that 
passed from hand
" to hand, and di"
d not migrate. 
He learned from 
domestic serfs l
oyal to him that
 the peasant Ka
"rp, who possesse"
d great influenc
e in the village
 commune and had
 recently been 
away driving a g
overnment transp
"ort, had returne"
d with news tha
t the Cossacks w
ere destroying d
eserted villages
", but that the
"
French did not h
arm them. Alpát
ych also knew th
at on the previo
us day another 
peasant had even
 brought from th
e village of Vis
"loúkhovo, which"
 was occupied b
"y the French, a "
proclamation by 
a French general
 that no harm w
ould be done to 
"the inhabitants,"
 and if they rem
ained they would
 be paid for an
ything taken fro
m them. As proof
 of this the pea
sant had brough
t from Visloúkh
ovo a hundred ru
bles in notes (h
e did not know t
hat they were f
alse) paid to hi
m in advance for
 hay.  More im
"portant still, A"
lpátych learned
 that on the mor
ning of the ver
y day he gave th
e village Elder 
orders to collec
t carts to move 
the princess’
 luggage from Bo
"guchárovo, ther"
e had been a vil
lage meeting at 
 which it had be
en decided not t
o move but to wa
it. Yet there wa
s no time to wa
ste. On the fift
"eenth, the day o"
f the old prince
"’s death,
the"
 Marshal had ins
isted on Princes
s Mary’s leavi
"ng at once, as i"
t was becoming 
dangerous. He ha
d told her that 
after the sixtee
nth he could no
t be responsible
 for what might 
happen. On the e
vening of the da
y the old princ
e died the Marsh
"al went away, pr"
omising to retur
n next day for 
the funeral. But
 this he was una
"ble to do, for h"
e received tidin
gs that the Fre
nch had unexpect
"edly advanced, a"
nd had barely ti
me to remove his
 own family and
 valuables from 
his estate.  F
or some thirty y
ears Boguchárov
o had been manag
ed by the villag
"e Elder,
Dron, "
whom the old pri
nce called by th
e diminutive “
Drónushka.” 
 Dron was one o
f those physical
ly and mentally 
vigorous peasant
s who grow big 
beards as soon a
s they are of ag
e and go on unch
anged till they 
 are sixty or se
"venty, without a"
 gray hair or th
e loss of a toot
"h, as
straight "
and strong at si
xty as at thirty
.  Soon after 
the migration to
 the “warm riv
"ers,” in which"
 he had taken p
art like the res
"t, Dron was made"
 village Elder a
nd overseer of 
"Boguchárovo, an"
d had since fill
ed that post irr
eproachably for 
 twenty-three ye
ars. The peasant
s feared him mor
e than they did 
their master. T
"he masters, both"
 the old prince 
"and the young, a"
nd the steward 
respected him an
d jestingly call
ed him “the Mi
nister.” Durin
g the whole tim
e of his service
 Dron had never 
been drunk or il
"l, never after
"
sleepless nights
 or the hardest 
tasks had he sho
wn the least fat
"igue,
and thoug"
h he could not r
ead he had never
 forgotten a sin
gle money accou
nt or the number
 of quarters of 
flour in any of 
the endless car
tloads he sold f
"or the prince, n"
or a single shoc
k of the whole c
orn crop on any
 single acre of 
the Boguchárovo
 fields.  Alp�
"�tych, arriving "
from the devasta
ted Bald Hills e
"state, sent for "
his Dron on the
 day of the prin
ce’s funeral a
nd told him to h
ave twelve hors
es got ready for
 the princess’
 carriages and e
ighteen carts fo
r the things to
 be removed from
 Boguchárovo. T
hough the peasan
ts paid quitren
"t, Alpátych tho"
ught no difficul
ty would be made
 about complying
 with this orde
"r, for there wer"
e two hundred an
d thirty househo
lds at work in 
Boguchárovo and
 the peasants we
re well to do. B
ut on hearing th
e order Dron lo
wered his eyes a
nd remained sile
nt. Alpátych na
med certain pea
"sants he knew, f"
rom whom he told
 him to take the
 carts.  Dron 
replied that the
 horses of these
 peasants were a
way carting. Al
pátych named ot
"hers, but they t"
"oo, according to"
" Dron, had no ho"
rses available:
 some horses wer
e carting for th
"e government, ot"
hers were too w
"eak, and others "
had died for wan
t of fodder. It 
seemed that no h
orses could be 
had even for the
" carriages, much"
 less for the ca
rting.  Alpát
ych looked inten
tly at Dron and 
frowned. Just as
 Dron was a mode
l village Elder
", so Alpátych h"
ad not managed t
he prince’s es
tates for twent
y years in vain.
 He was a model 
"steward, possess"
ing in the highe
st degree the f
aculty of divini
ng the needs and
 instincts of th
ose he dealt wi
th. Having glanc
ed at Dron he at
 once understood
 that his answer
s did not expre
ss his personal 
views but the ge
neral mood of th
e Boguchárovo 
"commune, by whic"
h the Elder had 
already been car
ried away. But h
e also knew tha
"t Dron, who had "
acquired propert
y and was hated 
"by the commune,"
 must be hesitat
ing between the 
two camps: the m
asters’ and th
e serfs’. He 
noticed this hes
itation in Dron�
��s look and the
refore frowned a
nd moved closer
 up to him.  �
��Now just liste
"n, Drónushka,�"
� said he. “Do
n’t talk nonse
nse to me. His 
excellency Princ
e Andrew himself
 gave me orders 
to move all the 
people away and
 not leave them 
"with the enemy, "
and there is an 
order from the 
Tsar about it to
o. Anyone who st
ays is a traitor
 to the Tsar. Do
 you hear?” 
"
“I hear,” "
Dron answered wi
thout lifting hi
s eyes.  Alpá
tych was not sat
isfied with this
 reply.  “Eh
", Dron, it will "
turn out badly!�
"�� he said, shak"
ing his head.  
 “The power is
" in your hands,�"
�� Dron rejoined
 sadly.  “Eh
", Dron, drop it!"
” Alpátych re
"peated, withdraw"
ing his hand fro
m his bosom and
 solemnly pointi
ng to the floor 
at Dron’s feet
. “I can see 
through you and 
three yards into
 the ground unde
"r you,” he con"
"tinued,
gazing "
at the floor in 
front of Dron. 
 Dron was disco
"ncerted, glanced"
 furtively at Al
pátych and agai
n lowered his e
yes.  “You d
rop this nonsens
e and tell the p
eople to get rea
dy to leave thei
r homes and go 
to Moscow and to
 get carts ready
 for tomorrow mo
rning for the p
rincess’ thing
s. And don’t g
o to any meeting
" yourself, do yo"
u hear?”  D
ron suddenly fel
l on his knees. 
  “Yákov Alp
"átych, discharg"
e me! Take the k
eys from me and 
"discharge me,
f"
or Christ’s sa
ke!”  “Sto
p that!” cried
 Alpátych stern
ly. “I see thr
ough you and thr
ee yards under 
"you,” he repea"
"ted, knowing tha"
t his skill in b
"eekeeping, his
"
knowledge of the
 right time to s
"ow the oats, and"
 the fact that h
e had been able
 to retain the o
ld prince’s fa
vor for twenty y
ears had long s
ince gained him 
the reputation o
f being a wizard
", and that the p"
ower of seeing 
three yards unde
r a man is consi
dered an attribu
te of wizards. 
 Dron got up an
d was about to s
"ay something, bu"
t Alpátych inte
rrupted him.  
 “What is it y
ou have got into
" your heads, eh?"
... What are you
" thinking
of, e"
h?”  “What
 am I to do with
 the people?” 
said Dron. “Th
ey’re quite be
side themselves
; I have already
 told them...”
  “‘Told t
"hem,’ I dare s"
ay!” said Alp�
�tych. “Are th
ey drinking?” 
he asked abrupt
ly.  “Quite 
beside themselve
"s, Yákov Alpát"
ych; they’ve f
etched another 
barrel.”  �
"�Well, then, lis"
ten! I’ll go t
o the police off
"icer, and you te"
"ll them
so, and"
 that they must 
stop this and th
e carts must be 
got ready.”  
 “I understand
.”  Alpátyc
h did not insist
 further. He had
 managed people 
for a long time 
 and knew that t
he chief way to 
make them obey i
s to show no sus
picion that the
y can possibly d
isobey. Having w
rung a submissiv
e “I understan
"d”
from Dron,"
 Alpátych conte
nted himself wit
"h that, though h"
e not only doub
ted but felt alm
ost certain that
 without the hel
p of troops the 
 carts would not
 be forthcoming.
  And so it wa
"s, for when even"
ing came no cart
s had been provi
ded. In the vil
"lage, outside th"
"e drink shop, an"
other meeting wa
"s being held, wh"
ich decided tha
t the horses sho
uld be driven ou
t into the woods
 and the carts 
should not be pr
ovided. Without 
saying anything 
of this to the 
"princess, Alpát"
ych had his own 
belongings taken
 out of the cart
s which had arr
ived from Bald H
ills and had tho
se horses got re
ady for the pri
ncess’ carriag
es. Meanwhile he
 went himself to
 the police aut
horities.    
   CHAPTER X 
 After her fath
er’s funeral P
rincess Mary shu
t herself up in 
her room and di
d not admit anyo
ne. A maid came 
to the door to s
ay that Alpátyc
h was asking fo
r orders about t
heir departure. 
(This was before
 his talk with 
Dron.) Princess 
Mary raised hers
elf on the sofa 
on which she had
 been lying and
 replied through
 the closed door
 that she did no
t mean to go aw
ay and begged to
 be left in peac
e.  The window
s of the room in
 which she was l
ying looked west
ward. She lay o
n the sofa with 
her face to the 
"wall, fingering "
the buttons of t
he leather cush
ion and seeing n
othing but that 
"cushion, and her"
 confused thoug
hts were centere
d on one subject
—the irrevocab
ility of death a
nd her own spir
"itual baseness, "
which she had no
"t suspected, but"
 which had show
n itself during 
her father’s i
llness. She wish
ed to pray but d
"id not
dare to,"
 dared not in he
r present state 
of mind address 
herself to God. 
 She lay for a l
ong time in that
 position.  Th
e sun had reache
d the other side
" of the house, a"
nd its slanting 
rays shone into
 the open window
", lighting up th"
e room and part 
of the morocco 
cushion at which
 Princess Mary w
as looking. The 
flow of her thou
ghts suddenly s
topped. Unconsci
ously she sat up
", smoothed her h"
"air, got up,
an"
d went to the wi
"ndow, involuntar"
ily inhaling the
 freshness of th
e clear but win
dy evening.  �
"��Yes, you can w"
ell enjoy the ev
ening now! He is
 gone and no one
 will hinder yo
"u,” she said t"
"o herself, and s"
inking into a ch
air she let her 
 head fall on th
e window sill. 
 Someone spoke 
her name in a so
ft and tender vo
ice from the gar
den and kissed 
her head. She lo
oked up. It was 
Mademoiselle Bou
rienne in a blac
k dress and wee
pers. She softly
 approached Prin
"cess Mary, sighe"
"d, kissed
her, "
and immediately 
began to cry. Th
e princess looke
d up at her. All
 their former d
isharmony and he
r own jealousy r
ecurred to her m
ind. But she re
membered too how
 he had changed 
of late toward M
ademoiselle Bou
rienne and could
 not bear to see
" her, thereby sh"
owing how unjust
 were the repro
aches Princess M
ary had mentally
 addressed to he
"r. “Besides,
"
"is it for me, fo"
r me who desired
" his death, to c"
ondemn anyone?�
� she thought. 
  Princess Mary
 vividly picture
d to herself the
 position of Mad
emoiselle Bouri
"enne, whom she h"
ad of late kept 
"at a distance, b"
ut who yet was 
dependent on her
 and living in h
er house. She fe
lt sorry for her
 and held out h
er hand with a g
lance of gentle 
inquiry. Mademoi
selle Bourienne
 at once began c
rying again and 
kissed that hand
", speaking of
t"
he princess’ s
orrow and making
 herself a partn
er in it. She sa
id her only con
solation was the
 fact that the p
rincess allowed 
her to share her
"
sorrow, that a"
ll the old misun
derstandings sho
uld sink into no
thing but this 
great grief; tha
t she felt herse
lf blameless in 
regard to everyo
"ne,
and that he"
", from above, sa"
w her affection 
and gratitude. T
he princess hea
"rd her, not heed"
ing her words bu
t occasionally l
ooking up at her
 and listening 
to the sound of 
her voice.  �
�Your position i
s doubly terribl
"e, dear princess"
",” said Mademo"
iselle Bourienn
e after a pause.
 “I understand
 that you could 
"not, and cannot,"
 think of yours
"elf, but with my"
 love for you I 
must do so.... H
as Alpátych be
en to you? Has h
e spoken to you 
of going away?�
� she asked.  
Princess Mary di
d not answer. Sh
e did not unders
tand who was to 
go or where to.
 “Is it possib
le to plan or th
ink of anything 
now? Is it not 
all the same?”
" she thought, an"
d did not reply.
"

“You know,"
" chère Marie,�"
� said Mademoise
"lle Bourienne, �"
��that we are in
 danger—are s
urrounded by the
 French. It woul
d be dangerous t
o move now. If 
we go we are alm
ost sure to be t
"aken prisoners, "
and God knows...
”  Princess 
Mary looked at h
er companion wit
hout understandi
ng what she was 
 talking about. 
"

“Oh, if any"
one knew how lit
tle anything mat
"ters to me now,�"
�� she said. �
�Of course I wou
ld on no account
 wish to go away
 from him.... Al
pátych did say
 something about
 going.... Speak
 to him; I can d
"o nothing,
noth"
"ing, and don’t"
 want to....” 
  “I’ve spo
ken to him. He h
opes we should b
e in time to get
" away tomorrow,"
 but I think it 
would now be bet
ter to stay here
",” said Mademo"
iselle Bourienn
"e. “Because, y"
"ou will agree, c"
"hère Marie, to "
fall into the ha
nds of the sold
iers or of rioto
us peasants woul
d be terrible.�
�  Mademoisell
e Bourienne took
 from her reticu
le a proclamatio
n (not printed 
on ordinary Russ
ian paper) of Ge
neral Rameau’s
", telling people"
 not to leave t
heir homes and t
hat the French a
uthorities would
 afford them pr
oper protection.
 She handed this
 to the princess
.  “I think 
it would be best
 to appeal to th
"at general,” s"
"he continued,
�"
��and I am sure 
that all due res
pect would be sh
own you.”  P
rincess Mary rea
"d the paper, and"
 her face began 
to quiver with s
tifled sobs.  
 “From whom di
d you get this?�
�� she asked.  
 “They probabl
y recognized tha
"t I am French, b"
"y my name,” re"
plied Mademoise
lle Bourienne bl
ushing.  Princ
"ess Mary, with t"
he paper in her 
"hand, rose from "
the window and w
ith a pale face
 went out of the
 room and into w
hat had been Pri
nce Andrew’s 
study.  “Dun
"yásha, send Alp"
"átych, or Drón"
"ushka, or somebo"
dy to me!” she
" said,
“and t"
ell Mademoiselle
 Bourienne not t
"o come to me,”"
" she added, hear"
ing Mademoisell
e Bourienne’s 
voice. “We mus
"t go at once, at"
 once!” she sa
"id,
appalled at"
 the thought of 
being left in th
e hands of the F
rench.  “If 
Prince Andrew he
ard that I was i
n the power of t

"
I, the daughter"
 of Prince Nicho

asked General Ra

This idea horrif

"r

 Involuntarily s

with a deep bow 
 to Princess Mar

 by the doorpost
.  Princess Ma

"��Drónushka,”"
" she said, regar"

 “We are all i

"” said he, wit"
h a sigh.  The
y were silent fo
r a while.  �
"�Drónushka, Alp"
átych has gone 
off somewhere an
d I have no one 
to turn to. Is 
"it true, as they"
" tell me, that I"
 can’t even go
 away?”  “
Why shouldn’t 
"you go away, you"
r excellency? Yo
"u can go,” sai"
d Dron.  “I 
was told it woul

ecause of the en

��  Dron pause
d. He looked ask
ance at Princess
 Mary and said: 
“There are no 
 horses; I told 
Yákov Alpátych
 so.”  “Wh
y are there none
?” asked the p
rincess.  “I
t’s all God’
"s scourge,” sa"
id Dron. “What
 horses we had h
ave been taken 
for the army or 
have died—this
 is such a year!
 It’s not a ca
se of feeding h
orses—we may d
ie of hunger our
selves! As it is
", some go three"
 days without ea
ting. We’ve no
"thing, we’ve b"
een ruined.” 
 Princess Mary 
listened attenti
vely to what he 
told her.  “
The peasants are
 ruined? They ha
ve no bread?” 
she asked.  �
�They’re dying
" of hunger,” s"
aid Dron. “It�
��s not a case o
f carting.”  
 “But why didn
’t you tell me
", Drónushka? Is"
n’t it possibl
e to help them? 
 I’ll do all I
 can....”  T
o Princess Mary 
it was strange t
"hat now, at a mo"
ment when such s
orrow was filli
"ng her soul, the"
re could be rich
 people and poor
", and the rich
"
could refrain fr
om helping the p
oor. She had hea
rd vaguely that 
there was such 
a thing as “la
ndlord’s corn�
�� which was som
etimes given to 
the peasants. S
he also knew tha
t neither her fa
ther nor her bro
ther would refu
se to help the p
"easants in need,"
 she only feared
 to make some m
istake in speaki
ng about the dis
tribution of the
 grain she wishe
d to give. She 
was glad such ca
res presented th
"emselves, enabli"
ng her without 
scruple to forge
t her own grief.
 She began askin
g Dron about the
 peasants’ ne
eds and what the
re was in Boguch
árovo that belo
nged to the lan
dlord.  “But
 we have grain b
elonging to my b
rother?” she s
aid.  “The l
andlord’s grai
"n is all safe,�"
� replied Dron p
roudly. “Our p
rince did not o
rder it to be so
ld.”  “Giv
e it to the peas
"ants, let them h"
ave all they nee
d; I give you le
ave in my broth
"er’s name,” "
said she.  Dro
n made no answer
 but sighed deep
ly.  “Give t
hem that corn if
 there is enough
 of it. Distribu
te it all. I gi
ve this order in
 my brother’s 
name; and tell t
hem that what is
 ours is theirs
. We do not grud
ge them anything
. Tell them so.�
��  Dron looke
d intently at th
e princess while
 she was speakin
g.  “Dischar
"ge me, little mo"
"ther, for God’"
s sake! Order th
e keys to be tak
"en
from me,” "
said he. “I ha
ve served twenty
-three years and
 have done no w
rong. Discharge 
"me, for God’s "
sake!”  Prin
cess Mary did no
t understand wha
t he wanted of h
er or why he was
 asking to be d
ischarged. She r
eplied that she 
had never doubte
d his devotion 
and that she was
 ready to do any
thing for him an
d for the peasa
nts.      
CHAPTER XI  An
 hour later Duny
ásha came to te
ll the princess 
that Dron had co
"me, and
all the"
 peasants had as
sembled at the b
arn by the princ
ess’ order and
 wished to have
 word with their
 mistress.  �
�But I never tol
"d them to come,�"
�� said Princess
 Mary. “I only
 told Dron to l
et them have the
 grain.”  �
"�Only, for God�"
"�s sake, Princes"
"s dear, have the"
m sent away and 
don’t go out 
to them. It’s 
"all a trick,” "
"said Dunyásha, "
“and when Yák
ov Alpátych re
turns let us get
 away... and ple
ase don’t...�
�  “What is 
a trick?” aske
d Princess Mary 
in surprise.  
"“I know it is,"
 only listen to 
me for God’s s
ake! Ask nurse t
oo. They say th
ey don’t agree
 to leave Boguch
árovo as you or
dered.”  “
You’re making 
some mistake. I 
never ordered th
"em to go away,�"
� said Princess
 Mary. “Call D
rónushka.”  
 Dron came and c
onfirmed Dunyás
ha’s words; th
e peasants had c
ome by the prin
cess’ order. 
 “But I never
" sent for them,�"
�� declared the 
princess. “You
 must have given
 my message wro
ng. I only said 
that you were to
 give them the g
rain.”  Dron
 only sighed in 
reply.  “If 
you order it the
"y will go away,�"
�� said he.  �
"��No, no. I’ll"
" go out to them,"
” said Princes
"s Mary, and in s"
pite of the nur
se’s and Duny�
�sha’s protest
s she went out i
nto the porch; D
"ron,
Dunyásha,"
" the nurse, and "
Michael Ivánovi
ch following her
.  “They pro
bably think I am
 offering them t
he grain to brib
e them to remai
"n here, while I "
myself go away l
eaving them to t
he mercy of the 
"
French,” thou"
ght Princess Mar
y. “I will off
er them monthly 
rations and hou
sing at our Mosc
ow estate. I am 
sure Andrew woul
d do even more i
"n
my place,” "
she thought as s
he went out in t
he twilight towa
rd the crowd st
anding on the pa
sture by the bar
n.  The men cr
owded closer tog
"ether, stirred, "
and rapidly took
 off their hats
. Princess Mary 
lowered her eyes
" and, tripping o"
"ver her skirt, c"
ame close up to
 them. So many d
"ifferent eyes, o"
"ld and young, we"
re fixed on her
", and there were"
 so many differe
"nt faces, that s"
he could not di
stinguish any of
" them and, feeli"
ng that she must
 speak to them a
"ll
at once, did"
 not know how to
 do it. But agai
n the sense that
 she represente
d her father and
 her brother gav
"e her courage, a"
nd she boldly b
egan her speech.
  “I am very
 glad you have c
"ome,” she said"
 without raising
" her eyes, and
"
feeling her hear
t beating quickl
y and violently.
 “Drónushka t
ells me that th
e war has ruined
 you. That is ou
r common misfort
"une, and I
shal"
l grudge nothing
 to help you. I 
am myself going 
away because it 
 is dangerous he
re... the enemy 
is near... becau
se... I am givin
g you everythin
"g, my friends, a"
nd I beg you to 
"take everything,"
" all our grain,"
 so that you may
 not suffer want
! And if you hav
e been told that
 I am giving yo
u the grain to k
eep you here—t
hat is not true.
 On the contrary
",
I ask you to "
go with all your
 belongings to o
ur estate near M
"oscow, and
I pr"
omise you I will
 see to it that 
there you shall 
want for nothing
. You shall be 
given food and l
odging.”  Th
e princess stopp
ed. Sighs were t
he only sound he
ard in the crowd
.  “I am not
 doing this on m
"y own account,�"
"� she continued,"
 “I do it in t
he name of my d
"ead father, who "
was a good maste
"r to you, and of"
 my brother and
 his son.”  
Again she paused
. No one broke t
he silence.  �
��Ours is a comm
on misfortune an
d we will share 
it together. All
 that is mine i
"s yours,” she "
"concluded, scann"
ing the faces be
fore her.  All
 eyes were gazin
g at her with on
e and the same e
xpression. She 
could not fathom
 whether it was 
"curiosity, devot"
"ion, gratitude, "
or apprehension
 and distrust—
but the expressi
on on all the fa
ces was identic
al.  “We are
 all very thankf
ul for your boun
"ty, but it won�"
�t do for us to 
 take the landlo
"rd’s grain,”"
 said a voice at
 the back of the
 crowd.  “Bu
t why not?” as
ked the princess
.  No one repl
ied and Princess
" Mary, looking r"
ound at the crow
"d, found that
e"
very eye she met
 now was immedia
tely dropped.  
 “But why don�
��t you want to 
take it?” she 
asked again.  
No one answered.
  The silence 
began to oppress
 the princess an
d she tried to c
atch someone’
s eye.  “Why
 don’t you spe
ak?” she inqui
red of a very ol
d man who stood 
just in front o
f her leaning on
 his stick. “I
f you think some
thing more is w
"anted, tell me! "
I will do anythi
"ng,” said she,"
 catching his ey
e.  But as if 
this angered him
", he bent his he"
ad quite low and
 muttered:  �
�Why should we a
gree? We don’t
 want the grain.
”  “Why sh
ould we give up 
everything? We d
on’t agree. Do
n’t agree.... 
We are sorry fo
"r you, but we’"
re not willing. 
Go away yourself
", alone...”
c"
ame from various
 sides of the cr
owd.  And agai
n all the faces 
in that crowd bo
re an identical 
"expression,
tho"
ugh now it was c
ertainly not an 
expression of cu
riosity or grati
"tude,
but of an"
gry resolve.  
“But you can�
�t have understo
"od me,” said P"
rincess Mary wit
h a sad smile. 
“Why don’t y
ou want to go? I
 promise to hous
"e and feed you, "
while here the 
enemy would ruin
 you....”  B
ut her voice was
 drowned by the 
voices of the cr
owd.  “We’
re not willing. 
Let them ruin us
! We won’t tak
e your grain. We
 don’t agree.
”  Again Pri
ncess Mary tried
 to catch someon
"e’s eye, but n"
ot a single eye 
 in the crowd wa
s turned to her;
 evidently they 
were all trying 
to avoid her lo
ok. She felt str
ange and awkward
".

“Oh yes, "
an artful tale! 
Follow her into 
slavery! Pull do
wn your houses 
and go into bond
age! I dare say!
 ‘I’ll give 
"you grain, indee"
"d!’ she
says,"
” voices in th
e crowd were hea
rd saying.  Wi
th drooping head
 Princess Mary l
eft the crowd an
d went back to t
he house. Havin
g repeated her o
rder to Dron to 
have horses read
y for her depar
ture next mornin
"g, she went to h"
er room and rema
ined alone with 
her own thought
s.      CH
APTER XII  For
 a long time tha
t night Princess
 Mary sat by the
 open window of 
her room hearin
g the sound of t
he peasants’ v
oices that reach
ed her from the
" village, but it"
 was not of them
 she was thinkin
g. She felt that
 she could not 
understand them 
however much she
 might think abo
ut them. She th
ought only of on
"e thing, her sor"
"row, which, afte"
r the break caus
ed by cares for
" the present, se"
emed already to 
belong to the pa
st. Now she cou
ld remember it a
nd weep or pray.
  After sunset
 the wind had dr
opped. The night
 was calm and fr
esh. Toward mid
night the voices
 began to subsid
"e, a cock crowed"
", the full moon "
began to show f
rom behind the l
"ime trees, a fre"
sh white dewy mi
st began to ris
"e, and stillness"
 reigned over th
e village and th
e house.  Pict
ures of the near
 past—her fath
er’s illness a
nd last moments�
��rose one afte
r another to her
 memory. With mo
urnful pleasure 
she now lingered
 over these ima
"ges, repelling w"
ith horror only 
"the last one, th"
e picture of hi
"s death, which s"
he felt she coul
d not contemplat
e even in imagi
nation at this s
till and mystic 
hour of night. A
nd these picture
s presented the
mselves to her s
o clearly and in
 such detail tha
t they seemed n
"ow present, now "
"past, and now fu"
ture.  She viv
idly recalled th
e moment when he
 had his first s
troke and was b
eing dragged alo
ng by his armpit
s through the ga
rden at Bald Hil
"ls,
muttering s"
omething with hi
s helpless tongu
"e, twitching his"
 gray eyebrows 
and looking unea
sily and timidly
 at her.  “E
ven then he want
ed to tell me wh
at he told me th
"e day he died,�"
� she thought. 
“He had always
 thought what he
 said then.” A
nd she recalled 
in all its deta
il the night at 
Bald Hills befor
e he had the las
"t stroke,
when "
with a forebodin
g of disaster sh
e had remained a
t home against h
is will. She ha
d not slept and 
had stolen downs
"tairs on tiptoe,"
 and going to t
he door of the c
onservatory wher
e he slept that 
night had listen
ed at the door.
 In a suffering 
and weary voice 
he was saying so
mething to Tík
"hon, speaking of"
 the Crimea and 
its warm nights 
and of the Empre
ss. Evidently h
e had wanted to 
talk. “And why
 didn’t he cal
l me? Why didn�
�t he let me be
 there instead o
f Tíkhon?” Pr
incess Mary had 
thought and tho
ught again now. 
“Now he will n
ever tell anyone
 what he had in 
his soul. Never
 will that momen
t return for him
 or for me when 
he might have s
aid all he longe
"d to say, and no"
t Tíkhon but I 
might have heard
 and understood
 him. Why didn�
�t I enter the r
oom?” she thou
ght. “Perhaps 
he would then h
ave said to me w
hat he said the 
day he died. Whi
le talking to T
íkhon he asked 
about me twice. 
He wanted to see
" me, and I was
"
standing close b
"y, outside the d"
oor. It was sad 
and painful for 
him to talk to 
Tíkhon who did 
not understand h
im. I remember h
ow he began spe
aking to him abo
ut Lise as if sh
e were alive—h
e had forgotten 
she was dead—
and Tíkhon remi
nded him that sh
"e was no more, a"
"nd he shouted,
"
‘Fool!’ He w
as greatly depre
ssed. From behin
d the door I hea
rd how he lay d
own on his bed g
roaning and loud
"ly exclaimed, �"
�My God!’ Why 
didn’t I go i
n then? What cou
ld he have done 
to me? What coul
d I have lost? A
nd perhaps he w
ould then have b
een comforted an
d would have sai
d that word to 
me.” And Princ
ess Mary uttered
 aloud the cares
sing word he had
 said to her on
 the day of his 
death. “Dear-e
st!” she repea
"ted, and began
"
"sobbing, with te"
ars that relieve
d her soul. She 
now saw his face
 before her. An
d not the face s
he had known eve
r since she coul
d remember and 
had always seen 
"at a distance, b"
"ut the timid, fe"
eble face she ha
d seen for the 
first time quite
" closely, with a"
ll its wrinkles 
"and details,
wh"
en she stooped n
ear to his mouth
 to catch what h
e said.  “De
ar-est!” she r
epeated again. 
 “What was he
 thinking when h
e uttered that w
ord? What is he 
thinking now?�
� This question 
suddenly present
ed itself to her
", and in answer "
she saw him bef
ore her with the
 expression that
 was on his face
 as he lay in h
is coffin with h
is chin bound up
 with a white ha
ndkerchief. And 
the horror that
 had seized her 
when she touched
 him and convinc
ed herself that
 that was not he
", but something "
mysterious and h
"orrible, seized "
her again. She 
tried to think o
f something else
" and to pray, bu"
t could do neit
her. With wide-o
pen eyes she gaz
ed at the moonli
ght and the shad
"ows,
expecting "
every moment to 
see his dead fac
"e, and she felt "
that the silenc
e brooding over 
the house and wi
thin it held her
 fast.  “Dun
"yásha,” she w"
hispered. “Dun
yásha!” she s
"creamed wildly, "
and tearing her
self out of this
 silence she ran
 to the servants
’ quarters to 
meet her old nu
rse and the maid
servants who cam
e running toward
 her.      
 CHAPTER XIII  
 On the seventee
nth of August Ro
stóv and Ilyín
", accompanied by"
 Lavrúshka who
 had just return
ed from captivit
y and by an huss
"ar orderly, left"
 their quarters
" at Yankóvo, te"
n miles from Bog
"uchárovo, and w"
ent for a ride�
��to try a new h
orse Ilyín had 
bought and to fi
nd out whether t
here was any ha
y to be had in t
he villages.  
For the last thr
ee days Boguchá
rovo had lain be
tween the two ho
"stile
armies, s"
o that it was as
 easy for the Ru
ssian rearguard 
to get to it as 
 for the French 
vanguard; Rostó
"v, as a careful "
squadron command
"er, wished
to t"
ake such provisi
ons as remained 
at Boguchárovo 
before the Frenc
h could get the
m.  Rostóv an
d Ilyín were in
 the merriest of
 moods. On the w
ay to Boguchár
"ovo, a princely "
estate with a dw
elling house and
 farm where the
y hoped to find 
many domestic se
rfs and pretty g
"irls, they quest"
ioned Lavrúshk
a about Napoleon
 and laughed at 
"his stories, and"
 raced one anot
her to try Ilyí
n’s horse.  
Rostóv had no i
dea that the vil
lage he was ente
ring was the pro
perty of that v
ery Bolkónski w
ho had been enga
ged to his siste
r.  Rostóv an
d Ilyín gave re
in to their hors
es for a last ra
ce along the in
cline before rea
ching Bogucháro
"vo, and Rostóv,"
 outstripping Il
"yín, was
the f"
irst to gallop i
nto the village 
street.  “Yo
u’re first!”
" cried Ilyín, f"
lushed.  “Ye
"s, always first "
both on the gras
"sland and here,�"
�� answered Rost
"óv,
stroking h"
is heated Donét
s horse.  “A
nd I’d have wo
"n on my Frenchy,"
 your excellency
",” said Lavrú"
shka from behin
"d, alluding to h"
is shabby cart h
"orse, “only I "
didn’t wish to
 mortify you.�
�  They rode a
t a footpace to 
"the barn, where "
a large crowd of
 peasants was s
tanding.  Some
 of the men bare
"d their heads, o"
thers stared at 
the new arrivals
 without doffin
g their caps. Tw
o tall old peasa
nts with wrinkle
d faces and sca
nty beards emerg
ed from the tave
"rn, smiling, sta"
"ggering, and
si"
nging some incoh
"erent song, and "
approached the o
fficers.  “F
ine fellows!” 
said Rostóv lau
ghing. “Is the
re any hay here?
”  “And ho
w like one anoth
"er,” said Ily�"
�n.  “A mo-o
-st me-r-r-y co-
o-m-pa...!” sa
ng one of the pe
asants with a b
lissful smile. 
 One of the men
 came out of the
 crowd and went 
up to Rostóv. 
 “Who do you 
belong to?” he
 asked.  “Th
"e French,” rep"
lied Ilyín jest
"ingly, “and he"
re is Napoleon 
himself”—and
 he pointed to L

�Then you are Ru

in.  “And is
 there a large f
orce of you here
?” said anothe
"r, a short man,"
 coming up.  �
"��Very large,”"
 answered Rostó
v. “But why ha
ve you collected
 here?” he ad
ded. “Is it a 
holiday?”  �
��The old men ha
ve met to talk o
ver the business

” replied the
" peasant, moving"
 away.  At tha
"t moment, on the"
 road leading fr
om the big house
", two women and "
a man in a whit
e hat were seen 
coming toward th
e officers.  �
��The one in pin
"k is mine, so ke"
ep off!” said 
Ilyín on seeing
 Dunyásha runn
ing resolutely t
oward him.  �
�She’ll be our
s!” said Lavr�
"�shka to Ilyín,"
 winking.  “
What do you want
", my pretty?” "
said Ilyín with
 a smile.  “
The princess ord
ered me to ask y
our regiment and
 your name.” 
 “This is Cou
"nt Rostóv, squa"
"dron commander, "
and I am your hu
mble servant.�
�  “Co-o-om-
pa-ny!” roared
 the tipsy peasa
nt with a beatif
ic smile as he 
looked at Ilyín
 talking to the 
girl. Following 
"Dunyásha, Alpá"
tych advanced t
"o Rostóv, havin"
g bared his head
 while still at 
a distance.  �
��May I make bol
d to trouble you
r honor?” said
 he respectfully
", but with
a sh"
ade of contempt 
for the youthful
ness of this off
icer and with a 
hand thrust int
o his bosom. “
"My mistress, dau"
ghter of General
 in Chief Prince
 Nicholas Bolk�

n the fifteenth 
"of this month, f"
inding herself 
in difficulties 
owing to the boo

 pointed to the
 peasants—“a
sks you to come 
up to the house.
... Won’t you
", please, ride o"
n a little farth

�tych with a mel
"ancholy
smile, "
“as it is not 
convenient in th
e presence of...
?” He pointed 
to the two peas
ants who kept as
 close to him as
 horseflies to a
 horse.  “Ah
!... Alpátych..
". Ah, Yákov Alp"
átych... Grand!
 Forgive us for 
Christ’s sake
", eh?” said th"
"e peasants, smil"
ing joyfully at 
him.  Rostóv 
looked at the ti
psy peasants and
 smiled.  “O
r perhaps they a
muse your honor?
” remarked Alp
átych with a st
"aid air,
as he "
pointed at the o
ld men with his 
free hand.  �
"�No, there’s n"
ot much to be am
"used at here,”"
" said Rostóv, a"
nd rode on a li
ttle way. “Wha
t’s the matter
?” he asked. 
 “I make bold
 to inform your 
honor that the r
ude peasants her
e don’t wish 
to let the mistr
ess leave the es
"tate, and threat"
en to unharness 
"her
horses, so "
that though ever
ything has been 
packed up since 
"morning, her
ex"
cellency cannot 
get away.”  
“Impossible!�
� exclaimed Rost
óv.  “I hav
e the honor to r
eport to you the
" actual truth,�"
� said Alpátych
.  Rostóv dis
"mounted, gave hi"
s horse to the o
"rderly, and foll"
owed Alpátych 
"to the house, qu"
estioning him as
 to the state of
 affairs. It app
eared that the 
princess’ offe
r of corn to the
 peasants the pr
"evious day, and"
 her talk with D
ron and at the m
"eeting, had actu"
ally had so bad 
an effect that 
Dron had finally
 given up the ke
ys and joined th
e peasants and h
ad not appeared
 when Alpátych 
sent for him; an
d that in the mo
rning when the 
princess gave or
ders to harness 
"for her journey,"
 the peasants ha
d come in a lar
ge crowd to the 
barn and sent wo
rd that they wou
ld not let her 
leave the villag
e: that there wa
s an order not t
"o move, and that"
 they would unh
arness the horse
s. Alpátych had
 gone out to adm
"onish them,
but"
 was told (it wa
s chiefly Karp w
ho did the talki
"ng, Dron not sho"
wing himself in
 the crowd) that
 they could not 
let the princess
" go, that
there"
 was an order to
" the contrary, b"
ut that if she s
tayed they would
 serve her as b
efore and obey h
er in everything
.  At the mome
nt when Rostóv 
and Ilyín were 
galloping along 
"the road,
Princ"
"ess Mary, despit"
e the dissuasion
"s of Alpátych, "
"her nurse, and t"

"an
away, and th"
e women in the h
ouse began to wa
il.  “Father
! Benefactor! Go
d has sent you!�
�� exclaimed dee
ply moved voices
 as Rostóv pas
sed through the 
anteroom.  Pri
ncess Mary was s
itting helpless 
and bewildered i
n the large sitt
"ing
room, when "
Rostóv was show
n in. She could 
not grasp who he
 was and why he
" had come, or wh"
at was happening
 to her. When sh
e saw his Russia
"n
face, and by "
his walk and the
 first words he 
uttered recogniz
ed him as a man
 of her own clas
"s, she glanced a"
t him with her d
eep radiant look
 and began spea
king in a voice 
that faltered an
d trembled with 
emotion. This m
eeting immediate
ly struck Rostó
v as a romantic 
event. “A help
less girl overw
helmed with grie
"f, left to the m"
"ercy of coarse, "
rioting peasants
! And what a st
range fate sent 
me here! What ge
ntleness and nob
ility there are
 in her features
 and expression!
” thought he a
s he looked at h
er and listened
 to her timid st
ory.  When she
 began to tell h
im that all this
 had happened th
e day after her 
 father’s fune
"ral, her voice t"
rembled. She tur
"ned away, and th"
"en, as if
feari"
ng he might take
 her words as me
ant to move him 
"to pity, looked "
at him with an 
apprehensive gla
nce of inquiry. 
There were tears
 in Rostóv’s 
 eyes. Princess 
Mary noticed thi
s and glanced gr
atefully at him 
with that radia
nt look which ca
used the plainne
ss of her face t
o be forgotten. 
  “I cannot e
"xpress, Princess"
", how glad I am "
that I happened 
to ride here an
d am able to sho
w my readiness t
"o serve you,” "
"said Rostóv, ri"
sing. “Go whe
"n you please, an"
d I give you my 
word of honor th
at no one shall 
dare to cause y
ou annoyance if 
only you will al
low me to act as
 your escort.”
 And bowing res
"pectfully, as if"
 to a lady of ro
"yal blood, he mo"
ved toward the 
door.  Rostóv
’s deferential
 tone seemed to 
indicate that th
ough he would c
onsider himself 
happy to be acqu
"ainted with her,"
 he did not wish
 to take advant
age of her misfo
rtunes to intrud
e upon her.  P
rincess Mary und
erstood this and
 appreciated his
 delicacy.  �
"�I am very, very"
 grateful to you
",” she said in"
" French, “but "
I hope it was a
ll a misundersta
nding and that n
o one is to blam
e for it.” She
 suddenly began
 to cry.  “E
xcuse me!” she
 said.  Rostó
"v, knitting his "
"brows, left the "
room with anothe
r low bow.   
   CHAPTER XI
"V

“Well, is"
" she pretty? Ah,"
 friend—my pin
k one is delicio
us; her name is 
 Dunyásha....�
�  But on glan
cing at Rostóv�
��s face Ilyín 
stopped short. H
e saw that his 
hero and command
er was following
 quite a differe
nt train of thou
ght.  Rostóv 
glanced angrily 
at Ilyín and wi
thout replying s
trode off with 
rapid steps to t
he village.  �
��I’ll show th
em; I’ll give 
"it to them, the "
brigands!” sai
d he to himself
.  Alpátych a
t a gliding trot
", only just mana"
"ging not to run,"
 kept up with h
im with difficul
ty.  “What d
ecision have you
 been pleased to
 come to?” sai
d he.  Rostóv
" stopped and, cl"
enching his fist
"s, suddenly and "
sternly turned o
n Alpátych.  
 “Decision? Wh
at decision? Old
 dotard!...” c
ried he. “What
 have you been 
about? Eh? The p
easants are riot
"ing, and you can"
’t manage them
? You’re a tr
aitor yourself! 
I know you. I’
ll flay you all 
alive!...” And
 as if afraid o
f wasting his st
"ore of anger, he"
 left Alpátych 
and went rapidly
 forward. Alpá
"tych, mastering "
his offended fee
"lings, kept pace"
 with Rostóv a
t a gliding gait
 and continued t
o impart his vie
ws. He said the
 peasants were o
bdurate and that
 at the present 
moment it would 
be imprudent to
 “overresist�
� them without a
"n armed force, a"
nd would it not 
 be better first
 to send for the
 military?  �
�I’ll give the
m armed force...
 I’ll ‘overr
esist’ them!�
� uttered Rostó
v meaninglessly
", breathless wit"
h irrational ani
mal fury and the
 need to vent i
t.  Without co
nsidering what h
e would do he mo
ved unconciously
" with quick,
re"
solute steps tow
ard the crowd. A
nd the nearer he
 drew to it the 
more Alpátych 
felt that this u
nreasonable acti
on might produce
 good results. 
The peasants in 
the crowd were s
imilarly impress
ed when they saw
 Rostóv’s ra
"pid, firm steps "
"and resolute, fr"
owning face.  
After the hussar
s had come to th
e village and Ro
stóv had gone t
o see the princ
"ess, a certain c"
onfusion and dis
sension had aris
en among the cro
wd. Some of the
 peasants said t
hat these new ar
rivals were Russ
ians and might 
take it amiss th
at the mistress 
was being detain
ed. Dron was of 
"
this opinion, b"
ut as soon as he
 expressed it Ka
rp and others at
tacked their ex
-Elder.  “Ho
w many years hav
e you been fatte
ning on the comm
une?” Karp sho
uted at him. �
�It’s all one 
to you! You’ll
 dig up your pot
 of money and ta
ke it away with
 you.... What do
es it matter to 
you whether our 
homes are ruine
d or not?”  
“We’ve been 
told to keep ord
"er, and that no "
one is to leave 
their homes or 
take away a sing
"le grain, and th"
at’s all about
 it!” cried an
other.  “It 
was your son’s
 turn to be cons
"cripted, but no "
fear! You begrud
ged your lump o
"f a son,” a li"
ttle old man sud
denly began atta
cking Dron—“
and so they too
k my Vánka to b
e shaved for a s
oldier! But we a
ll have to die.
”  “To be 
"sure, we all hav"
e to die. I’m 
not against the 
"commune,” said"
 Dron.  “Th
at’s it—not 
against it! You�
��ve filled your
 belly....”  
 The two tall pe
asants had their
 say. As soon as
" Rostóv, follow"
"ed by
Ilyín, L"
"avrúshka, and A"
"lpátych, came u"
"p to the crowd, "
"Karp, thrusting"
 his fingers int
o his belt and s
"miling a little,"
 walked to the f
ront. Dron on t
he contrary reti
red to the rear 
and the crowd dr
ew closer toget
her.  “Who i
s your Elder her
e? Hey?” shout
"ed Rostóv, comi"
ng up to the cro
wd with quick s
teps.  “The 
Elder? What do y
ou want with him
?...” asked Ka
rp.  But befor
e the words were
 well out of his
" mouth, his cap "
flew off and a 
fierce blow jerk
ed his head to o
ne side.  “C
"aps off, traitor"
s!” shouted Ro
stóv in a wrath
ful voice. “Wh
ere’s the Eld
er?” he cried 
furiously.  �
�The Elder.... H
e wants the Elde
r!... Dron Zakh�
"�rych, you!” m"
eek and fluster
ed voices here a
nd there were he
ard calling and 
caps began to c
ome off their he
ads.  “We do
"n’t riot, we�"
�re following th
"e orders,” dec"
"lared Karp, and "
at that moment 
several voices b
egan speaking to
gether.  “It
’s as the old 
men have decided
—there’s too
 many of you giv
ing orders.” 
  “Arguing? M
utiny!... Brigan
ds! Traitors!”
 cried Rostóv u
nmeaningly in a 
 voice not his o
"wn, gripping Kar"
p by the collar.
" “Bind him, bi"
nd him!” he s
"houted, though t"
here was no one 
to bind him but 
Lavrúshka and A
lpátych.  Lav
"rúshka, however"
", ran up to Karp"
 and seized him 
by the arms from
 behind.  “
Shall I call up 
our men from bey
ond the hill?”
 he called out. 
  Alpátych tur
ned to the peasa
nts and ordered 
two of them by n
ame to come and
 bind Karp. The 
men obediently c
ame out of the c
rowd and began t
aking off their
 belts.  “Wh
ere’s the Elde
r?” demanded R
ostóv in a loud
 voice.  With 
a pale and frown
ing face Dron st
epped out of the
 crowd.  “Ar
e you the Elder?
" Bind him, Lavr�"
�shka!” shoute
"d Rostóv, as if"
" that
order, to"
"o, could not pos"
sibly meet with 
any opposition. 
  And in fact t
wo more peasants
 began binding D
"ron, who took of"
f his own belt 
and handed it to
" them, as if to "
aid them.  “
And you all list
en to me!” sai
d Rostóv to the
 peasants. “Be
 off to your ho
"uses at once, an"
d don’t let on
e of your voices
 be heard!”  
"
“Why, we’ve"
 not done any ha
rm! We did it ju
st out of foolis
hness. It’s a
ll nonsense.... 
I said then that
 it was not in o
"rder,” voices "
were heard bick
ering with one a
nother.  “Th
ere! What did I 
say?” said Alp
"átych, coming i"
nto his own agai
n. “It’s wr
"ong, lads!”
"
 “All our stup
"idity, Yákov Al"
"pátych,” came"
" the answers, an"
d the crowd beg
an at once to di
sperse through t
he village.  T
he two bound men
 were led off to
 the master’s 
house. The two d
runken peasants
 followed them. 
"

“Aye, when "
I look at you!..
.” said one of
 them to Karp. 
 “How can one
 talk to the mas
ters like that? 
What were you th
"inking of,
you "
fool?” added t
he other—“A 
real fool!”  
 Two hours later
 the carts were 
standing in the 
courtyard of the
 Boguchárovo h
ouse. The peasan
ts were briskly 
carrying out the
 proprietor’s
 goods and packi
ng them on the c
"arts, and Dron, "
liberated at Pr
incess Mary’s 
wish from the cu
pboard where he 
had been confine
"d, was
standing"
 in the yard dir
ecting the men. 
  “Don’t pu
t it in so carel
"essly,” said o"
ne of the peasan
"ts, a man with a"
 round smiling 
"face, taking a c"
asket from a hou
semaid. “You k
now it has cost
 money! How can 
you chuck it in 
like that or sho
ve it under the 
cord where it�
�ll get rubbed? 
I don’t like t
hat way of doing
 things. Let it 
 all be done pro
"perly, according"
 to rule. Look h
"ere, put it unde"
r the bast matt
ing and cover it
 with hay—that
’s the way!”
"

“Eh, books"
", books!” said"
 another peasant
", bringing out P"
rince Andrew’s
 library cupboa
rds. “Don’t 
catch up against
 it! It’s heav
"y, lads—solid"
 books.”  �
"�Yes, they worke"
d all day and di
dn’t play!” 
remarked the tal
"l,
round-faced "
"peasant gravely,"
 pointing with a
 significant win
k at the dictio
naries that were
 on the top.  
 Unwilling to o
btrude himself o
"n the princess, "
Rostóv did not 
go back to the 
house but remain
ed in the villag
e awaiting her d
eparture. When h
er carriage dro
ve out of the ho
"use, he mounted "
and accompanied 
her eight miles
 from Bogucháro
vo to where the 
road was occupie
d by our troops.
 At the inn at 
Yankóvo he resp
ectfully took le
"ave of her, for "
the first time 
permitting himse
lf to kiss her h
and.  “How c
an you speak so!
” he blushingl
y replied to Pri
ncess Mary’s 
expressions of g
ratitude for her
" deliverance, as"
 she termed what
 had occurred. 
“Any police of
ficer would have
 done as much! I
f we had had on
ly peasants to f
"ight, we should "
not have let the
 enemy come so f
"ar,”
said he "
with a sense of 
shame and wishin
g to change the 
subject. “I a
m only happy to 
have had the opp
ortunity of maki
ng your acquaint
"ance.
Good-by, "
Princess. I wish
 you happiness a
nd consolation a
nd hope to meet 
 you again in ha
ppier circumstan
ces. If you don�
��t want to make
" me blush,
plea"
se don’t thank
 me!”  But t
"he princess, if "
she did not agai
n thank him in w
"ords, thanked
h"
im with the whol
e expression of 
"her face, radian"
t with gratitude
 and tenderness
. She could not 
believe that the
re was nothing t
o thank him for
. On the contrar
"y, it seemed to "
her certain that
 had he not been
 there she woul
d have perished 
at the hands of 
the mutineers an
d of the French
", and that he ha"
d exposed himsel
f to terrible an
d obvious danger
"
to save her, a"
nd even more cer
tain was it that
 he was a man of
 lofty and nobl
"e soul, able to "
understand her p
osition and her 
sorrow. His kind
",
honest eyes, "
with the tears r
ising in them wh
en she herself h
ad begun to cry
 as she spoke of
" her loss, did n"
ot leave her mem
ory.  When she
 had taken leave
 of him and rema
ined alone she s
uddenly felt he
r eyes filling w
"ith tears, and t"
hen not for the 
first time the s
trange question
 presented itsel
f to her: did sh
e love him?  O
n the rest of th
"e way to Moscow,"
 though the prin
cess’ position
 was not a chee
"rful one, Dunyá"
"sha, who went wi"
th her in the ca
"rriage, more tha"
n once noticed 
that her mistres
s leaned out of 
the window and s
miled at someth
ing with an expr
ession of mingle
d joy and sorrow
".

“Well, su"
pposing I do lov
e him?” though
t Princess Mary.
  Ashamed as s
he was of acknow
ledging to herse
lf that she had 
fallen in love 
with a man who w
ould perhaps nev
"er love her, she"
 comforted herse
lf with the tho
ught that no one
 would ever know
 it and that she
 would not be t
"o blame if, with"
out ever speakin
g of it to anyon
"e, she continued"
 to the end of 
her life to love
 the man with wh
om she had falle
n in love for t
he first and las
t time in her li
fe.  Sometimes
 when she recall
"ed his looks, hi"
"s sympathy, and "
"his words,
happ"
iness did not ap
pear impossible 
to her. It was a
t those moments 
that Dunyásha 
noticed her smil
ing as she looke
d out of the car
riage window.  
 “Was it not f
ate that brought
 him to Boguchá
"rovo, and at tha"
t very moment?�
�� thought Princ
ess Mary. “And
 that caused his
 sister to refus
e my brother?�
� And in all thi
s Princess Mary 
saw the hand of 
Providence.  T
he impression th
e princess made 
on Rostóv was a
 very agreeable 
one. To remembe
r her gave him p
"leasure, and whe"
"n his comrades, "
hearing of his 
adventure at Bog
"uchárovo, ralli"
ed him on having
 gone to look fo
r hay and havin
g picked up one 
of the wealthies
t heiresses in R
"ussia, he grew
"
angry. It made h
im angry just be
cause the idea o
f marrying the g
entle Princess 
"Mary, who was at"
tractive to him 
and had an enorm
"ous fortune,
ha"
d against his wi
ll more than onc
e entered his he
ad. For himself 
 personally Nich
olas could not w
ish for a better
 wife: by marryi
ng her he would
 make the counte
ss his mother ha
"ppy, would be ab"
le to put his f
ather’s affair
"s in order, and "
would even—he 
felt it—ensure
 Princess Mary�
��s happiness. 
 But Sónya? An
d his plighted w
ord? That was wh
y Rostóv grew a
ngry when he wa
s rallied about 
Princess Bolkón
skaya.     
 CHAPTER XV  
On receiving com
mand of the armi
es Kutúzov reme
mbered Prince An
drew and sent a
n order for him 
to report at hea
dquarters.  Pr
ince Andrew arri
ved at Tsárevo-
Zaymíshche on t
he very day and 
at the very hou
r that Kutúzov 
was reviewing th
e troops for the
 first time. He 
 stopped in the 
village at the p
riest’s house 
in front of whic
h stood the com
mander in chief�
"��s carriage, an"
d he sat down on
 the bench at th
e gate awaiting
 his Serene High
"ness, as everyon"
e now called Kut
úzov. From the 
 field beyond th
e village came n
ow sounds of reg
imental music an
d now the roar 
of many voices s
houting “Hurra
h!” to the new
 commander in ch
ief. Two orderl
"ies, a courier a"
"nd a major-domo,"
" stood near by, "
some ten paces 
from Prince Andr
"ew, availing the"
mselves of Kutú
zov’s absence 
and of the fine
 weather. A shor
"t, swarthy lieut"
enant colonel of
 hussars with th
ick mustaches a
nd whiskers rode
 up to the gate 
"and, glancing at"
" Prince
Andrew,"
 inquired whethe
r his Serene Hig
hness was puttin
g up there and 
whether he would
 soon be back. 
 Prince Andrew 
replied that he 
was not on his S
erene Highness�
� staff but was
 himself a new a
rrival. The lieu
tenant colonel t
urned to a smart
"
orderly, who, "
with the peculia
r contempt with 
which a commande
r in chief’s 
orderly speaks t
"o officers, repl"
ied:  “What?
 His Serene High
ness? I expect h
e’ll be here s
oon. What do you
 want?”  Th
e lieutenant col
onel of hussars 
smiled beneath h
is mustache at t
he orderly’s 
"tone, dismounted"
", gave his horse"
 to a dispatch r
"unner, and
appr"
oached Bolkónsk
i with a slight 
bow. Bolkónski 
made room for hi
m on the bench 
and the lieutena
nt colonel sat d
own beside him. 
  “You’re a
lso waiting for 
the commander in

�m Lieutenant C
"olonel Denísov,"
 better known as
" ‘Váska,’�"
"� said Denísov,"
 pressing Princ
e Andrew’s han
d and looking in
to his face with
 a particularly
 kindly attentio
"n. “Yes, I hea"
"rd,” said he s"
"ympathetically,"
 and after a sho
rt pause added: 
"“Yes, it’s S"
cythian warfare.
 It’s all vew
y well—only no

swayed his head.
 “Vewy pleased
", Pwince, to mak"
e your acquaint
ance!” he repe
"ated again, smil"
"ing sadly, and h"
e again pressed
 Prince Andrew�
�s hand.  Prin
ce Andrew knew D
enísov from wha
t Natásha had t
old him of her f
irst suitor. Th
is memory carrie
d him sadly and 
sweetly back to 
those painful f
eelings of which
 he had not thou
"ght lately, but "
which still foun
d place in his 
soul. Of late he
 had received so
 many new and ve
ry serious impr
essions—such a
s the retreat fr
"om Smolénsk, hi"
s visit to Bald 
"Hills,
and the "
recent news of h
is father’s de
ath—and had ex
perienced so man
"y
emotions, tha"
t for a long tim
e past those mem
ories had not en
"tered his
mind,"
 and now that th
"ey did, they did"
 not act on him 
with nearly thei
r former streng
th. For Denísov
", too, the memor"
ies awakened by 
the name of Bol
kónski belonged
" to a distant, r"
"omantic past, wh"
en after supper 
and after Natá
sha’s singing 
he had proposed 
to a little girl
 of fifteen wit
hout realizing w
hat he was doing
. He smiled at t
he recollection 
of that time an
d of his love fo
"r Natásha, and "
passed at once t
o what now inte
rested him passi
onately and excl
usively. This wa
s a plan of camp
aign he had dev
ised while servi
ng at the outpos
ts during the re
treat. He had p
roposed that pla
n to Barclay de 
Tolly and now wi
shed to propose 
it to Kutúzov.
 The plan was ba
sed on the fact 
that the French 
line of operati
on was too exten
"ded, and it prop"
osed that instea
"d of, or
concur"
"rently with, act"
ion on the front
 to bar the adva
nce of the Frenc
"h,
we should at"
tack their line 
of communication
. He began expla
ining his plan 
to Prince Andrew
.  “They can
’t hold all th
at line. It’s 
impossible. I wi
ll undertake to 
 bweak thwough. 
Give me five hun
dwed men and I w
ill bweak the li
"ne,
that’s ce"
rtain! There’s
 only one way—
guewilla warfare
!”  Denísov
 rose and began 
gesticulating as
 he explained hi
s plan to Bolk�
�nski. In the mi
dst of his expla
nation shouts we
re heard from th
"e
army, growing"
 more incoherent
 and more diffus
"ed, mingling wit"
h music and son
gs and coming fr
om the field whe
re the review wa
s held. Sounds o
f hoofs and sho
uts were nearing
 the village.  
 “He’s comin
g! He’s coming
!” shouted a C
ossack standing 
at the gate.  
Bolkónski and D
enísov moved to
" the gate, at wh"
ich a knot of so
ldiers (a guard
 of honor) was s
"tanding, and the"
y saw Kutúzov c
oming down the 
street mounted o
n a rather small
 sorrel horse. A
 huge suite of g
enerals rode be
hind him. Barcla
y was riding alm
"ost beside him, "
and a crowd of 
officers ran aft
er and around th
"em shouting, “"
Hurrah!”  Hi
s adjutants gall
oped into the ya
rd before him. K
utúzov was impa
tiently urging 
"on his horse, wh"
ich ambled smoot
hly under his we
"ight, and he
ra"
ised his hand to
 his white Horse
 Guard’s cap w
ith a red band a
"nd no
peak, nod"
ding his head co
ntinually. When 
he came up to th
e guard of hono
"r, a fine set of"
 Grenadiers most
ly wearing decor
"ations, who were"
 giving him the
" salute, he look"
ed at them silen
tly and attentiv
ely for nearly 
a minute with th
e steady gaze of
 a commander and
 then turned to 
 the crowd of ge
nerals and offic
ers surrounding 
him. Suddenly hi
s face assumed 
a subtle express
"ion, he shrugged"
 his shoulders w
ith an air of p
erplexity.  �
�And with such f
ine fellows to r
etreat and retre
"at! Well, good-b"
"y,
General,” "
"he added, and ro"
de into the yard
 past Prince And
rew and Deníso
v.  “Hurrah!
 hurrah! hurrah!
” shouted thos
e behind him.  
 Since Prince An
drew had last se
en him Kutúzov 
had grown still 
"more
corpulent,"
" flaccid, and fa"
t. But the bleac
"hed eyeball, the"
" scar, and the
"
familiar wearine
ss of his expres
sion were still 
the same. He was
 wearing the wh
ite Horse Guard�
��s cap and a mi
litary overcoat 
with a whip hang
ing over his sh
oulder by a thin
 strap. He sat h
eavily and swaye
d limply on his
 brisk little ho
rse.  “Whew.
.. whew... whew!
” he whistled 
just audibly as 
he rode into the
 yard. His face
 expressed the r
elief of relaxed
 strain felt by 
a man who means
 to rest after a
 ceremony. He dr
ew his left foot
 out of the stir
"rup
and, lurchi"
ng with his whol
e body and pucke
ring his face wi
"th the
effort, "
raised it with d
ifficulty onto t
"he saddle, leane"
"d on his knee,
"
"groaned, and sli"
pped down into t
he arms of the C
ossacks and adju
tants who stood
 ready to assist
 him.  He pull
ed himself toget
"her, looked roun"
"d, screwing up h"
"is eyes, glanced"
 at Prince Andr
"ew, and, evident"
ly not recognizi
"ng him, moved wi"
th his waddling
 gait to the por
ch. “Whew... w
hew... whew!” 
"he whistled, and"
 again glanced 
at Prince Andrew
. As often occur
"s with old men, "
it was only aft
er some seconds 
that the impress
ion produced by 
Prince Andrew’
s face linked i
tself up with Ku
túzov’s remem
brance of his pe
rsonality.  �
"�Ah, how do you "
"do, my dear prin"
ce? How do you d
"o, my dear boy? "
Come along...�
"� said he, glanc"
ing wearily roun
"d, and he steppe"
d onto the porch
 which creaked 
under his weight
.  He unbutton
ed his coat and 
sat down on a be
nch in the porch
.  “And how�
��s your father?
”  “I rece
ived news of his
" death, yesterda"
"y,” replied Pr"
ince Andrew abr
uptly.  Kutúz
ov looked at him
 with eyes wide 
open with dismay
 and then took o
ff his cap and 
crossed himself:
  “May the k
ingdom of Heaven
 be his! God’s
 will be done to
 us all!” He 
"sighed deeply, h"
is whole chest h
"eaving, and was "
silent for a whi
le. “I loved 
him and respecte
"d him, and sympa"
thize with you w
ith all my heart
.”  He embra
ced Prince Andre
"w, pressing him "
to his fat breas
"t, and for some"
 time did not le
t him go. When h
e released him P
rince Andrew saw
 that Kutúzov�
��s flabby lips 
were trembling a
nd that tears we
re in his eyes. 
He sighed and p
ressed on the be
nch with both ha
nds to raise him
self.  “Come
"! Come with me, "
we’ll have a t
"alk,” said he."
  But at that 
"moment Denísov,"
 no more intimid
ated by his supe
riors than by t
"he enemy, came w"
ith jingling spu
rs up the steps 
"of the porch, de"
spite the angry
 whispers of the
 adjutants who t
ried to stop him
". Kutúzov, his"
 hands still pre
ssed on the seat
", glanced at him"
 glumly. Deníso
"v, having
given"
" his name, annou"
nced that he had
 to communicate 
to his Serene H
ighness a matter
 of great import
ance for their c
ountry’s welfa
re. Kutúzov lo
oked wearily at 
"him and, lifting"
 his hands with 
a gesture of an
"noyance, folded "
them across his 
"stomach, repeati"
ng the words: �
�For our countr
y’s welfare? W
"ell, what is it?"
 Speak!” Dení
sov blushed like
 a girl (it was
 strange to see 
the color rise i
"n that shaggy, b"
"ibulous,
time-w"
orn face) and bo
ldly began to ex
pound his plan o
f cutting the e
nemy’s lines o
f communication 
between Smoléns
k and Vyázma. D
enísov came fr
om those parts a
nd knew the coun
try well. His pl
an seemed decide
"dly
a good one,"
 especially from
 the strength of
 conviction with
 which he spoke
. Kutúzov looke
d down at his ow
"n legs, occasion"
ally glancing at
 the door of th
e adjoining hut 
as if expecting 
something unplea
sant to emerge 
from it. And fro
"m that hut, whil"
e Denísov was s
"peaking, a gener"
al with a portf
olio under his a
rm really did ap
pear.  “What
?” said Kutúz
"ov, in the midst"
 of Denísov’s
" explanations, �"
��are you ready
 so soon?”  
"“Ready, your S"
"erene Highness,�"
�� replied the g
eneral.  Kutú
zov swayed his h
"ead, as much as "
to say: “How i
s one man to dea
l with it all?�
�� and again lis
tened to Deníso
v.  “I give 
my word of honor
 as a Wussian of
"ficer,” said D"
"enísov, “that"
 I can bweak Na
poleon’s line 
of communication
!”  “What 
relation are you
 to Intendant Ge
neral Kiríl And
réevich Deníso
v?” asked Kut
"úzov, interrupt"
ing him.  “H
"e is my uncle, y"
our Sewene Highn
ess.”  “Ah
", we were friend"
"s,” said Kutú"
zov cheerfully. 
"“All right, al"
"l right,
friend"
", stay here at t"
he staff and tom
orrow we’ll ha
ve a talk.”  
 With a nod to D
enísov he turne
d away and put o
ut his hand for 
the papers Kono
vnítsyn had bro
ught him.  “
Would not your S
erene Highness l
ike to come insi
de?” said the 
general on duty
 in a discontent
"ed voice, “the"
 plans must be e
xamined and seve
ral papers have
 to be signed.�
�  An adjutant
 came out and an
nounced that eve
rything was in r
eadiness within
. But Kutúzov e
vidently did not
 wish to enter t
hat room till he
 was disengaged
. He made a grim
ace....  “No
", tell them to b"
ring a small tab
"le out here, my "
dear boy. I’ll
 look at them h
"ere,” said he."
 “Don’t go a
"way,” he added"
", turning to Pri"
"nce
Andrew, who"
 remained in the
 porch and liste
ned to the gener
al’s report. 
 While this was
" being given, Pr"
ince Andrew hear
d the whisper of
 a woman’s vo
ice and the rust
le of a silk dre
ss behind the do
or. Several time
s on glancing t
hat way he notic
ed behind that d
"oor a plump, ros"
"y, handsome
wom"
an in a pink dre
ss with a lilac 
silk kerchief on
" her head, holdi"
ng a dish and e
vidently awaitin
g the entrance o
f the commander 
in chief. Kutú
zov’s adjutant
 whispered to Pr
ince Andrew that
 this was the wi
fe of the pries
t whose home it 
"was, and that sh"
e intended to of
fer his Serene 
Highness bread a
nd salt. “Her 
husband has welc
omed his Serene 
Highness with t
he cross at the 
"church, and she "
intends to welco
me him in the h
ouse.... She’s
" very pretty,”"
 added the adjut
ant with a smile
. At those word
s Kutúzov looke
d round. He was 
listening to the
 general’s re
port—which con
sisted chiefly o
f a criticism of
 the position at
 Tsárevo-Zaym�
�shche—as he h
ad listened to D
"enísov, and sev"
en years previo
usly had listene
d to the discuss
ion at the Auste
rlitz council of
 war. He eviden
tly listened onl
y because he had
" ears which, tho"
ugh there was a
 piece of tow in
" one of them, co"
uld not help hea
ring; but it wa
s evident that n
othing the gener
al could say wou
ld surprise or e
ven interest hi
"m, that he knew "
all that would b
e said beforehan
"d, and heard
it"
 all only becaus
"e he had to, as "
one has to liste
n to the chantin
g of a service 
of prayer. All t
hat Denísov had
 said was clever
 and to the poi
nt. What the gen
eral was saying 
was even more cl
ever and to the
" point, but it w"
as evident that 
Kutúzov despise
d knowledge and
" cleverness, and"
 knew of somethi
ng else that wou
ld decide the m
atter—somethin
g independent of
 cleverness and 
knowledge. Princ
e Andrew watche
d the commander 
in chief’s fac
"e attentively, a"
nd the only exp
ression he could
 see there was o
"ne of boredom, c"
uriosity as to t
he meaning of t
he feminine whis
pering behind th
"e door, and a de"
sire to observe
 propriety. It w
as evident that 
Kutúzov despise
d cleverness and
 learning and e
ven the patrioti
c feeling shown 
"by Denísov, but"
 despised them 
not because of h
is own intellect
", feelings, or k"
nowledge—he di
d not try to di
splay any of the
se—but because
 of something el
se. He despised 
 them because of
 his old age and
 experience of l
ife. The only in
struction Kutú
zov gave of his 
own accord durin
g that report re
ferred to lootin
g by the Russia
n troops. At the
 end of the repo
rt the general p
ut before him f
or signature a p
aper relating to
 the recovery of
 payment from ar
my commanders f
or green oats mo
wn down by the s
"oldiers, when la"
ndowners lodged
 petitions for c
ompensation.  
After hearing th
"e matter, Kutúz"
ov smacked his l
ips together and
 shook his head
.  “Into the
 stove... into t
he fire with it!
 I tell you once
" for all, my
de"
"ar fellow,” sa"
"id he, “into t"
he fire with all
 such things! Le
t them cut the 
crops and burn w
ood to their hea
rts’ content. 
I don’t order 
"it
or allow it,"
 but I don’t e
xact compensatio
n either. One ca
n’t get on wi
thout it. ‘Whe
n wood is choppe
d the chips will
 fly.’” He l
ooked at the pa
per again. “Oh
", this German pr"
ecision!” he m
"uttered, shaking"
 his head.   
   CHAPTER XV
"I

“Well, th"
at’s all!” s
aid Kutúzov as 
he signed the la
st of the docume
"nts,
and rising"
 heavily and smo
othing out the f
olds in his fat 
white neck he m
oved toward the 
door with a more
 cheerful expres
sion.  The pri

 caught up the d

ed to present at
 the right momen
"t, though she ha"
d so long been

 bow offered it 
to Kutúzov.  
He screwed up hi
"s eyes, smiled, "
lifted her chin 
"with his hand, a"
nd said:  “A
"h, what a beauty"
"! Thank you, swe"
etheart!”  H
e took some gold
 pieces from his
 trouser pocket 
and put them on 
the dish for he
"r. “Well, my d"
"ear, and how are"
 we getting on?�
"�� he asked,
mo"
ving to the door
 of the room ass
igned to him. Th
e priest’s wif
"e
smiled, and w"
ith dimples in h
er rosy cheeks f
ollowed him into
 the room. The 
adjutant came ou
t to the porch a
nd asked Prince 
Andrew to lunch 
with him. Half 
an hour later Pr
ince Andrew was 
again called to 
Kutúzov. He fo
und him reclinin
g in an armchair
", still in the s"
ame unbuttoned 
overcoat. He had
 in his hand a F
rench book which
 he closed as Pr
ince Andrew ent
"ered, marking th"
e place with a k
nife. Prince And
rew saw by the 
cover that it wa
s Les Chevaliers
 du Cygne by Mad
ame de Genlis. 
"
“Well, sit d"
"own, sit down he"
re. Let’s have
" a talk,” said"
 Kutúzov. “It
"’s
sad, very "
sad. But remembe
"r, my dear fello"
"w, that I am a f"
"ather to you,
a"
 second father..
..”  Prince 
Andrew told Kut�
�zov all he knew
 of his father�
"�s death, and wh"
at he had seen 
at Bald Hills wh
en he passed thr
ough it.  “W
hat... what they
 have brought us
 to!” Kutúzov
 suddenly cried 
in an agitated 
"voice, evidently"
 picturing vivid
ly to himself fr
om Prince Andre
w’s story the 
condition Russia
 was in. “But 
"give me time, gi"
ve me time!” 
he said with a g
"rim look, eviden"
tly not wishing 
to continue this
 agitating conv
"ersation, and ad"
ded: “I sent f
or you to keep y
ou with me.” 
 “I thank you
r Serene Highnes
"s, but I fear I "
am no longer fit
" for the
staff,"
” replied Prin
ce Andrew with a
 smile which Kut
úzov noticed. 
 Kutúzov glanc
ed inquiringly a
t him.  “But
" above all,” a"
dded Prince Andr
"ew, “I have gr"
own used to my r
"egiment,

d of the officer
"s, and I fancy t"
he men also like

 sorry to leave

honor of being w
"ith you,
believ"
e me...”  A 
"shrewd, kindly, "
yet subtly deris
ive expression l
it up Kutúzov�
�s podgy face. 
He cut Bolkónsk
i short.  “I
" am sorry, for I"
 need you. But y
"ou’re right, y"
ou’re right! I
t’s not here 
that men are nee

 I remember you 
at Austerlitz...
". I remember,
y"
"es, I remember y"
ou with the stan
dard!” said Ku
"túzov, and a fl"
ush of pleasure
 suffused Prince
 Andrew’s face
 at this recolle
ction.  Taking
 his hand and dr
awing him downwa
"rds, Kutúzov of"
fered his cheek 
"to
be kissed, a"
nd again Prince 
Andrew noticed t
ears in the old 
man’s eyes. T
hough Prince And
rew knew that Ku
túzov’s tears
" came easily, an"
d that he was p
articularly tend
er to and consid
erate of him fro
m a wish to sho
w sympathy with 
"his loss, yet th"
is reminder of A
usterlitz was bo
th pleasant and
 flattering to h
im.  “Go you
r way and God be
 with you. I kno
w your path is t
he path of hono
r!” He paused.
 “I missed you
" at Bucharest, b"
ut I needed some
one to send.”
 And changing th
"e subject, Kutú"
zov began to spe
ak of the Turkis
h war and the p
eace that had be
en concluded. �
"�Yes, I have bee"
"n much
blamed,�"
"�� he said, “b"
oth for that war
 and the peace..
. but everything
 came at the ri
ght time. Tout v
ient à point à

 there were as m

" he went on, ret"
urning to the s
ubject of “adv

vidently occupie
"d him. “Ah, th"

� said he. “If
 we had listened
 to them all we 
should not have

had not died. He
 stormed fortres

" For that, not s"

” He swayed hi
s head. “And t

 growing warmer 
and beating his

Kutúzov gave a 
sigh of relief a
nd went on with 
his unfinished 
"novel, Les Cheva"
liers du Cygne b
y Madame de Genl
is.  Prince An
drew could not h
ave explained ho
"w or why it was,"
 but after that 
 interview with 
Kutúzov he went
 back to his reg
iment reassured 
as to the gener
al course of aff
airs and as to t
he man to whom i
t had been entr
usted. The more 
he realized the 
absence of all p
ersonal motive i
n that old man�
��in whom there 
seemed to remain
 only the habit 
"of passions,
an"
d in place of an
 intellect (grou
ping events and 
drawing conclusi
ons) only the c
apacity calmly t
o contemplate th
e course of even
ts—the more r
eassured he was 
that everything 
would be as it s
hould. “He wil
l not bring in 
any plan of his

 devise or under
"take

 He will not hin
der anything us

nything harmful.
 He understands 
that there is s
omething stronge

n will—the ine
vitable course 
"of events, and h"
e can see them a
nd grasp their s
"ignificance,

 something else.
" And above all,�"
�� thought Princ
"e
Andrew, “on"
e believes in hi

" Russian, despit"

and because his 
voice shook when
 he said: ‘Wh

nd had a sob in 
it when he said 
 he would ‘mak

On such feelings

     CHAPTE
R XVII  After 
the Emperor had 
"left Moscow, lif"
e flowed on ther
e in its usual 
"course, and its "
course was so ve
ry usual that it
 was difficult t
o remember the 
recent days of p
atriotic elation
" and ardor, hard"
 to believe tha
t Russia was rea
lly in danger an
d that the membe
rs of the Englis
h Club were als
o sons of the Fa
therland ready t
o sacrifice ever
ything for it. 
The one thing th
at recalled the 
patriotic fervor
 everyone had d
isplayed during 
the Emperor’s 
stay was the cal
l for contributi
ons of men and 
"money, a necessi"
ty that as soon 
as the promises 
had been made a
"ssumed a legal, "
official form an
d became unavoid
able.  With th
e enemy’s appr
"oach to Moscow, "
the Moscovites�
� view of their 
 situation did n
ot grow more ser
ious but on the 
contrary became 
even more frivo
"lous, as always "
happens with peo
ple who see a gr
eat danger appr
oaching. At the 
approach of dang
er there are alw
ays two voices t
hat speak with 
equal power in t
he human soul: o
ne very reasonab
ly tells a man 
to consider the 
nature of the da
nger and the mea
ns of escaping i
"t;
the other, s"
till more reason
"ably, says that "
it is too depres
sing and painfu
l to think of th
"e danger, since "
it is not in man
’s power to f
oresee everythin
g and avert the 
general course o
"f events, and it"
 is therefore b
etter to disrega
rd what is painf
ul till it comes
", and to
think "
about what is pl
easant. In solit
ude a man genera
lly listens to 
"the first voice,"
 but in society 
to the second. S
o it was now wit
h the inhabitan
ts of Moscow. It
 was long since 
people had been 
as gay in Mosco
w as that year. 
  Rostopchín�
"�s broadsheets, "
headed by woodcu
ts of a drink sh
"op, a potman,
a"
nd a Moscow burg
her called Karp�
"�shka Chigírin,"
 “who—having
 been a militia
man and having h
ad rather too mu
ch at the pub—
heard that Napol
eon wished to c
"ome to Moscow, g"
"rew angry, abuse"
d the French in 
very bad langua
"ge, came out of "
"the drink shop, "
"and, under the s"

ess the assemble

 In the corner

ed to read these
"
broadsheets, a"
nd some liked th
e way Karpúshka
 jeered at the F
"rench,
saying: "
“They will swe

"an cabbage, burs"
t with our buck
"wheat porridge, "
and choke themse
lves with cabbag
e soup. They are
 all dwarfs and
 one peasant wom
an will toss thr
ee of them with 
a hayfork.” O
thers did not li
ke that tone and
 said it was stu
pid and vulgar. 
It was said tha
t Rostopchín ha
d expelled all F
renchmen and eve
n all foreigners
"
from Moscow, a"
nd that there ha
d been some spie
s and agents of 
Napoleon among 
them; but this w
as told chiefly 
to introduce Ros
topchín’s wit
ty remark on th
at occasion. The
 foreigners were
 deported to Ní
"zhni by
boat, a"
nd Rostopchín h
ad said to them 
in French: “Re
ntrez en vous-m�
�mes; entrez da
"ns la barque, et"
 n’en faites p
as une barque de
 Charon.” * Th
ere was talk of
 all the governm
ent offices havi
ng been already 
removed from Mo
"scow, and to thi"
s Shinshín’s 
witticism was ad
ded—that for t
hat alone Mosco
w ought to be gr
ateful to Napole
on. It was said 
that Mamónov’
s regiment woul
d cost him eight
 hundred thousan
"d rubles, and th"
at Bezúkhov ha
d spent even mor
"e on his, but th"
at the best thin
g about Bezúkho
v’s action wa
s that he himsel
f was going to d
on a uniform and
 ride at the he
ad of his regime
nt without charg
ing anything for
 the show.    
   * “Think it
 over; get into 
"the barque, and "
take care not to
      make it a

Julie Drubetská
ya as she collec

d a young man in

 whom Julie call
ed “mon cheva

her to Nízhni. 
  In Julie’s

been agreed tha

 expressed perp

tely checked an

And he is so un

   CHAPTER XVI
II  When Pierr
e returned home 
he was handed tw
o of Rostopchín
’s broadsheets
 that had been 
brought that day
.  The first d
eclared that the
 report that Cou
nt Rostopchín h
ad forbidden pe
ople to leave Mo
scow was false; 
on the contrary 
he was glad that
 ladies and tra
desmen’s wives
 were leaving th
e city. “There
 will be less p
anic and less go
"ssip,” ran the"
 broadsheet “b
ut I will stake 
my life on it t
hat that scoundr
el will not ente
r Moscow.” The
se words showed 
Pierre clearly 
for the first ti
me that the Fren
ch would enter M
oscow. The seco
nd broadsheet st
ated that our he
adquarters were 
"at Vyázma, that"
 Count Wittgens
tein had defeate
"d the French, bu"
t that as many o
f the inhabitan
ts of Moscow wis
"hed to be armed,"
 weapons were re
ady for them at
 the arsenal: sa
"bers, pistols, a"
nd muskets which
 could be had at
 a low price. T
he tone of the p
roclamation was 
not as jocose as
 in the former 
Chigírin talks.
 Pierre pondered
 over these broa
dsheets. Evident
ly the terrible
 stormcloud he h
ad desired with 
the whole streng
th of his soul 
but which yet ar
oused involuntar
y horror in him 
was drawing near
.  “Shall I 
join the army an
d enter the serv
"ice, or wait?”"
 he asked himsel
f for the hundr
edth time. He to
ok a pack of car
ds that lay on t
he table and be
gan to lay them 
out for a game o
f patience.  �
��If this patien
"ce comes out,”"
 he said to hims
elf after shuffl
"ing the
cards, "
holding them in 
"his hand, and li"
"fting his head, "
“if it comes o
"ut,
it means..."
 what does it me
an?”  He had
 not decided wha
t it should mean
 when he heard t
he voice of the 
 eldest princess
 at the door ask
ing whether she 
might come in. 
 “Then it wil
l mean that I mu
st go to the arm
"y,” said Pierr"
e to himself. �
"��Come in, come "
in!” he added 
to the princess.
  Only the eld
"est princess, th"
e one with the s
tony face and lo
"ng waist,
was s"
till living in P
ierre’s house.
 The two younger
 ones had both 
married.  “E
xcuse my coming 
"to you, cousin,�"
�� she said in a
 reproachful and
 agitated voice
. “You know so
me decision must
 be come to. Wha
t is going to h
appen? Everyone 
has left Moscow 
and the people a
re rioting. How 
is it that we a
re staying on?�
�  “On the c
"ontrary, things "
seem satisfactor
"y, ma cousine,�"
� said Pierre i
n the bantering 
tone he habitual
ly adopted towar
"d her, always fe"
eling uncomfort
able in the role
 of her benefact
or.  “Satisf
"actory, indeed! "
Very satisfactor
y! Barbara Iván
ovna told me tod
ay how our troo
ps are distingui
shing themselves
. It certainly d
oes them credit
! And the people
 too are quite m
utinous—they n
"o longer obey,
"
even my maid has
 taken to being 
rude. At this ra
te they will soo
n begin beating
 us. One can’t
 walk in the str
"eets. But, above"
" all, the French"
 will be here a
"ny day now, so w"
hat are we waiti
ng for? I ask ju
st one thing of
" you, cousin,”"
" she went on, �"
�arrange for me 
to be taken to 
Petersburg. What
"ever I may be, I"
 can’t live un
der Bonaparte’
s rule.”  �
"�Oh, come, ma co"
usine! Where do 
you get your inf
ormation from? O
n the contrary.
..”  “I wo
n’t submit to 
your Napoleon! O
thers may if the
y please.... If 
you don’t wan
t to do this...�
��  “But I w
"ill, I’ll give"
 the order at on
ce.”  The pr
incess was appar
ently vexed at n
ot having anyone
 to be angry wit
h. Muttering to
" herself, she sa"
t down on a chai
r.  “But you
 have been misin
"formed,” said "
Pierre. “Every
thing is quiet i
n the city and 
there is not the
 slightest dange
r. See! I’ve j
ust been readin
g...” He showe
d her the broads
heet. “Count R
ostopchín write
s that he will 
stake his life o
n it that the en
emy will not ent
er Moscow.”  
"
“Oh, that cou"
nt of yours!” 
said the princes
s malevolently. 
“He is a hypo
"crite, a rascal "
who has himself 
roused the peopl
e to riot. Didn�
��t he write in
 those idiotic b
roadsheets that 
"anyone, ‘whoev"
"er it might be,"
 should be dragg
ed to the lockup
 by his hair’?
 (How silly!) �
�And honor and 
glory to whoever
" captures him,�"
� he says. This 
is what his cajo
lery has brough
t us to! Barbara
 Ivánovna told 
me the mob near 
killed her beca
use she said som
ething in French
".”

“Oh, b"
ut it’s so... 
You take everyth
"ing so to heart,"
"” said Pierre,"
 and began layi
ng out his cards
 for patience. 
 Although that 
patience did com
"e out, Pierre di"
d not join the a
"rmy,
but remain"
ed in deserted M
oscow ever in th
e same state of 
"agitation,
irre"
"solution, and al"
"arm, yet at the "
same time joyful
ly expecting so
mething terrible
.  Next day to
ward evening the
 princess set of
"f, and Pierre’"
s head steward 
came to inform h
im that the mone
y needed for the
 equipment of hi
s regiment coul
d not be found w
ithout selling o
ne of the estate
s. In general t
he head steward 
made out to Pier
re that his proj
ect of raising 
a regiment would
 ruin him. Pierr
e listened to hi
"m, scarcely able"
 to repress a s
mile.  “Well
" then, sell it,�"
�� said he. “W
hat’s to be do
ne? I can’t dr
aw back now!”
  The worse ev
"erything became,"
 especially his 
"own affairs, the"
 better was Pie
rre pleased and 
the more evident
 was it that the
 catastrophe he 
 expected was ap
proaching. Hardl
y anyone he knew
 was left in tow
n. Julie had go
"ne, and so had P"
rincess Mary. Of
 his intimate fr
iends only the 
Rostóvs remaine
"d, but he did no"
t go to see them
.  To distract
 his thoughts he
 drove that day 
to the village o
f Vorontsóvo t
o see the great 
balloon Leppich 
was constructing
 to destroy the 
"foe,
and a tria"
l balloon that w
as to go up next
 day. The balloo
n was not yet r
"eady, but Pierre"
 learned that it
 was being const
ructed by the Em
peror’s desir
e. The Emperor h
ad written to Co
unt Rostopchín 
as follows:  A
s soon as Leppic
"h is ready, get "
together a crew 
of reliable and 
 intelligent men
 for his car and
 send a courier 
to General Kutú
zov to let him 
know. I have inf
ormed him of the
 matter.  Plea
se impress upon 
Leppich to be ve
ry careful where
 he descends for
 the first time
", that he may no"
t make a mistake
 and fall into t
he enemy’s ha
nds. It is essen
tial for him to 
combine his move
ments with those
 of the command
er in chief.  
 On his way hom
e from Vorontsó
"vo, as he was pa"
ssing the Bolót
noe Place Pierr
"e, seeing a larg"
e crowd round th
"e Lóbnoe Place,"
 stopped and got
 out of his tra
p. A French cook
 accused of bein
g a spy was bein
g flogged. The 
flogging was onl
"y just over, and"
 the executioner
 was releasing f
rom the floggin
g bench a stout 
man with red whi
"skers, in blue s"
tockings and a 
"green jacket, wh"
o was moaning pi
teously. Another
" criminal, thin "
"and
pale, stood"
 near. Judging b
y their faces th
ey were both Fre
nchmen. With a 
frightened and s
uffering look re
sembling that on
 the thin French
"man’s
face, P"
ierre pushed his
 way in through 
the crowd.  �
�What is it? Who
 is it? What is 
it for?” he ke
pt asking.  Bu
t the attention 
of the crowd—o
"fficials, burghe"
"rs, shopkeepers,"
"
peasants, and "
women in cloaks 
and in pelisses�
��was so eagerly
 centered on wh
at was passing i
n Lóbnoe Place 
that no one answ
ered him. The st

 in the way full

gh angry with hi
mself for doing 
so. In the crowd
 people began t
"alking loudly, t"
o stifle their f
eelings of pity 
as it seemed to 
 Pierre.  “H
e’s cook to so
me prince.”  
"
“Eh, mounseer"
", Russian sauce "
seems to be sour
 to a Frenchman.

nding behind Pie
"rre,
when the F"
renchman began t
o cry.  The cl
erk glanced roun
"d, evidently hop"
ing that his jok
e would be appr
eciated. Some pe
ople began to la
"ugh, others cont"
inued to watch i
n dismay the ex
ecutioner who wa
s undressing the
 other man.  P
"ierre choked, hi"
"s face puckered,"
 and he turned h
"astily away, wen"
t back to his t
rap muttering so
mething to himse
"lf as he went, a"
nd took his sea
t. As they drove
 along he shudde
red and exclaime
d several times 
so audibly that
 the coachman as
ked him:  “W
hat is your plea
sure?”  “W
here are you goi
ng?” shouted P
ierre to the man
", who was drivin"
g to Lubyánka 
Street.  “To
 the Governor’
"s, as you ordere"
"d,” answered t"
he coachman.  
“Fool! Idiot!�
�� shouted Pierr
"e, abusing his c"
oachman—a thin
g he rarely did
". “Home, I tol"
d you! And drive
" faster, blockhe"

"very day,” he "
murmured to hims
elf.  At the s
ight of the tort
ured Frenchman a
nd the crowd sur
rounding the L�
"�bnoe Place, Pie"
rre had so defin
itely made up hi
s mind that he c
ould no longer 
remain in Moscow
 and would leave
 for the army th
at very day that
 it seemed to h
im that either h
e had told the c
oachman this or 
that the man ou
ght to have know
n it for himself
.  On reaching
 home Pierre gav
e orders to Evst
áfey—his head
 coachman who k
"new everything, "
could do anythin
"g, and was known"
 to all Moscow�
�that he would 
leave that night
 for the army at
" Mozháysk, and "
that his saddle 
 horses should b
e sent there. Th
is could not all
 be arranged tha
"t day,
so on Ev"
stáfey’s repr
esentation Pierr
e had to put off
 his departure t
ill next day to
 allow time for 
the relay horses
 to be sent on i
n advance.  On
 the twenty-four
th the weather c
leared up after 
"a spell of rain,"
 and after dinn
er Pierre left M
oscow. When chan
ging horses that
 night in Perkh
"úshkovo, he lea"
rned that there 
had been a great
 battle that ev
ening. (This was
 the battle of S
hevárdino.) He 
was told that th
ere in Perkhús
hkovo the earth 
trembled from th
"e firing, but no"
body could answe
r his questions
 as to who had w
on. At dawn next
 day Pierre was 
approaching Moz
háysk.  Every
 house in Mozhá
ysk had soldiers
 quartered in it
", and at the hos"
tel where Pierr
e was met by his
 groom and coach
man there was no
 room to be had
. It was full of
 officers.  Ev
erywhere in Mozh
áysk and beyond
" it, troops were"
 stationed or on
 the march. Cos
"sacks, foot and "
"horse soldiers, "
"wagons, caissons"
", and cannon
we"
re everywhere. P
ierre pushed for
ward as fast as 
"he could, and th"
e farther he le
ft Moscow behind
 and the deeper 
he plunged into 
that sea of tro
ops the more was
 he overcome by 
restless agitati
on and a new and
 joyful feeling
 he had not expe
rienced before. 
It was a feeling
 akin to what h
e had felt at th
e Slobóda Palac
e during the Emp
eror’s visit�
�a sense of the
 necessity of un
dertaking someth
ing and sacrific
ing something. 
He now experienc
ed a glad consci
ousness that eve
rything that co
nstitutes men’
s happiness—th
e comforts of li
"fe, wealth, even"
 life itself—
is rubbish it is
 pleasant to thr
"ow away, compare"
d with somethin
g... With what? 
Pierre could not
" say, and he did"
 not try to det
ermine for whom 
and for what he 
felt such partic
ular delight in 
 sacrificing eve
rything. He was 
not occupied wit
h the question o
f what to sacri
fice for; the fa
ct of sacrificin
g in itself affo
rded him a new a
nd joyous sensa
tion.      
 CHAPTER XIX  
On the twenty-fo
urth of August t
he battle of the
 Shevárdino Red
oubt was fought
", on the twenty-"
fifth not a shot
 was fired by ei
"ther side, and o"
n the twenty-si
xth the battle o
f Borodinó itse
lf took place. 
 Why and how we
re the battles o
f Shevárdino an
d Borodinó give
n and accepted?
 Why was the bat
tle of Borodinó
 fought? There w
as not the least
 sense in it fo
r either the Fre
nch or the Russi
ans. Its immedia
te result for t
"he Russians was,"
 and was bound t
"o be, that we we"
re brought neare
r to the destru
ction of Moscow�
��which we feare
d more than anyt
hing in the wor
ld; and for the 
French its immed
iate result was 
that they were 
brought nearer t
o the destructio
n of their whole
 army—which th
ey feared more 
than anything in
 the world. What
 the result must
 be was quite o
"bvious, and yet "
Napoleon offered
 and Kutúzov ac
cepted that batt
le.  If the co
mmanders had bee
n guided by reas
"on, it would see"
m that it must 
have been obviou
s to Napoleon th
at by advancing 
thirteen hundred
 miles and givi
ng battle with a
 probability of 
losing a quarter
" of his army,
h"
e was advancing 
to certain destr
"uction, and it m"
ust have been eq
ually clear to 
Kutúzov that by
 accepting battl
e and risking th
e loss of a qua
rter of his army
 he would certai
nly lose Moscow.
 For Kutúzov th
is was mathemat
"ically clear, as"
 it is that if w
hen playing drau
ghts I have one 
 man less and go
" on exchanging, "
I shall certainl
"y lose, and ther"
efore should no
t exchange. When
 my opponent has
 sixteen men and
 I have fourtee
"n, I am only one"
 eighth weaker t
"han he, but when"
 I have exchange
d thirteen more
 men he will be 
three times as s
trong as I am. 
 Before the bat
tle of Borodinó
 our strength in
 proportion to t
he French was a
bout as five to 
"six, but after t"
hat battle it wa
s little more th
an one to two: 
previously we ha
d a hundred thou
sand against a h
undred and twen
ty thousand; aft
erwards little m
ore than fifty t
housand against 
a hundred thous
and. Yet the shr
ewd and experien
ced Kutúzov acc
epted the battl
"e, while Napoleo"
"n, who was said "
to be a commande
"r of genius,
ga"
"ve it, losing a "
quarter of his a
rmy and lengthen
ing his lines of
 communication 
still more. If i
t is said that h
e expected to en
d the campaign 
by occupying Mos
cow as he had en
ded a previous c
ampaign by occu
"pying Vienna, th"
ere is much evid
ence to the cont
rary. Napoleon�
�s historians t
hemselves tell u
s that from Smol
énsk onwards he
 wished to stop
", knew the dange"
r of his extende
"d position, and "
knew that the o
ccupation of Mos
cow would not be
 the end of the 
"campaign, for he"
 had seen at Sm
olénsk the stat
e in which Russi
an towns were le
"ft to him, and
"
had not received
 a single reply 
to his repeated 
announcements of
 his wish to ne
gotiate.  In g
iving and accept
ing battle at Bo
"rodinó, Kutúzo"
v acted involunt
arily and irrat
ionally. But lat
"er on, to fit wh"
"at had occurred,"
 the historians 
 provided cunnin
gly devised evid
ence of the fore
sight and genius
 of the general
"s who, of all th"
e blind tools of
 history were th
e most enslaved 
 and involuntary
.  The ancient
s have left us m
odel heroic poem
s in which the h
eroes furnish t
he whole interes
"t of the story, "
and we are still
 unable to accus
tom ourselves t
o the fact that 
for our epoch hi
stories of that 
kind are meanin
gless.  On the
" other question,"
 how the battle 
of Borodinó and
 the preceding 
battle of Shevá
rdino were fough
"t, there also ex"
ists a definite 
"and
well-known,"
 but quite false
", conception. Al"
l the historians
 describe the a
ffair as follows
:  The Russian
" army, they say,"
 in its retreat 
from Smolénsk s
ought out for i
tself the best p
osition for a ge
neral engagement
 and found such 
a position at B
orodinó.  The
" Russians, they "
"say, fortified t"
his position in 
advance on the l
eft of the high
road (from Mosco
w to Smolénsk) 
and almost at a 
right angle to 
"it, from Borodin"
"ó to Utítsa, a"
t the very place
 where the battl
e was fought. 
 In front of th
"is position, the"
"y say, a fortifi"
ed outpost was s
et up on the Sh
evárdino mound 
to observe the e
nemy. On the twe
"nty-fourth, we
"
"are told, Napole"
on attacked this
 advanced post a
"nd took it, and,"
 on the twenty-
"sixth, attacked "
the whole Russia
"n army, which wa"
s in position on
 the field of B
orodinó.  So 
the histories sa
"y, and it is all"
" quite wrong, as"
 anyone who care
s to look into 
the matter can e
asily convince h
imself.  The R
ussians did not 
seek out the bes
"t position but, "
"on the contrary,"
 during the ret
reat passed many
 positions bette
r than Borodinó
. They did not 
stop at any one 
of these positio
ns because Kutú
zov did not wish
 to occupy a po
sition he had no
t himself chosen
", because the po"
pular demand fo
r a battle had n
ot yet expressed
 itself strongly
" enough, and bec"
ause Milorádov
ich had not yet 
arrived with the
" militia, and fo"
r many other re
asons. The fact 
is that other po
sitions they had
 passed were str
"onger,
and that"
 the position at
 Borodinó (the 
one where the ba
ttle was fought)
",
far from bein"
"g strong, was no"
 more a position
 than any other 
spot one might 
find in the Russ
ian Empire by st
icking a pin int
o the map at ha
zard.  Not onl
y did the Russia
ns not fortify t
he position on t
he field of Bor
odinó to the le
"ft of, and at a "
"right angle to, "
the highroad (th
"at
is, the posi"
tion on which th
e battle took pl
"ace), but never "
till the twenty
-fifth of August
", 1812, did they"
 think that a ba
ttle might be f
ought there. Thi
s was shown firs
t by the fact th
at there were no
 entrenchments 
there by the twe
nty fifth and th
at those begun o
n the twenty-fi
fth and twenty-s
ixth were not co
"mpleted, and sec"
"ondly, by the
p"
osition of the S
hevárdino Redou
bt. That redoubt
 was quite sense
less in front o
f the position w
here the battle 
was accepted. Wh
y was it more s
trongly fortifie
d than any other
 post? And why w
ere all efforts 
 exhausted and s
ix thousand men 
sacrificed to de
fend it till lat
e at night on t
he twenty-fourth
? A Cossack patr
ol would have su
fficed to obser
ve the enemy. Th
"irdly, as proof "
that the positio
n on which the 
battle was fough
t had not been f
oreseen and that
 the Shevárdino
 Redoubt was no
t an advanced po
st of that posit
"ion, we have the"
 fact that up to
 the twenty-fif
"th, Barclay de T"
olly and Bagrati
ón were convinc
ed that the She
várdino Redoubt
 was the left fl
ank of the posit
"ion, and that Ku"
túzov himself 
"in his report, w"
ritten in hot ha
ste after the ba
"ttle, speaks of"
 the Shevárdino
 Redoubt as the 
left flank of th
e position. It w
"as much
later, "
when reports on 
the battle of Bo
rodinó were wri
"tten at leisure,"
 that the incor
rect and extraor
dinary statement
 was invented (p
robably to just
ify the mistakes
 of a commander 
in chief who had
 to be represent
ed as infallibl
e) that the Shev
árdino Redoubt 
was an advanced 
post—whereas 
in reality it wa
s simply a forti
fied point on th
e left flank—a
nd that the bat
tle of Borodinó
 was fought by u
s on an entrench
ed position pre
viously selected
", whereas it was"
 fought on a qui
te unexpected sp
ot which was al
most unentrenche
d.  The case w
as evidently thi
s: a position wa
s selected along
 the river Kolo
chá—which cro
sses the highroa
d not at a right
 angle but at an
 acute angle—
so that the left
 flank was at Sh
"evárdino, the r"
ight flank near 
the village of 
"Nóvoe, and the "
center at Borodi
nó at the confl
uence of the ri
vers Kolochá an
d Vóyna.  To 
anyone who looks
 at the field of
 Borodinó witho
ut thinking of h
ow the battle w
as actually foug
"ht, this positio"
"n, protected by "
the river Koloc
"há, presents it"
self as obvious 
for an army whos
e object was to 
 prevent an enem
y from advancing
 along the Smol�
�nsk road to Mos
cow.  Napoleon
", riding to Val�"
�evo on the twen
"ty-fourth, did n"
ot see (as the 
history books sa
y he did) the po
sition of the Ru
ssians from Utí
tsa to Borodin�
� (he could not 
have seen that p
osition because 
it did not exis
"t), nor did he s"
ee an advanced p
ost of the Russi
"an army, but whi"
le pursuing the
 Russian reargua
rd he came upon 
the left flank o
f the Russian p
osition—at the
 Shevárdino Red
oubt—and unexp
ectedly for the 
 Russians moved 
his army across 
the Kolochá. An
"d the Russians, "
not having time
 to begin a gene
"ral engagement, "
withdrew their l
eft wing from th
e position they
 had intended to
 occupy and took
 up a new positi
on which had no
t been foreseen 
and was not fort
ified. By crossi
ng to the other 
 side of the Kol
ochá to the lef
t of the highroa
"d, Napoleon shif"
ted the whole f
orthcoming battl
e from right to 
left (looking fr
om the Russian 
side) and transf
erred it to the 
plain between Ut
"ítsa, Semënovs"
"k, and
Borodin�"
�—a plain no m
ore advantageous
 as a position t
han any other pl
ain in Russia�
�and there the w
hole battle of t
he twenty-sixth 
of August took 
place.  Had Na
poleon not ridde
n out on the eve
ning of the twen
ty-fourth to the
"
Kolochá, and "
had he not then 
ordered an immed
iate attack on t
he redoubt but 
had begun the at
tack next mornin
"g, no one would "
have doubted tha
t the Shevárdi
no Redoubt was t
he left flank of
" our position, a"
nd the battle w
ould have taken 
place where we e
xpected it. In t
hat case we sho
uld probably hav
e defended the S
hevárdino Redou
bt—our left f
lank—still mor
e obstinately. W
e should have at
tacked Napoleon 
in the center o
"r on the right, "
and the engageme
nt would have ta
ken place on the
"
twenty-fifth, "
in the position 
we intended and 
had fortified. B
ut as the attac
k on our left fl
ank took place i
n the evening af
ter the retreat 
of our rear gua
"rd (that is, imm"
ediately after t
he fight at Grid
"nëva), and
as "
the Russian comm
anders did not w
"ish, or were not"
" in time, to beg"
in a general en
gagement then on
 the evening of 
the twenty-fourt
"h, the first
an"
d chief action o
f the battle of 
Borodinó was al
ready lost on th
e twenty-fourth
", and obviously "
led to the loss 
of the one fough
t on the twenty
-sixth.  After
 the loss of the
 Shevárdino Red
"oubt, we found o"
urselves on the 
 morning of the 
twenty-fifth wit
hout a position 
for our left fla
"nk, and
were fo"
rced to bend it 
back and hastily
 entrench it whe
re it chanced to
 be.  Not onl
y was the Russia
n army on the tw
enty-sixth defen
"ded by weak,
un"
finished entrenc
"hments, but the "
disadvantage of 
that position wa
s increased by 
the fact that th
e Russian comman
ders—not havin
g fully realize
d what had happe
"ned, namely the "
loss of our posi
tion on the left
 flank and the 
shifting of the 
whole field of t
he forthcoming b
attle from righ
t to left—main
tained their ext
ended position f
rom the village 
of Nóvoe to Ut
"ítsa, and conse"
quently had to m
ove their forces
 from right to 
left during the 
battle. So it ha
ppened that thro
ughout the whole
 battle the Rus
sians opposed th
e entire French 
army launched ag
ainst our left 
flank with but h
alf as many men.
 (Poniatowski’
s action against
" Utítsa,
and U"
várov’s on th
e right flank ag
ainst the French
", were actions
"
distinct from th
e main course of
 the battle.) So
 the battle of B
orodinó did no
t take place at 
all as (in an ef
fort to conceal 
our commanders�
� mistakes even
 at the cost of 
diminishing the 
glory due to the
 Russian army a
nd people) it ha
s been described
. The battle of 
Borodinó was no
t fought on a c
hosen and entren
ched position wi
th forces only s
lightly weaker 
than those of th
"e enemy, but, as"
 a result of the
 loss of the Sh
evárdino Redoub
"t, the Russians "
fought the battl
e of Borodinó o
n an open and a
lmost unentrench
"ed position, wit"
h forces only ha
lf as numerous 
as the French; t
"hat is to say, u"
nder conditions 
in which it was 
not merely unth
inkable to fight
 for ten hours a
nd secure an ind
"ecisive
result,"
 but unthinkable
 to keep an army
 even from compl
ete disintegrat
ion and flight. 
      CHAPT
ER XX  On the 
morning of the t
wenty-fifth Pier
re was leaving M
ozháysk. At the
 descent of the
 high steep hill
", down which a w"
inding road led 
out of the town
 past the cathed
ral on the right
", where a servic"
e was being held
 and the bells 
"were ringing, Pi"
erre got out of 
his vehicle and 
proceeded on fo
ot. Behind him a
 cavalry regimen
t was coming dow
n the hill prece
ded by its sing
ers. Coming up t
oward him was a 
train of carts c
arrying men who 
 had been wounde
d in the engagem
ent the day befo
re. The peasant 
"drivers,
shouti"
ng and lashing t
"heir horses, kep"
t crossing from 
side to side. Th
"e
carts, in eac"
h of which three
 or four wounded
 soldiers were l
ying or sitting
", jolted over th"
e stones that ha
d been thrown on
 the steep incl
ine to make it s
omething like a 
road. The wounde
"d, bandaged with"
"
rags, with pal"
"e cheeks, compre"
"ssed lips, and k"
"nitted brows, he"
ld on to the si
des of the carts
 as they were jo
lted against one
 another. Almost
 all of them st
ared with naïve
", childlike curi"
osity at Pierre�
��s white hat a
nd green swallow
-tail coat.  P
ierre’s coachm
an shouted angri
ly at the convoy
 of wounded to k
eep to one side
 of the road. Th
e cavalry regime
"nt, as it descen"
ded the hill wi
"th its singers, "
surrounded Pierr
e’s carriage a
nd blocked the r
oad. Pierre sto
"pped, being pres"
sed against the 
side of the cutt
ing in which th
e road ran. The 
sunshine from be
hind the hill di
d not penetrate 
into the cuttin
g and there it w
as cold and damp
", but above Pier"
re’s head was 
 the bright Augu
st sunshine and 
the bells sounde
d merrily. One o
f the carts wit
h wounded stoppe
d by the side of
 the road close 
to Pierre. The 
driver in his ba
st shoes ran pan
"ting up to it, p"
laced a stone un
der one of its 
tireless hind wh
"eels, and began "
arranging the br
eech-band on his
 little horse. 
  One of the wo
"unded, an old so"
ldier with a ban
daged arm who wa
s following the
" cart on foot, c"
aught hold of it
 with his sound 
hand and turned 
to look at Pier
"re.

“I say,"
 fellow countrym
an! Will they se
t us down here o
r take us on to 
 Moscow?” he a
sked.  Pierre 
was so deep in t
hought that he d
id not hear the 
question. He was
 looking now at
 the cavalry reg
iment that had m
et the convoy of
" wounded,
now a"
t the cart by wh
ich he was stand
"ing, in which tw"
o wounded men w
ere sitting and 
one was lying. O
ne of those sitt
ing up in the ca
rt had probably
 been wounded in
 the cheek. His 
whole head was w
rapped in rags 
and one cheek wa
s swollen to the
 size of a baby�
��s head. His no
se and mouth we
re twisted to on
e side. This sol
dier was looking
 at the cathedr
al and crossing 
himself. Another
", a young lad, a"
 fair-haired re
cruit as white a
s though there w
as no blood in h
"is thin face, lo"
oked at Pierre 
"kindly, with a f"
ixed smile. The 
third lay prone 
so that his fac
e was not visibl
e. The cavalry s
ingers were pass
ing close by:  
"
   Ah lost, qui"
te lost... is my
" head so keen,
"
   Living in a f
oreign land... 
 they sang thei
r soldiers’ da
nce song.  As 
if responding to
 them but with a
 different sort 
"of merriment, th"
e metallic soun
d of the bells r
everberated high
 above and the h
ot rays of the 
sun bathed the t
op of the opposi
te slope with ye
t another sort o
f merriment. Bu
t beneath the sl
"ope, by the cart"
 with the wounde
d near the pant
ing little nag w
here Pierre stoo
"d, it was damp, "
"somber, and sad."
  The soldier 
with the swollen
 cheek looked an
grily at the cav
alry singers. 
"
“Oh, the cox"
combs!” he mut
tered reproachfu
lly.  “It’
s not the soldie
"rs only, but I�"
�ve seen peasant
"s today, too...."
 The peasants�
�even they have 
"to go,” said t"
he soldier behin
"d the cart,
add"
ressing Pierre w
ith a sad smile.
 “No distincti
ons made nowaday
s.... They want
 the whole natio
n to fall on the
"m—in a word, i"
t’s Moscow! Th
ey want to make
 an end of it.�
�  In spite of
 the obscurity o
f the soldier’
s words Pierre u
nderstood what 
he wanted to say
 and nodded appr
oval.  The roa
d was clear agai
n; Pierre descen
ded the hill and
 drove on.  He
 kept looking to
 either side of 
the road for fam
"iliar faces, but"
 only saw every
where the unfami
liar faces of va
rious military m
en of different 
 branches of the
" service, who al"
l looked with as
tonishment at hi
s white hat and
 green tail coat
.  Having gone
 nearly three mi
les he at last m
et an acquaintan
ce and eagerly 
addressed him. T
his was one of t
he head army doc
tors. He was dr
iving toward Pie
rre in a covered
" gig, sitting be"
side a young sur
"geon,
and on re"
cognizing Pierre
 he told the Cos
sack who occupie
d the driver’s
 seat to pull u
p.  “Count! 
"Your excellency,"
 how come you to
 be here?” ask
ed the doctor. 
"
“Well, you k"
"now, I wanted to"
 see...”  �
"�Yes, yes, there"
 will be somethi
ng to see....”
  Pierre got o
ut and talked to
" the doctor, exp"
laining his inte
ntion of taking
 part in a battl
e.  The doctor
 advised him to 
apply direct to 
Kutúzov.  “
Why should you b
e God knows wher
"e out of sight, "
during the battl
"e?” he
said, "
exchanging glanc
es with his youn
g companion. “
Anyhow his Seren
e Highness know
s you and will r
eceive you graci
ously. That’s 
what you must d
o.”  The doc
tor seemed tired
 and in a hurry.
  “You think
" so?... Ah, I al"
so wanted to ask
 you where our p
osition is exac
tly?” said Pie
rre.  “The p
osition?” repe
ated the doctor.
" “Well, that�"
�s not my line. 
Drive past Tat�
"�rinova, a lot o"
f digging is goi
ng on there. Go 
up the hillock 
and you’ll see
.”  “Can o
ne see from ther
e?... If you wou
ld...”  But 
the doctor inter
rupted him and m
oved toward his 
gig.  “I wou
ld go with you b
ut on my honor I
’m up to here�
��—and he poin
ted to his thro
at. “I’m gal
loping to the co
mmander of the c
orps. How do mat
ters stand?... 
"You know, Count,"
 there’ll be a
 battle tomorrow
. Out of an army
 of a hundred t
housand we must 
expect at least 
twenty thousand 
"wounded,
and we"
 haven’t stret
"chers, or bunks,"
" or dressers, or"
 doctors enough 
for six thousan
d. We have ten t
"housand carts, b"
ut we need other
 things as well
—we must manag
e as best we can
!”  The stra
nge thought that
 of the thousand
"s of men, young "
"and old, who
ha"
d stared with me
rry surprise at 
his hat (perhaps
 the very men he
" had
noticed), "
twenty thousand 
were inevitably 
doomed to wounds
 and death amaz
ed Pierre.  �
�They may die to
morrow; why are 
they thinking of
 anything but de
ath?” And by 
some latent sequ
ence of thought 
the descent of t
he Mozháysk hil
"l,
the carts wi"
"th the wounded, "
the ringing bell
"s, the slanting "
rays of the sun
", and the songs "
of the cavalryme
n vividly recurr
ed to his mind. 
  “The cavalr
y ride to battle
 and meet the wo
unded and do not
 for a moment t
hink of what awa
"its them, but pa"
"ss by, winking a"
t the wounded. Y
et from among t
hese men twenty 
thousand are doo
"med to die, and "
they wonder at m
y hat! Strange!
” thought Pier
"re, continuing h"
is way to Tatár
inova.  In fro
nt of a landowne
r’s house to t
he left of the r
oad stood carria
"ges,
wagons, an"
d crowds of orde
rlies and sentin
els. The command
er in chief was
 putting up ther
"e, but just when"
 Pierre arrived 
he was not in an
d hardly any of
 the staff were 
there—they had
 gone to the chu
rch service. Pi
erre drove on to
ward Górki.  
When he had asce
nded the hill an
d reached the li
ttle village str
"eet, he
saw for"
 the first time 
peasant militiam
en in their whit
e shirts and wit
h crosses on th
"eir caps, who, t"
alking and laugh
"ing loudly, anim"
ated and perspi
"ring, were at wo"
rk on a huge kno
ll overgrown wit
h grass to the 
right of the roa
d.  Some of th
"em were digging,"
 others were whe
eling barrowload
s of earth alon
"g planks, while "
others stood abo
ut doing nothing
.  Two officer
s were standing 
"on the knoll, di"
recting the men.
 On seeing thes
"e peasants, who "
were evidently s
till amused by t
he novelty of th
eir position as
" soldiers, Pierr"
e once more thou
ght of the wound
ed men at Mozh�
�ysk and underst
ood what the sol
dier had meant w
hen he said: “
They want the w
hole nation to f
all on them.” 
The sight of the
se bearded peas
ants at work on 
"the battlefield,"
 with their quee
"r, clumsy boots"
 and perspiring 
"necks, and their"
 shirts opening 
from the left to
ward the middle
", unfastened, ex"
posing their sun
burned collarbon

P"
ierre more stron

en or heard.  
    CHAPTER 
XXI  Pierre st
epped out of his
" carriage and, p"
assing the toili
"ng militiamen,
"
ascended the kno
"ll from which, a"
ccording to the 
"doctor, the batt"
lefield could b
e seen.  It wa
s about eleven o
’clock. The su
n shone somewhat
 to the left and
 behind him and
 brightly lit up
 the enormous pa
"norama which, ri"
sing like an am
"phitheater, exte"
nded before him 
in the clear rar
efied atmosphere
.  From above 
"on the left, bis"
ecting that amph
"itheater, wound "
the Smolénsk h
"ighroad, passing"
 through a villa
ge with a white 
church some five
 hundred paces 
in front of the 
knoll and below 
it. This was Bor
odinó. Below t
he village the r
oad crossed the 
river by a bridg
"e and, winding
"
"down and up, ros"
e higher and hig
her to the villa
ge of Valúevo v
isible about fo
"ur miles away, w"
here Napoleon wa
s then stationed
. Beyond Valúev
o the road disa
ppeared into a y
ellowing forest 
on the horizon. 
Far in the dist
ance in that bir
ch and fir fores
t to the right o
"f the road, the"
 cross and belfr
y of the Koloch�
� Monastery glea
med in the sun. 
Here and there 
over the whole o
f that blue expa
"nse, to right an"
d left of the f
orest and the ro
"ad, smoking camp"
fires could be s
een and indefini
te masses of tr
oops—ours and 
the enemy’s. T
he ground to the
 right—along t
he course of th
e Kolochá and M
oskvá rivers—
was broken and h
illy. Between t
he hollows the v
illages of Bezú
bova and Zakhár
ino showed in th
e distance. On 
the left the gro
und was more lev
el; there were f
"ields of
grain,"
 and the smoking
 ruins of Semën
"ovsk, which had "
been burned down
",
could be seen"
.  All that Pi
erre saw was so 
indefinite that 
neither the left
 nor the right 
side of the fiel
d fully satisfie
d his expectatio
ns. Nowhere cou
ld he see the ba
ttlefield he had
 expected to fin
"d, but only fiel"
"ds,
meadows, tr"
"oops, woods, the"
 smoke of campfi
"res, villages, m"
"ounds, and
stre"
ams; and try as 
he would he coul
d descry no mili
tary “position
” in this pla
ce which teemed 
"with life, nor c"
ould he even dis
tinguish our tr
oops from the en
emy’s.  “I
 must ask someon
"e who knows,” "
"he thought, and "
addressed an off
icer who was lo
oking with curio
sity at his huge
 unmilitary figu
re.  “May I 
"ask you,” said"
" Pierre, “what"
 village that is
 in front?”  
"
“Búrdino, is"
n’t it?” sai
"d the officer, t"
urning to his co
mpanion.  “B
"orodinó,” the"
 other corrected
 him.  The off
"icer, evidently "
glad of an oppor
tunity for a tal
"k, moved up to
"
Pierre.  “Ar
e those our men 
there?” Pierre
 inquired.  �
"�Yes, and there,"
" further on, are"
" the French,” "
said the officer
. “There they
" are, there... y"
ou can see them.
”  “Where?
 Where?” asked
 Pierre.  “O
ne can see them 
with the naked e
"ye... Why, there"
!”  The offi
cer pointed with
 his hand to the
 smoke visible o
n the left beyo
"nd the river, an"
d the same stern
 and serious exp
ression that Pie
rre had noticed
 on many of the 
faces he had met
 came into his f
"ace.

“Ah, t"
hose are the Fre
nch! And over th
ere?...” Pierr
e pointed to a k
noll on the lef
"t, near which so"
me troops could 
be seen.  “T
hose are ours.�
"�

“Ah, ours"
! And there?...�
�� Pierre pointe
d to another kno
ll in the dista
nce with a big t
"ree on it, near "
a village that l
ay in a hollow 
where also some 
campfires were s
moking and somet
hing black was v
isible.  “Th
at’s his again
",” said the of"
ficer. (It was t
he Shevárdino R
edoubt.) “It 
was ours yesterd
"ay, but now it i"
s his.”  “
Then how about o
ur position?” 
  “Our positi
on?” replied t
he officer with 
a smile of satis
faction. “I c
an tell you quit
"e clearly, becau"
se I constructed
 nearly all our 
 entrenchments. 
"There, you see? "
There’s our ce
"nter, at Borodin"
"ó, just
there,"
” and he point
ed to the villag
e in front of th
em with the whit
e church. “Th
at’s where one
 crosses the Kol
ochá. You see d
own there where 
 the rows of hay
 are lying in th
"e hollow, there�"
��s the bridge. 
That’s our ce
nter. Our right 
flank is over th
ere”—he poin
ted sharply to t
"he right,
far a"
way in the broke
n ground—“Th
at’s where the
 Moskvá River i
"s, and
we have "
thrown up three 
"redoubts there, "
very strong ones
. The left flan
k...” here the
 officer paused.
" “Well, you se"
"e, that’s diff"
icult to explai
n.... Yesterday 
our left flank w
as there at Shev
"árdino, you see"
",
where the oak"
" is, but now we "
have withdrawn o
ur left wing—n
ow it is over t
"here, do you see"
 that village an
d the smoke? Tha
t’s Semënovsk
", yes,
there,�"
� he pointed to 
Raévski’s kno
ll. “But the b
attle will hardl
y be there. His
 having moved hi
s troops there i
s only a ruse; h
e will probably
 pass round to t
he right of the 
Moskvá. But whe
"rever it may be,"
 many a man wil
l be missing tom
orrow!” he rem
arked.  An eld
erly sergeant wh
o had approached
 the officer whi
le he was giving
 these explanat
ions had waited 
in silence for h
im to finish spe
"aking, but
at t"
"his point, evide"
ntly not liking 
the officer’s 
"remark, interrup"
ted him.  “
Gabions must be 
"sent for,” sai"
d he sternly.  
 The officer app
"eared abashed, a"
s though he unde
rstood that one 
might think of 
how many men wou
ld be missing to
morrow but ought
 not to speak o
f it.  “Well
", send number th"
ree company agai
"n,” the office"
r replied hurrie
dly.  “And y
"ou, are you one "
of the doctors?�
"��

“No, I�"
�ve come on my o
"wn,” answered "
"Pierre, and he w"
ent down the hil
"l
again, passin"
g the militiamen
".

“Oh, thos"
e damned fellows
!” muttered th
e officer who fo
"llowed him,
hol"
ding his nose as
 he ran past the
 men at work.  
 “There they a
re... bringing h
"er, coming... Th"
ere they are... 
They’ll be he
re in a minute..
.” voices were
 suddenly heard 
saying; and offi
"cers,
soldiers,"
 and militiamen 
began running fo
rward along the 
road.  A churc
h procession was
 coming up the h
ill from Borodin
ó. First along 
 the dusty road 
came the infantr
"y in ranks, bare"
headed and with 
arms reversed. 
From behind them
 came the sound 
of church singin
g.  Soldiers a
nd militiamen ra
n bareheaded pas
t Pierre toward 
the procession.
  “They are 
"bringing her, ou"
r Protectress!..
. The Iberian Mo
ther of God!” 
 someone cried. 
  “The Smolé
nsk Mother of Go
"d,” another co"
rrected him.  
"The militiamen, "
both those who h
ad been in the v
illage and those
 who had been a
t work on the ba
"ttery, threw dow"
n their spades a
nd ran to meet t
he church proce
ssion. Following
 the battalion t
hat marched alon
g the dusty roa
d came priests i
n their vestment
s—one little o
ld man in a hood
 with attendant
s and singers. B
ehind them soldi
ers and officers
" bore a large,
"
dark-faced icon 
with an embossed
 metal cover. Th
is was the icon 
that had been b
rought from Smol
énsk and had si
nce accompanied 
the army. Behind
",
before, and o"
"n both sides, cr"
owds of militiam
en with bared he
"ads walked,
ran"
", and bowed to t"
he ground.  At
 the summit of t
he hill they sto
pped with the ic
on; the men who 
had been holdin
g it up by the l
inen bands attac
hed to it were r
elieved by othe
"rs, the chanters"
 relit their cen
"sers, and servic"
e began. The hot
 rays of the su
n beat down vert
ically and a fre
sh soft wind pla
yed with the ha
ir of the bared 
heads and with t
he ribbons decor
ating the icon. 
 The singing did
 not sound loud 
under the open s
ky. An immense c
rowd of barehea
"ded officers, so"
"ldiers, and mili"
tiamen surrounde
d the icon. Beh
ind the priest a
nd a chanter sto
od the notabilit
ies on a spot r
eserved for them
. A bald general
 with a St. Geor
ge’s Cross on 
his neck stood 
just behind the 
"priest’s back,"
 and without cro
ssing himself (h
e was evidently
 a German) patie
ntly awaited the
 end of the serv
"ice, which
he c"
onsidered it nec
essary to hear t
"o the end, proba"
bly to arouse th
e patriotism of
 the Russian peo
ple. Another gen
eral stood in a 
"martial
pose, c"
rossing himself 
by shaking his h
and in front of 
his chest while
 looking about h
im. Standing amo
ng the crowd of 
"peasants, Pierre"
 recognized sev
eral acquaintanc
es among these n
"otables, but did"
 not look at th
em—his whole a
ttention was abs
orbed in watchin
g the serious e
xpression on the
 faces of the cr
owd of soldiers 
and militiamen w
ho were all gaz
ing eagerly at t
he icon. As soon
 as the tired ch
"anters, who were"
 singing the se
rvice for the tw
entieth time tha
"t day, began laz"
ily and mechani
cally to sing: �
��Save from cala
mity Thy servant
"s, O Mother of
"
"God,” and the "
priest and deaco
n chimed in: “
For to Thee unde
r God we all fl
ee as to an invi
olable bulwark a
"nd protection,�"
� there again ki
ndled in all th
ose faces the sa
me expression of
 consciousness o
f the solemnity 
 of the impendin
g moment that Pi
erre had seen on
 the faces at th
e foot of the h
ill at Mozháysk
 and momentarily
 on many and man
y faces he had m
et that morning
; and heads were
 bowed more freq
uently and hair 
"tossed back,
an"
d sighs and the 
sound men made a
s they crossed t
hemselves were h
eard.  The cro
wd round the ico
n suddenly parte
d and pressed ag
ainst Pierre. S
"omeone, a very i"
mportant persona
ge judging by th
e haste with whi
ch way was made
" for him, was ap"
proaching the ic
on.  It was Ku
"túzov, who had "
been riding roun
d the position a
nd on his way b
ack to Tatárino
va had stopped w
here the service
 was being held.
 Pierre recogni
zed him at once 
by his peculiar 
"figure, which di"
stinguished him 
 from everybody 
else.  With a 
long overcoat on
 his exceedingly
" stout, round-sh"
"ouldered body,
"
with uncovered w
hite head and pu
ffy face showing
 the white ball 
of the eye he h
"ad lost, Kutúzo"
v walked with pl
"unging, swaying "
gait into the c
rowd and stopped
 behind the prie
st. He crossed h
imself with an 
accustomed movem
"ent, bent till h"
e touched the gr
ound with his ha
"nd, and
bowed h"
is white head wi
th a deep sigh. 
Behind Kutúzov 
was Bennigsen an
d the suite. De
spite the presen
ce of the comman
"der in chief, wh"
o attracted the
 attention of al
l the superior o
"fficers, the mil"
itiamen and sold
iers continued 
their prayers wi
thout looking at
 him.  When th
e service was ov
"er, Kutúzov ste"
pped up to the i
"con, sank heavil"
"y
to his knees,"
 bowed to the gr
"ound, and for a "
long time tried 
"vainly to
rise,"
 but could not d
o so on account 
of his weakness 
and weight. His 
 white head twit
ched with the ef
fort. At last he
" rose, kissed th"
e icon as a chi
ld does with na�
�vely pouting li
"ps, and again bo"
wed till he touc
hed the ground 
with his hand. T
he other general
s followed his e
"xample,
then th"
"e officers, and "
after them with 
"excited faces, p"
ressing on one 
"another, crowdin"
"g, panting, and "
"pushing, scrambl"
ed the soldiers 
and militiamen.
      CHAP
TER XXII  Stag
gering amid the 
"crush, Pierre lo"
oked about him. 
  “Count Pete
r Kirílovich! H
ow did you get h
ere?” said a v
oice.  Pierre 
looked round. Bo
rís Drubetskóy
", brushing his k"
nees with his ha
nd (he had prob
ably soiled them
" when he, too, h"
ad knelt before 
"the icon),
came"
 up to him smili
ng. Borís was e
legantly dressed
", with a slightl"
y martial touch
 appropriate to 
a campaign. He w
ore a long coat 
and like Kutúz
ov had a whip sl
ung across his s
houlder.  Mean
while Kutúzov h
ad reached the v
illage and seate
d himself in the
 shade of the n
"earest house, on"
 a bench which o
ne Cossack had r
un to fetch and
 another had has
tily covered wit
h a rug. An imme
nse and brillia
nt suite surroun
ded him.  The 
icon was carried
" further, accomp"
anied by the thr
ong. Pierre stop
ped some thirty
 paces from Kut�
"�zov, talking to"
 Borís.  He e
xplained his wis
h to be present 
at the battle an
d to see the po
sition.  “Th
is is what you m
"ust do,” said "
Borís. “I wil
l do the honors 
of the camp to 
you. You will se
e everything bes
t from where Cou
nt Bennigsen wi
ll be. I am in a
ttendance on him
", you know; I’"
ll mention it to
 him. But if yo
u want to ride r
ound the positio
"n, come along wi"
th us. We are j
ust going to the
 left flank. The
n when we get ba
"ck, do spend the"
 night with me 
and we’ll arra
nge a game of ca
rds. Of course y
ou know Dmítri 
 Sergéevich? Th
ose are his quar
"ters,” and he "
pointed to the t
hird house in t
he village of G�
�rki.  “But 
I should like to
 see the right f
lank. They say i
t’s very stron
"g,”
said Pier"
re. “I should 
like to start fr
om the Moskvá R
iver and ride r
ound the whole p
osition.”  �
"��Well, you can "
"do that later, b"
ut the chief thi
ng is the left f
lank.”  “Y
"es, yes. But whe"
re is Prince Bol
kónski’s regi
ment? Can you po
int it out to m
e?”  “Prin
ce Andrew’s? W
e shall pass it 
and I’ll take 
you to him.” 
 “What about 
the left flank?�
�� asked Pierre 
  “To tell yo
"u the truth, bet"
"ween ourselves, "
God only knows w
hat state our l
"eft flank is in,"
” said Borís 
confidentially l
owering his voic
e. “It is not
 at all what Cou
nt Bennigsen int
ended. He meant 
to fortify that 
knoll quite dif
"ferently, but..."
” Borís shrug
ged his shoulder
"s, “his Serene"
 Highness would
" not have it, or"
 someone persuad
ed him. You see.
..” but Borí
s did not finish
", for at that mo"
"ment Kaysárov, "
Kutúzov’s adj
"utant,
came up "
to Pierre. “Ah
", Kaysárov!” "
"said Borís, add"
ressing him with
 an unembarrass
"ed smile, “I w"
as just trying t
o explain our po
sition to the c
ount. It is amaz
ing how his Sere
ne Highness coul
d so foresee the
 intentions of 
the French!” 
 “You mean th
e left flank?”
 asked Kaysárov
".

“Yes, exa"
ctly; the left f
lank is now extr
emely strong.”
  Though Kutú
zov had dismisse
d all unnecessar
y men from the s
"taff, Borís
ha"
d contrived to r
emain at headqua
rters after the 
changes. He had 
 established him
self with Count 
"Bennigsen, who, "
like all on whom
 Borís had bee
"n in attendance,"
 considered youn
g Prince Drubets
kóy an invaluab
le man.  In t
he higher comman
d there were two
 sharply defined
 parties: Kutúz
ov’s party an
d that of Bennig
"sen, the chief o"
f staff. Borís 
belonged to the 
 latter and no o
"ne else, while s"
howing servile r
espect to Kutúz
"ov, could
so cr"
eate an impressi
on that the old 
fellow was not m
uch good and tha
t Bennigsen man
aged everything.
 Now the decisiv
e moment of batt
le had come whe
n Kutúzov would
 be destroyed an
d the power pass
" to Bennigsen, o"
r even if Kutú
zov won the batt
le it would be f
elt that everyth
ing was done by 
 Bennigsen. In a
ny case many gre
at rewards would
 have to be give
n for tomorrow�
"��s action, and "
new men would co
me to the front.
 So Borís was 
full of nervous 
vivacity all day
.  After Kays�
"�rov, others who"
m Pierre knew ca
"me up to him, an"
d he had not ti
me to reply to a
ll the questions
 about Moscow th
at were showered
" upon
him, or t"
o listen to all 
that was told hi
m. The faces all
 expressed anim
ation and appreh
"ension, but it s"
eemed to Pierre 
that the cause o
f the excitemen
t shown in some 
of these faces l
ay chiefly in qu

"s mind, however,"
 was occupied by
 the different 
expression he sa
w on other faces
—an expression
 that spoke not 
of personal mat
ters but of the 
universal questi
ons of life and 
death. Kutúzov
 noticed Pierre�
��s figure and t
he group gathere
d round him.  
“Call him to m
"e,” said Kutú"
zov.  An adjut
ant told Pierre 
of his Serene Hi
"ghness’ wish, "
and Pierre went 
 toward Kutúzov
’s bench. But 
a militiaman got
 there before hi
m. It was Dólo
khov.  “How 
did that fellow 
get here?” ask
ed Pierre.  �
�He’s a creatu
re that wriggles
 in anywhere!”
 was the answer.
 “He has been
" degraded, you k"
now. Now he want
s to bob up agai
n. He’s been 
proposing some s
cheme or other a
nd has crawled i
nto the enemy’
s picket line a
t night.... He�
�s a brave fello
w.”  Pierre 
took off his hat
 and bowed respe
ctfully to Kutú
zov.  “I con
cluded that if I
 reported to you
r Serene Highnes
s you might send
 me away or say
 that you knew w
hat I was report
"ing, but then I "
shouldn’t los
e anything...”
 Dólokhov was s
aying.  “Yes
", yes.”

“"
But if I were ri
"ght, I should be"
 rendering a ser
vice to my Fathe
rland for which
 I am ready to d
ie.”  “Yes
", yes.”

“"
And should your 
Serene Highness 
require a man wh
o will not spare
" his
skin, plea"
se think of me..
.. Perhaps I may
 prove useful to
 your Serene Hi
ghness.”  �
�Yes... Yes...�
� Kutúzov repea
"ted, his laughin"
g eye narrowing 
more and more a
s he looked at P
ierre.  Just t
"hen Borís, with"
 his courtierlik
"e adroitness, st"
epped up to Pie
rre’s side nea
r Kutúzov and i
n a most natural
" manner, without"
 raising his vo
"ice, said to Pie"
"rre, as though c"
ontinuing an int
errupted conver
sation:  “Th
e militia have p
ut on clean whit
e shirts to be r
eady to die. Wha
"t
heroism, Coun"
t!”  Borís 
evidently said t
his to Pierre in
 order to be ove
rheard by his S
erene Highness. 
He knew Kutúzov
’s attention w
ould be caught b
"y those
words, "
and so it was. 
 “What are yo
u saying about t
he militia?” h
e asked Borís. 
  “Preparing 
"for tomorrow, yo"
ur Serene Highne
ss—for death�
�they have put o
n clean shirts.
”  “Ah... 
"a wonderful, a m"
atchless people!
” said Kutúzo
v; and he closed
 his eyes and s
wayed his head. 
“A matchless p
eople!” he rep
eated with a sig
h.  “So you 
want to smell gu
npowder?” he s
aid to Pierre. �
"��Yes, it’s a"
 pleasant smell.
 I have the hono
r to be one of y
our wife’s ado
rers. Is she we
ll? My quarters 
are at your serv
ice.”  And a
s often happens 
"with old people,"
 Kutúzov began 
looking about a
bsent-mindedly a
s if forgetting 
all he wanted to
 say or do.  T
"hen, evidently r"
emembering what 
"he wanted, he be"
ckoned to Andrew
"
Kaysárov, his"
 adjutant’s br
other.  “Tho
se verses... tho
se verses of Má
rin’s... how d
"o they go, eh? T"
hose he wrote a
bout Gerákov: �
��Lectures for t

g’... Recite t
"hem,

"m!” said he, e"
vidently prepari
ng to laugh.  
Kaysárov recite
d.... Kutúzov s
milingly nodded 
his head to the 
rhythm of the v
erses.  When P
ierre had left K
"utúzov, Dólokh"
ov came up to hi
m and took his h
and.  “I am 
very glad to mee
"t you here, Coun"
"t,” he said al"
"oud, regardless"
 of the presence
 of strangers an
d in a particula
rly resolute and
 solemn tone. �
��On the eve of 
a day when God a
lone knows who o
f us is fated to
"

glad of this opp
ortunity to tell
 you that I regr
et the misunder
standings that o
ccurred between 
us and should wi
sh you not to h
ave any ill feel
ing for me. I be
g you to forgive
 me.”  Pierr
e looked at Dól
okhov with a smi
"le, not knowing "
what to say to h
im. With tears 
in his eyes Dól
okhov embraced P
ierre and kissed
 him.  Borís 
said a few words
" to his general,"
 and Count Benni
gsen turned to 
Pierre and propo
sed that he shou
ld ride with him
 along the line.
  “It will i
"nterest you,” "
said he.  “Y
"es, very much,�"
� replied Pierre
.  Half an hou
r later Kutúzov
 left for Tatár
"inova, and Benni"
gsen and his su
"ite, with Pierre"
" among them, set"
 out on their ri
de along the lin
e.      CH
APTER XXIII  F
"rom Górki, Benn"
igsen descended 
the highroad to 
the bridge which
", when
they had"
 looked at it fr
"om the hill, the"
 officer had poi
nted out as bei
ng the center of
 our position an
d where rows of 
fragrant new-mow
n hay lay by th
e riverside. The
y rode across th
at bridge into t
he village of B
orodinó and the
nce turned to th
"e left, passing "
an enormous numb
er of troops an
"d guns, and came"
 to a high knoll
 where militiame
n were digging. 
 This was the re
"doubt, as yet un"
"named, which aft"
erwards became k
nown as the Ra�
"�vski Redoubt, o"
r the Knoll Batt
"ery, but Pierre "
paid no special 
 attention to it
. He did not kno
w that it would 
become more memo
rable to him th
an any other spo
t on the plain o
f Borodinó.  
They then crosse
d the hollow to 
"Semënovsk, wher"
e the soldiers w
ere dragging aw
ay the last logs
 from the huts a
nd barns. Then t
hey rode downhi
"ll and uphill, a"
cross a ryefield
 trodden and bea
ten down as if b
"y
hail, followi"
ng a track fresh
ly made by the a
rtillery over th
e furrows of th
"e plowed land, a"
nd reached some 
flèches * which
 were still bein
g dug.      *
 A kind of entre
nchment.  At t
he flèches Benn
igsen stopped an
d began looking 
at the Shevárdi
no Redoubt oppo
"site, which had "
been ours the da
y before and whe
re several hors
emen could be de
scried. The offi
cers said that e
ither Napoleon o
r Murat was the
"re, and they all"
 gazed eagerly a
t this little gr
oup of horsemen
. Pierre also lo
"oked at them, tr"
ying to guess wh
ich of the scar
cely discernible
 figures was Nap
oleon. At last t
hose mounted men
 rode away from
 the mound and d
isappeared.  B
ennigsen spoke t
o a general who 
"approached him, "
and began explai
ning the whole 
position of our 
troops. Pierre l
"istened to him, "
straining each 
faculty to under
stand the essent
ial points of th
e impending batt
"le, but
was mor"
tified to feel t
hat his mental c
apacity was inad
equate for the 
task. He could m
ake nothing of i
t. Bennigsen sto
pped speaking an
"d,
noticing tha"
t Pierre was lis
"tening, suddenly"
 said to him:  
 “I don’t th
ink this interes
ts you?”  �
�On the contrary
 it’s very int
eresting!” rep
lied Pierre not 
quite truthfull
y.  From the f
lèches they rod
e still farther 
"to the left, alo"
ng a road windi
ng through a thi
"ck, low-growing "
birch wood. In t
he middle of the
 wood a brown h
are with white f
eet sprang out a
"nd, scared by th"
e tramp of the 
"many horses, gre"
w so confused th
at it leaped alo
ng the road in f
ront of them fo
"r some time, aro"
using general at
tention and laug
"hter, and only
"
when several voi
ces shouted at i
t did it dart to
 one side and di
sappear in the 
thicket. After g
oing through the
 wood for about 
a mile and a hal
f they came out
 on a glade wher
e troops of Túc
hkov’s corps w
ere stationed t
o defend the lef
t flank.  Here
", at the extreme"
" left flank, Ben"
nigsen talked a 
great deal and w
"ith
much heat, "
"and, as it seeme"
"d to Pierre, gav"
e orders of grea
t military impo
rtance. In front
 of Túchkov’s
 troops was some
 high ground not
 occupied by tr
oops. Bennigsen 
loudly criticize
"d this mistake, "
saying that it 
was madness to l
eave a height wh
ich commanded th
e country around
 unoccupied and
 to place troops
 below it. Some 
of the generals 
expressed the s
ame opinion. One
 in particular d
eclared with mar
tial heat that t
hey were put th
ere to be slaugh
tered. Bennigsen
 on his own auth
ority ordered t
he troops to occ
upy the high gro
und. This dispos
ition on the lef
t flank increas
ed Pierre’s do
ubt of his own c
apacity to under
stand military 
matters. Listeni
ng to Bennigsen 
and the generals
 criticizing the
 position of th
e troops behind 
"the hill, he qui"
te understood th
em and shared t
"heir opinion, bu"
t for that very 
reason he could 
not understand 
how the man who 
put them there b
ehind the hill c
ould have made s
o gross and pal
pable a blunder.
  Pierre did n
ot know that the
se troops were n
"ot, as Bennigsen"
" supposed,
put "
there to defend 
"the position, bu"
t were in a conc
ealed position a
"s
an ambush, th"
at they should n
ot be seen and m
ight be able to 
strike an appro
aching enemy une
xpectedly. Benni
gsen did not kno
w this and moved
 the troops for
ward according t
o his own ideas 
without mentioni
ng the matter t
o the commander 
in chief.    
   CHAPTER XXI
V  On that bri
ght evening of A
"ugust 25, Prince"
 Andrew lay lean
ing on his elbo
w in a broken-do
wn shed in the v
illage of Knyazk
óvo at the furt
her end of his 
regiment’s enc
ampment. Through
 a gap in the br
oken wall he co
"uld see, beside "
the wooden fence
", a row of thirt"
y-year-old birch
es with their l
ower branches lo
"pped off, a fiel"
d on which shock
s of oats were 
"standing, and so"
me bushes near w
hich rose the sm
oke of campfire
s—the soldiers
’ kitchens.  
 Narrow and burd
ensome and usele
ss to anyone as 
his life now see
"med to
him, Pri"
nce Andrew on th
e eve of battle 
felt agitated an
d irritable as 
he had done seve
n years before a
t Austerlitz.  
 He had received
 and given the o
rders for next d
ay’s battle an
d had nothing m
ore to do. But h
is thoughts—th
"e simplest, clea"
"rest, and
there"
fore most terrib
le thoughts—wo
uld give him no 
peace. He knew t
hat tomorrow’
s battle would b
e the most terri
ble of all he ha
d taken part in
", and for the fi"
rst time in his 
life the possibi
lity of death p
resented itself 
to him—not in 
relation to any 
worldly matter o
r with referenc
e to its effect 
"on others, but s"
imply in relatio
"n to himself, to"
 his own soul�
"�vividly, plainl"
"y, terribly, and"
 almost as a cer
tainty. And fro
m the height of 
this perception 
all that had pre
viously tormente
d and preoccupi
ed him suddenly 
became illumined
 by a cold white
 light without 
"shadows, without"
" perspective, wi"
thout distinctio
n of outline. Al
l life appeared
 to him like mag
ic-lantern pictu
res at which he 
had long been g
azing by artific
ial light throug
h a glass. Now h
e suddenly saw t
hose badly daub
ed pictures in c
lear daylight an
d without a glas
"s. “Yes,
yes!"
" There they are,"
 those false ima
ges that agitate
"d, enraptured,
"
and tormented me
",” said he to "
"himself, passing"
 in review the p
rincipal pictur
es of the magic 
lantern of life 
and regarding th
em now in the co
ld white daylig
ht of his clear 
perception of de
ath. “There th
"ey are, those
r"
udely painted fi
gures that once 
seemed splendid 
and mysterious. 
"
Glory, the good"
" of society, lov"
"e of a woman, th"
e Fatherland its
elf—how impor
tant these pictu
res appeared to 
"me, with what pr"
ofound meaning t
hey seemed to b
e filled! And it
 is all so simpl
"e, pale, and cru"
de in the cold 
white light of t
his morning whic
h I feel is dawn
ing for me.” T
he three great 
sorrows of his l
ife held his att
ention in partic
ular: his love 
"for a woman, his"
 father’s deat
"h, and the Frenc"
h invasion which
 had overrun ha
lf Russia. “Lo
ve... that littl
e girl who seeme
d to me brimming
 over with myst
"ic forces! Yes, "
"indeed, I loved "
her. I made roma
ntic plans of l
ove and happines
"s with her! Oh, "
what a boy I was
!” he said alo
ud bitterly. �
�Ah me! I believ
ed in some ideal
 love which was 
to keep her fai
thful to me for 
the whole year o
f my absence! Li
ke the gentle do
ve in the fable
 she was to pine
 apart from me..
.. But it was mu
ch simpler real
ly.... It was al
l very simple an
d horrible.” 
 “When my fat
her built Bald H
ills he thought 
the place was hi
"s: his
land, hi"
"s air, his peasa"
nts. But Napoleo
n came and swept
" him aside,
unc"
onscious of his 
"existence, as he"
 might brush a c
hip from his pat
"h,
and his Bald"
 Hills and his w
hole life fell t
o pieces. Prince
ss Mary says it
 is a trial sent
 from above. Wha
t is the trial f
"or, when he is n"
ot here and wil
l never return? 
He is not here! 
For whom then is
 the trial inte
nded? The Father
"land, the destru"
ction of Moscow!
 And tomorrow I 
 shall be killed
", perhaps not ev"
en by a Frenchma
n but by one of 
"our own
men, by"
 a soldier disch
arging a musket 
close to my ear 
as one of them 
"did yesterday, a"
nd the French wi
ll come and take
 me by head and 
heels and fling
 me into a hole 
that I may not s
tink under their
" noses, and new"
 conditions of l
"ife will arise, "
which will seem 
quite ordinary t
o others and ab
out which I shal
l know nothing. 
I shall not exis
t....”  He l
ooked at the row
 of birches shin
ing in the sunsh
"ine, with their"
 motionless gree
n and yellow fol
iage and white b
ark. “To die..
. to be killed 
tomorrow... That
 I should not ex
ist... That all 
this should stil
"l
be, but no me"
....”  And t
he birches with 
their light and 
"shade, the curly"
" clouds, the
sm"
oke of the campf
"ires, and all th"
at was around hi
m changed and se
emed terrible a
nd menacing. A c
old shiver ran d
own his spine. H
"e rose
quickly,"
 went out of the
" shed, and began"
 to walk about. 
  After he had 
"returned, voices"
 were heard outs
ide the shed. �
�Who’s that?�
� he cried.  
The red-nosed Ca
"ptain Timókhin,"
 formerly Dólok
hov’s squadron
" commander,
but"
 now from lack o
f officers a bat
talion commander
", shyly entered "
the shed follow
ed by an adjutan
t and the regime
ntal paymaster. 
  Prince Andrew
" rose hastily, l"
istened to the b
usiness they had
" come
about, ga"
ve them some fur
ther instruction
"s, and was about"
 to dismiss the
m when he heard 
"a familiar, lisp"
"ing, voice behin"
d the shed.  �
��Devil take it!
” said the voi
ce of a man stum
bling over somet
hing.  Prince 
Andrew looked ou
t of the shed an
"d saw Pierre, wh"
o had tripped o
ver a pole on th
e ground and had
" nearly fallen, "
coming his way. 
It was unpleasa
nt to Prince And
rew to meet peop
le of his own se
"t in general,
a"
nd Pierre especi
"ally, for he rem"
inded him of all
 the painful mom
ents of his las
t visit to Mosco
w.  “You? Wh
at a surprise!�
� said he. “Wh
at brings you he
re? This is une
xpected!”  A
s he said this h
is eyes and face
 expressed more 
than coldness—
they expressed 
"hostility, which"
 Pierre noticed 
at once. He had 
approached the 
shed full of ani
"mation, but on s"
eeing Prince And
rew’s face he 
felt constraine
d and ill at eas
e.  “I have 
come... simply..
. you know... co
me... it interes
"ts me,” said
"
"Pierre, who had "
so often that da
y senselessly re
peated that word
 “interesting

o see the battle
.”  “Oh ye
"s, and what do t"
he Masonic broth
ers say about wa
r? How would the
y stop it?” s
aid Prince Andre
w sarcastically.
" “Well, and ho"
w’s Moscow? An
d my people? Ha
ve they reached 
Moscow at last?�
�� he asked seri
ously.  “Yes
", they have. Jul"
ie Drubetskáya 
told me so. I we
"nt to see them, "
but missed them
. They have gone
 to your estate 
near Moscow.” 
      CHAPT
ER XXV  The of
ficers were abou
"t to take leave,"
 but Prince Andr
"ew, apparently
"
reluctant to be 
left alone with 
"his friend, aske"
d them to stay a
nd have tea. Se
ats were brought
 in and so was t
he tea. The offi
cers gazed with 
 surprise at Pie
rre’s huge sto
ut figure and li
stened to his ta
lk of Moscow an
d the position o
"f our army, roun"
d which he had r
idden. Prince A
ndrew remained s
"ilent, and his e"
xpression was so
 forbidding that
 Pierre address
ed his remarks c
hiefly to the go
od-natured batta
lion commander. 
  “So you und
erstand the whol
e position of ou
r troops?” Pri
nce Andrew inte
rrupted him.  
“Yes—that is
", how do you mea"
n?” said Pierr
e. “Not being 
a military man 
I can’t say I 
have understood 
"it fully, but I "
understand the g
eneral position
".”

“Well,"
" then, you know "
more than anyone
" else, be it who"
" it may,” said"
 Prince Andrew.
  “Oh!” sa
"id Pierre, looki"
ng over his spec
tacles in perple
xity at Prince 
"Andrew. “Well,"
 and what do you
 think of Kutúz
ov’s appointme
nt?” he asked
.  “I was ve
ry glad of his a
"ppointment, that"
"’s all I know,"
” replied Prin
ce Andrew.  �
��And tell me yo
ur opinion of Ba
rclay de Tolly. 
In Moscow they a
re saying heave
n knows what abo
ut him.... What 
do you think of 
him?”  “As
"k them,” repli"
ed Prince Andrew
", indicating the"
 officers.  Pi
erre looked at T
imókhin with th
e condescendingl
y interrogative 
smile with whic
h everybody invo
luntarily addres
sed that officer
.  “We see l
"ight again, sinc"
e his Serenity h

"ókhin timidly, "
and continually 
turning to glanc

".

“Well, to"

�  “Then why
 was it forbidde
n?”  Timókh
in looked about 
"in confusion, no"
t knowing what o
r how to answer 
 such a question
. Pierre put the
 same question t
o Prince Andrew.
"

“Why, so a"
s not to lay was
te the country w
e were abandonin
"g to the
enemy,"
” said Prince 
Andrew with veno
mous irony. “I
t is very sound:
 one can’t pe
rmit the land to
 be pillaged and
 accustom the tr
oops to maraudi
ng. At Smolénsk
 too he judged c
orrectly that th
e French might 
"outflank us, as "
they had larger 
forces. But he c
ould not underst
"and
this,” cr"
ied Prince Andre
w in a shrill vo
ice that seemed 
to escape him i
nvoluntarily: �
�he could not un
derstand that th
"ere, for the fir"
"st time,
we wer"
e fighting for R
"ussian soil, and"
 that there was 
a spirit in the 
 men such as I h
ad never seen be
"fore, that we ha"
d held the Frenc
"h for
two days,"
 and that that s
uccess had incre
ased our strengt
h tenfold. He o
rdered us to ret
"reat, and all ou"
r efforts and lo
sses went for no
thing. He had n
o thought of bet
"raying us, he tr"
ied to do the be
"st he could,
he"
 thought out eve
"rything, and tha"
t is why he is u
nsuitable. He is
 unsuitable now
", just because h"
e plans out ever
ything very thor
oughly and accu
rately as every 
German has to. H
ow can I explain
"?... Well, say y"
our father has 
"a German valet, "
and he is a sple
ndid valet and s
atisfies your f
ather’s requir
ements better th
"an you could, th"
en it’s all ri

end to your fath
er with your own
" unpracticed, aw"
"kward hands,
an"
d will soothe hi

skilled man who

uld. So it has 
been with Barcla
y. While Russia 
"was well, a fore"
igner could ser
ve her and be a

still more unju

Pierre.  “I 
don’t understa

�  “But that
"’s impossible,"
” said Prince 
Andrew as if it 
were a matter s
ettled long ago.
  Pierre looke
d at him in surp
rise.  “And 
yet they say tha
t war is like a 
game of chess?�
� he remarked. 
"
“Yes,” rep"
lied Prince Andr
"ew, “but with "
this little diff
"erence, that
in"
 chess you may t
hink over each m
ove as long as y
ou please and ar
e not limited f
"or time, and wit"
h this differenc
"e too, that a kn"
ight is always 
stronger than a 
"pawn, and two pa"
wns are always s
tronger than one
", while
in war "
a battalion is s
ometimes stronge
r than a divisio
n and sometimes 
 weaker than a c
ompany. The rela
tive strength of
 bodies of troop
s can never be 
known to anyone.
" Believe me,” "
"he went on, “i"
f things depend
ed on arrangemen
ts made by the s
"taff, I should b"
e there making

t instead of tha

uccess never dep

" will depend, on"
" position, or eq"

" on numbers,

 “But on what
 then?”  “
On the feeling t
hat is in me and
" in him,” he p"
ointed to Timók
"hin, “and
in "
each soldier.”
  Prince Andre
w glanced at Tim
"ókhin, who look"
ed at his comman
der in alarm an
d bewilderment. 
In contrast to h
is former retice
nt taciturnity 
Prince Andrew no
w seemed excited
. He could appar
ently not refrai
n from expressi
ng the thoughts 
that had suddenl
y occurred to hi
m.  “A battl
e is won by thos
e who firmly res
olve to win it! 
Why did we lose 
 the battle at A
usterlitz? The F
rench losses wer
e almost equal t
"o ours,
but ver"
y early we said 
to ourselves tha
t we were losing
" the battle,
an"
d we did lose it
. And we said so
 because we had 
nothing to fight
" for
there, we "
wanted to get aw
ay from the batt
lefield as soon 
as we could. �
"�We’ve lost, s"
"o let us run,’"
 and we ran. If 
we had not said 
that till the e
"vening, heaven k"
nows what might 
not have happene
d. But tomorrow 
we shan’t say
 it! You talk ab
out our position
", the left flank"
 weak and the r
ight flank too e
"xtended,” he w"
ent on. “That�
��s all nonsense
", there’s
not"
hing of the kind
. But what await
s us tomorrow? A
 hundred million
 most diverse c
hances which wil
l be decided on 
the instant by t
he fact that ou
r men or theirs 
run or do not ru
"n, and that this"
 man or that man
" is
killed, but"
 all that is bei
ng done at prese
nt is only play.
 The fact is th
at those men wit
h whom you have 
ridden round the
 position not on
ly do not help 
"matters, but hin"
der. They are on
ly concerned wit
h their own pet
ty interests.”
  “At such a
 moment?” said
 Pierre reproach
fully.  “At 
such a moment!�
� Prince Andrew 
repeated. “To 
them it is only 
a moment afford
ing opportunitie
s to undermine a
 rival and obtai
n an extra cross
 or ribbon. For
 me tomorrow mea
ns this: a Russi
an army of a hun
dred thousand a
nd a French army
 of a hundred th
ousand have met 
"to fight, and
t"
he thing is that
 these two hundr
ed thousand men 
will fight and t
he side that fi
ghts more fierce
ly and spares it
self least will 
win. And if you 
 like I will tel
l you that whate
ver happens and 
whatever muddles
 those at the t
"op may make, we "
shall win tomorr
ow’s battle. T
"omorrow, happen "
"what

all win!”  �
"��There now, you"

at’s the truth

",” said
Timó"
khin. “Who wou

 now? The soldie

"on,

 wouldn’t drin
k their vodka! �
��It’s not the
 day for that!�
� they say.” 
  All were sile
nt. The officers
 rose. Prince An
drew went out of
 the shed with 
"them, giving fin"
al orders to the
 adjutant. After
 they had gone 
Pierre approache
d Prince Andrew 
and was about to
 start a convers
ation when they
 heard the clatt
er of three hors
es’ hoofs on t
he road not far 
"
from the shed, "
and looking in t
hat direction Pr
ince Andrew reco
gnized Wolzogen
 and Clausewitz 
accompanied by a
 Cossack. They r
ode close by co
ntinuing to conv
"erse, and Prince"
 Andrew involunt
arily heard thes
e words:  “
Der Krieg muss i

t genug Preis g
"eben,” * said "
one of them.  
     * “The wa
r must be extend

not sufficiently
      commend t

"
“Oh, ja,” "
"said the other, "
“der Zweck ist
 nur den Feind z

       * “Oh

f      course o

s.”   “Oh
", no,” agreed "
the other.  �
�Extend widely!�
�� said Prince A
ndrew with an an
"gry snort, when "
they had ridden
 past. “In tha
t ‘extend’ w
"ere my father, s"
"on, and sister, "

That’s all the

 and have now co
me to teach us. 
Fine teachers!�
� and again his
 voice grew shri
ll.  “So you
 think we shall 
win tomorrow’s
 battle?” aske
d Pierre.  “
"Yes, yes,” ans"
wered Prince And
rew absently. �
�One thing I wou
ld do if I had 
"the power,” he"
" began again, �"
�I would not tak
e prisoners. Why
 take prisoners
? It’s chivalr
y! The French ha
ve destroyed my 
home and are on 
 their way to de
"stroy Moscow, th"
ey have outraged
 and are outragi
ng me every mom
ent. They are my
 enemies. In my 
opinion they are
 all criminals. 
 And so thinks T
imókhin and the
 whole army. The
y should be exec
uted! Since the
y are my foes th
ey cannot be my 
"friends, whateve"
r may have been 
 said at Tilsit.
"”

“Yes, y"
"es,” muttered "
"Pierre, looking "
with shining eye
s at Prince Andr
ew. “I quite 
agree with you!�
��  The questi
on that had pert
urbed Pierre on 
the Mozháysk hi
ll and all that
 day now seemed 
to him quite cle
ar and completel
y solved. He now
 understood the
 whole meaning a
nd importance of
 this war and of
 the impending 
battle. All he h
ad seen that day
", all the signif"
icant and stern
 expressions on 
the faces he had
 seen in passing
", were lit up
f"
or him by a new 
light. He unders
tood that latent
 heat (as they s
ay in physics) 
of patriotism wh
ich was present 
in all these men
" he had seen,
a"
nd this explaine
d to him why the
y all prepared f
"or death calmly,"
 and as it were
 lightheartedly.
  “Not take 
"prisoners,” Pr"
ince Andrew cont
inued: “That b
y itself would 
quite change the
 whole war and m
ake it less crue
l. As it is we h
ave played at w
ar—that’s wh
at’s vile! We 
play at magnanim
ity and all that
 stuff. Such ma
gnanimity and se
nsibility are li
ke the magnanimi
ty and sensibil
ity of a lady wh
o faints when sh
e sees a calf be
ing killed: she 
 is so kindheart
ed that she can�
��t look at bloo
"d, but enjoys ea"
ting the calf s
erved up with sa
uce. They talk t
o us of the rule
"s of war, of
ch"
"ivalry, of flags"
" of truce, of me"
rcy to the unfor
tunate and so on
. It’s all ru
bbish! I saw chi
valry and flags 
of truce in 1805
; they humbugged
 us and we humb
ugged them. They
 plunder other p
eople’s houses
", issue
false p"
"aper money, and "
worst of all the
y kill my childr
en and my fathe
"r, and then talk"
 of rules of war
 and magnanimity
 to foes! Take n
"o
prisoners, bu"
t kill and be ki
lled! He who has
 come to this as
 I have through
 the same suffer
ings...”  Pr
"ince Andrew, who"
 had thought it 
was all the same
 to him whether 
or not Moscow w
as taken as Smol
"énsk had been, "
was suddenly che
cked in his spe
ech by an unexpe
cted cramp in hi
s throat. He pac
ed up and down a
 few times in s
"ilence, but his "
eyes glittered f
everishly and hi
s lips quivered
 as he began spe
aking.  “If 
there was none o
f this magnanimi
"ty in war, we sh"
ould go to war o
nly when it was
 worth while goi
ng to certain de
"ath, as now. The"
n there would n
ot be war becaus
e Paul Ivánovic
h had offended M
ichael Ivánovic
h. And when the
"re was a war, li"
"ke this one, it "
would be war! An
d then the dete
rmination of the
 troops would be
 quite different
. Then all these
 Westphalians a
nd Hessians whom
 Napoleon is lea
ding would not f
ollow him into 
"Russia, and we s"
hould not go to 
fight in Austria
 and Prussia wi
thout knowing wh
y. War is not co
urtesy but the m
ost horrible thi
ng in life; and
 we ought to und
erstand that and
 not play at war
. We ought to a
ccept this terri
ble necessity st
ernly and seriou
sly. It all lies
 in that: get r
id of falsehood 
and let war be w
ar and not a gam
e. As it is now
", war is the fav"
orite pastime of
 the idle and fr
ivolous. The mil
itary calling i
s the most highl
y honored.  �
�But what is war
? What is needed
 for success in 
warfare? What ar
e the habits of
 the military? T
he aim of war is
 murder; the met
hods of war are
" spying, treache"
"ry, and their en"
"couragement, the"
 ruin of a count
ry’s inhabita
"nts, robbing the"
m or stealing to
 provision the a
"rmy, and fraud
"
and falsehood te
rmed military cr
aft. The habits 
of the military 
class are the a
bsence of freedo
"m, that is, disc"
"ipline, idleness"
", ignorance,
cr"
"uelty, debaucher"
"y, and drunkenne"
ss. And in spite
 of all this it 
is the highest 
"class, respected"
 by everyone. Al
"l the kings, exc"
"ept the Chinese,"
 wear military 
"uniforms, and he"
 who kills most 
people receives 
the highest rew
ards.  “They
" meet, as we sha"
ll meet tomorrow
", to murder one "
another; they ki
ll and maim ten
"s of thousands, "
and then have th
anksgiving servi
ces for having 
killed so many p
eople (they even
 exaggerate the 
"number), and the"
y announce a vi
"ctory, supposing"
 that the more p
eople they have 
killed the grea
ter their achiev
ement. How does 
God above look a
t them and hear 
 them?” exclai
med Prince Andre
"w in a shrill, p"
iercing voice. �
"��Ah, my
friend"
", it has of late"
 become hard for
 me to live. I s
ee that I have 
begun to underst
and too much. An
d it doesn’t d
o for man to tas

” he added. 
"
“However, yo"
"u’re sleepy, a"
nd it’s time f
or me to sleep. 
Go back to Gór
ki!” said Prin
ce Andrew sudden
ly.  “Oh no!
” Pierre repli
"ed, looking at P"
rince Andrew wit
"h frightened,
c"
ompassionate eye
"s.

“Go, go!"
 Before a battle
 one must have o
ne’s sleep out
",” repeated Pr"
ince Andrew.  
 He came quickly
 up to Pierre an
d embraced and k
issed him. “Go
"od-by, be
off!�"
�� he shouted. �
��Whether we mee
t again or not..
.” and turning
 away hurriedly
 he entered the 
shed.  It was 
"already dark, an"
d Pierre could n
ot make out whet
her the express
ion of Prince An
drew’s face wa
s angry or tende
r.  For some t
ime he stood in 
silence consider
ing whether he s
hould follow hi
m or go away. �
"�No, he does not"
 want it!” Pie
rre concluded. �
��And I know th
at this is our l
ast meeting!” 
He sighed deeply
 and rode back t
o Górki.  On 
re-entering the 
shed Prince Andr
ew lay down on a
" rug, but he cou"
ld not sleep. 
 He closed his 
eyes. One pictur
e succeeded anot
her in his imagi
nation. On one 
of them he dwelt
 long and joyful
ly. He vividly r
ecalled an eveni
ng in Petersbur
g. Natásha with
 animated and ex
cited face was t
elling him how 
she had gone to 
look for mushroo
ms the previous 
summer and had l
ost her way in 
the big forest. 
She incoherently
 described the d
epths of the fo
"rest, her feelin"
"gs, and a talk w"
ith a beekeeper 
"she met, and
co"
nstantly interru
pted her story t
"o say: “No, I "
can’t! I’m n
ot telling it r
"ight; no, you do"
n’t understand
",” though he e"
ncouraged her by
 saying that he
" did understand,"
 and he really h
ad understood al
l she wanted to 
 say. But Natás
ha was not satis
fied with her ow
n words: she fel
t that they did
 not convey the 
passionately poe
tic feeling she 
had experienced 
 that day and wi
shed to convey. 
“He was such a
 delightful old 
"man, and
it was"
 so dark in the 
forest... and he
 had such kind..
". No, I can’t"
"
describe it,”"
" she had said, f"
lushed and excit
ed. Prince Andre
w smiled now th
e same happy smi
le as then when 
he had looked in
to her eyes. “
I understood he
"r,” he thought"
. “I not only 
"understood her, "
but it was just 
"
that inner, spi"
"ritual force, th"
"at sincerity, th"
at frankness of 
soul—that ver
y soul of hers w
hich seemed to b
e fettered by he
r body—it was 
that soul I lov
ed in her... lov
ed so strongly a
nd happily...”
 and suddenly h
e remembered how
 his love had en
ded. “He did n
ot need anything
 of that kind. 
He neither saw n
or understood an
ything of the so
rt. He only saw 
in her a pretty
 and fresh young
" girl, with whom"
 he did not deig
n to unite his 
fate. And I?... 
and he is still 
alive and gay!�
�  Prince Andr
ew jumped up as

CHAPTER XXVI  
"On August 25, th"
e eve of the bat
tle of Borodinó
", M. de Beausset"
", prefect
of th"
e French Emperor
"’s palace, arr"
ived at Napoleon
’s quarters at
 Valúevo with 
"Colonel Fabvier,"
 the former from
 Paris and the l
atter from Madr
id.  Donning h
is court uniform
", M. de Beausset"
 ordered a box h
e had brought f
or the Emperor t
o be carried bef
ore him and ente
red the first c
ompartment of Na
"poleon’s tent,"
 where he began 
opening the box 
while conversin
g with Napoleon�
��s aides-de-cam
p who surrounded
 him.  Fabvier
", not entering t"
"he tent, remaine"
d at the entranc
e talking to som
e generals of h
is acquaintance.
  The Emperor 
Napoleon had not
 yet left his be
droom and was fi
nishing his toi
let. Slightly sn
orting and grunt
"ing, he presente"
d now his back a
nd now his plum
p hairy chest to
 the brush with 
which his valet 
was rubbing him
 down. Another v
"alet, with his f"
inger over the m
outh of a bottle
",
was sprinklin"
g Eau de Cologne
 on the Emperor�
��s pampered bod
y with an expre
ssion which seem
ed to say that h
e alone knew whe
re and how much 
Eau de Cologne 
should be sprink
led. Napoleon’
s short hair was
 wet and matted
 on the forehead
", but his face, "
though puffy and
" yellow, express"
ed physical sat
isfaction. “Go
" on, harder, go "
on!” he mutter
ed to the valet 
 who was rubbing
" him, slightly t"
witching and gru
nting. An aide-d
"e-camp,
who had"
 entered the bed
room to report t
o the Emperor th
e number of pri
soners taken in 
yesterday’s ac
"tion, was standi"
ng by the door a
fter delivering
" his message, aw"
aiting permissio
n to withdraw. N
"apoleon,
frowni"
"ng, looked at hi"
m from under his
 brows.  “No
 prisoners!” s
"aid he, repeatin"
g the aide-de-ca
mp’s words. �
�They are forci
ng us to extermi
nate them. So mu
ch the worse for
 the Russian ar
my.... Go on... 
"harder, harder!�"
"�� he muttered, "
hunching his bac
k and presentin
g his fat should
ers.  “All r
ight. Let Monsie

"d,
nodding to t"
he aide-de-camp.
"

“Yes, sire"
",” and the aid"
e-de-camp disapp
eared through th
e door of the t
ent.  Two vale
ts rapidly dress
"ed His Majesty, "
and wearing the 
blue uniform of 
 the Guards he w
ent with firm qu
ick steps to the
 reception room.
  De Beausset�
��s hands meanwh
ile were busily 
engaged arrangin
g the present h
e had brought fr
"om the Empress, "
on two chairs di
rectly in front 
of the entrance
. But Napoleon h
ad dressed and c
ome out with suc
h unexpected ra
pidity that he h
ad not time to f
inish arranging 
the surprise.  
 Napoleon notice
d at once what t
hey were about a
nd guessed that 
they were not r
eady. He did not
 wish to deprive
 them of the ple
asure of giving 
"him
a surprise,"
 so he pretended
 not to see de B
eausset and call
ed Fabvier to h
"im, listening si"
lently and with 
a stern frown to
 what Fabvier to
ld him of the h
eroism and devot
ion of his troop
s fighting at Sa
"lamanca, at
the"
 other end of Eu
"rope, with but o"
ne thought—to 
be worthy of the
ir Emperor—an
d but one fear�
�to fail to plea
se him. The resu
lt of that batt
le had been depl
orable. Napoleon
 made ironic rem
arks during Fab
vier’s account
", as if he had n"
ot expected that
 matters could g
o otherwise in 
his absence.  
“I must make u
p for that in Mo
"scow,” said Na"
poleon. “I’l
l see you later
",” he added, a"
nd summoned de B
"eausset, who by "
that time had p
repared the surp
"rise, having pla"
ced something on
 the chairs and 
covered it with
 a cloth.  De 
Beausset bowed l
"ow, with that co"
urtly French bow
 which only the 
 old retainers o
f the Bourbons k
"new how to make,"
 and approached 
"him,
presenting"
 an envelope.  
 Napoleon turned
 to him gaily an
d pulled his ear
.  “You have
 hurried here. I
 am very glad. W
"ell, what is Par"
is saying?” he
"
asked, suddenl"
y changing his f
ormer stern expr
ession for a mos
t cordial tone.
"

“Sire, all"
 Paris regrets y
"our absence,” "
replied de Beaus
set as was prop
er.  But thoug
h Napoleon knew 
that de Beausset
 had to say some
thing of this k
"ind, and though "
in his lucid mom
ents he knew it 
"was untrue, he w"
as pleased to h
ear it from him.
 Again he honore
d him by touchin
g his ear.  �
�I am very sorry
 to have made yo
"u travel so far,"
” said he.  
"“Sire, I expec"
ted nothing less
 than to find yo

"f Moscow,”
re"
plied de Beausse
t.  Napoleon s
"miled and, lifti"
ng his head abse
"nt-mindedly, gla"

ith gliding step
s and offered hi
m a gold snuffb
"ox, which he too"

“Yes, it"
 has happened lu
"ckily for you,�"
"� he said, raisi"
ng the open snu

d in three days 
you will see Mo
scow. You surely
 did not expect 
to see that Asia
tic capital. Yo
u will have a pl
easant journey.�
��  De Beausse
t bowed grateful
ly at this regar
d for his taste 
for travel (of 
which he had not
 till then been 
aware).  “Ha
", what’s this?"
” asked Napole
"on, noticing tha"
t all the courti
ers were lookin
g at something c
oncealed under a
 cloth.  With 
courtly adroitne
ss de Beausset h
alf turned and w
ithout turning h
is back to the 
Emperor retired 
"two steps, twitc"
hing off the clo
th at the same 
"time, and said:"
  “A present 
to Your Majesty 
from the Empress
.”  It was a
" portrait, paint"
ed in bright col
"ors by Gérard, "
of the son borne
 to Napoleon by
 the daughter of
 the Emperor of 
"Austria, the boy"
 whom for some 
reason everyone 
called “The Ki
ng of Rome.” 
 A very pretty 
curly-headed boy
 with a look of 
the Christ in th
e Sistine Madon
na was depicted 
playing at stick
 and ball. The b
all represented 
the terrestrial
 globe and the s
tick in his othe
r hand a scepter
.  Though it w
as not clear wha
t the artist mea
nt to express by
 depicting the 
so-called King o
f Rome spiking t
he earth with a 
"stick, the alleg"
ory apparently 
seemed to Napole
"on, as it had do"
ne to all who ha
d seen it in Pa
"ris, quite clear"
 and very pleasi
ng.  “The Ki
ng of Rome!” h
"e said, pointing"
 to the portrait
 with a graceful
 gesture. “Ad
mirable!”  W
ith the natural 
capacity of an I
talian for chang
ing the expressi
on of his face 
"at will, he drew"
 nearer to the p
ortrait and assu
med a look of p
ensive tendernes
s. He felt that 
what he now said
 and did would b
"e
historical, a"
nd it seemed to 
him that it woul
d now be best fo
r him—whose g
randeur enabled 
his son to play 
stick and ball w
ith the terrestr
ial globe—to 
"show, in contras"
t to that grande
"ur, the simplest"
 paternal tende
rness. His eyes 
"grew dim, he mov"
"ed forward, glan"
ced round at a 
chair (which see
med to place its
"elf under him), "
and sat down on 
it before the p
ortrait. At a si
ngle gesture fro
m him everyone w
ent out on tipt
"oe, leaving the "
great man to him
self and his emo
tion.  Having 
sat still for a 
while he touched
—himself not k
nowing why—the
 thick spot of 
paint representi
ng the highest l
ight in the port
"rait,
rose, and"
 recalled de Bea
usset and the of
ficer on duty. H
e ordered the p
ortrait to be ca
rried outside hi
"s tent, that the"
" Old Guard, stat"
"ioned
round it,"
 might not be de
prived of the pl
easure of seeing
 the King of Ro
"me, the son and "
heir of their ad
ored monarch.  
 And while he wa
s doing M. de Be
ausset the honor
 of breakfasting
" with
him, they"
" heard, as Napol"
eon had anticipa
"ted, the rapturo"
us cries of the 
 officers and me
n of the Old Gua
rd who had run u
p to see the por
trait.  “Viv
e l’Empereur! 
Vive le roi de R
ome! Vive l’Em
pereur!” came 
those ecstatic 
cries.  After 
breakfast Napole
on in de Beausse
t’s presence d
ictated his orde
r of the day to
 the army.  �
�Short and energ
etic!” he rema
rked when he had
 read over the 
proclamation whi
ch he had dictat
ed straight off 
without correcti
ons. It ran:  
 Soldiers! This 
is the battle yo
u have so longed
 for. Victory de
pends on you. I
t is essential f
or us; it will g
ive us all we ne
ed: comfortable 
 quarters and a 
speedy return to
 our country. Be
have as you did 
"at
Austerlitz, "
"Friedland, Víte"
"bsk, and Smolén"
sk. Let our remo
test posterity 
recall your achi
evements this da
y with pride. Le
t it be said of 
each of you: �
�He was in the g
reat battle befo
re Moscow!”  
 “Before Mosco
w!” repeated N
"apoleon, and inv"
iting M. de Beau
"sset, who was
s"
o fond of travel
", to accompany h"
"im on his ride, "
he went out of t
he tent to wher
e the horses sto
od saddled.  �
��Your Majesty i
s too kind!” r
eplied de Beauss
et to the invita
tion to accompa
ny the Emperor; 
he wanted to sle
"ep, did not know"
 how to ride and
 was afraid of 
doing so.  But
 Napoleon nodded
 to the traveler
", and de Beausse"
t had to mount. 
When Napoleon c
ame out of the t
ent the shouting
 of the Guards b
efore his son�
�s portrait grew
 still louder. N
apoleon frowned.
  “Take him 
away!” he said
", pointing with "
a gracefully maj
estic gesture to
 the portrait. 
“It is too soo
n for him to see
 a field of batt
le.”  De Bea
usset closed his
" eyes, bowed his"
" head, and sighe"
"d deeply, to
in"
dicate how profo
undly he valued 
and comprehended
 the Emperor’s
 words.     
  CHAPTER XXVII
  On the twent
y-fifth of Augus
"t, so his histor"
"ians tell us, Na"
poleon spent th
e whole day on h
orseback inspect
ing the locality
", considering pl"
ans submitted t
o him by his mar
"shals, and perso"
nally giving com
mands to his ge
nerals.  The o
riginal line of 
the Russian forc
es along the riv
er Kolochá had 
 been dislocated
 by the capture 
of the Shevárdi
no Redoubt on th
e twenty-fourth
", and part of th"
e line—the lef
t flank—had be
en drawn back. 
That part of the
 line was not en
trenched and in 
front of it the 
ground was more
 open and level 
than elsewhere. 
It was evident t
"o anyone,
milit"
"ary or not, that"
 it was here the
 French should a
ttack. It would 
 seem that not m
uch consideratio
n was needed to 
reach this concl
"usion,
nor any "
particular care 
or trouble on th
e part of the Em
peror and his m
"arshals, nor was"
 there any need 
of that special 
and supreme qual
ity called geni
us that people a
re so apt to asc
ribe to Napoleon
; yet the histo
rians who descri
bed the event la
ter and the men 
who then surroun
"ded
Napoleon, a"
"nd he himself, t"
hought otherwise
.  Napoleon ro
de over the plai
n and surveyed t
he locality with
 a profound air
" and in silence,"
 nodded with app
roval or shook h
is head dubiousl
"y,
and without "
communicating to
 the generals ar
ound him the pro
found course of
 ideas which gui
ded his decision
s merely gave th
em his final co
nclusions in the
 form of command
s. Having listen
ed to a suggesti
"on
from Davout,"
 who was now cal
led Prince d’E
"ckmühl, to turn"
 the Russian le
"ft wing, Napoleo"
n said it should
" not be done, wi"
thout explaining
 why not. To a 
proposal made by
 General Campan 
(who was to atta
ck the flèches
) to lead his di
vision through t
"he woods, Napole"
"on agreed, thoug"
h the so-called
 Duke of Elching
en (Ney) venture
d to remark that
 a movement thr
ough the woods w
as dangerous and
 might disorder 
the division.  
 Having inspecte
d the country op
posite the Shev�
"�rdino Redoubt, "
Napoleon ponder
ed a little in s
ilence and then 
indicated the sp
ots where two b
atteries should 
be set up by the
 morrow to act a
gainst the Russi
an entrenchment
"s, and the place"
"s where, in line"
" with them, the "
field artillery
 should be place
d.  After givi
ng these and oth
er commands he r
eturned to his t
"ent, and the
di"
spositions for t
he battle were w
ritten down from
 his dictation. 
  These disposi
"tions, of which "
the French histo
rians write with
 enthusiasm and
 other historian
s with profound 
"respect, were as"
 follows:  At 
dawn the two new
 batteries estab
lished during th
e night on the 
plain occupied b
y the Prince d�
�Eckmühl will o
pen fire on the 
opposing batter
ies of the enemy
.  At the same
 time the comman
der of the artil
lery of the 1st 
"Corps,
General "
"Pernetti, with t"
hirty cannon of 
Campan’s divis
ion and all the 
 howitzers of De
ssaix’s and Fr
iant’s divisio
"ns, will move fo"
"rward, open
fir"
"e, and overwhelm"
 with shellfire 
the enemy’s ba
"ttery, against w"
hich will opera
te:          2
4 guns of the ar
tillery of the G
uards         3
0 guns of Campan
’s division  
  and     8 guns
 of Friant’s a
nd Dessaix’s d
ivisions       
  —   in all
 62 guns.  The
 commander of th
e artillery of t
"he 3rd Corps, Ge"
"neral Fouché, w"
ill place the h
owitzers of the 
3rd and 8th Corp
"s, sixteen in al"
"l, on the
flank"
s of the battery
 that is to bomb
ard the entrench
ment on the left
",
which will ha"
ve forty guns in
 all directed ag
ainst it.  Gen
eral Sorbier mus
t be ready at th
e first order to
 advance with al
l the howitzers
 of the Guard’
s artillery agai
nst either one o
r other of the 
entrenchments. 
 During the can
nonade Prince Po
niatowski is to 
advance through 
the wood on the
 village and tur
n the enemy’s 
position.  Gen
eral Campan will
 move through th
e wood to seize 
the first forti
fication.  Aft
er the advance h
as begun in this
" manner, orders "
will be given in
 accordance wit
h the enemy’s 
movements.  Th
e cannonade on t
he left flank wi
ll begin as soon
 as the guns of 
the right wing 
are heard. The s
harpshooters of 
Morand’s divis
ion and of the 
vice-King’s di
vision will open
 a heavy fire on
 seeing the atta
ck commence on 
the right wing. 
  The vice-King
 will occupy the
 village and cro
ss by its three 
"bridges,
advanc"
ing to the same 
heights as Moran
d’s and Gibrar
"d’s divisions,"
 which under hi
s leadership wil
l be directed ag
ainst the redoub
t and come into 
 line with the r
est of the force
s.  All this m
ust be done in g
ood order (le to
ut se fera avec 
ordre et métho
de) as far as po
ssible retaining
 troops in reser
ve.  The Imper
ial Camp near Mo
"zháysk,

Sept"
"ember, 6, 1812."
   These dispo
"sitions, which a"
re very obscure 
and confused if 
one allows ones
elf to regard th
e arrangements w
ithout religious
 awe of his geni
"us,
related to "
Napoleon’s ord
ers to deal with
 four points—f
our different o
rders. Not one o
"f these was, or "
"could be, carrie"
d out.  In the
 disposition it 
is said first th
at the batteries
 placed on the 
spot chosen by N
"apoleon, with th"
e guns of Pernet
ti and Fouché; 
which were to c
ome in line with
" them, 102 guns "
"in all, were to "
open fire and s
hower shells on 
the Russian flè
ches and redoubt
s. This could no
"t be
done, as f"
rom the spots se
lected by Napole
on the projectil
es did not carr
y to the Russian
" works, and thos"
e 102 guns shot 
into the air unt
il the nearest 
"commander, contr"
ary to Napoleon�
��s instructions
", moved them
fo"
rward.  The se
cond order was t
"hat Poniatowski,"
 moving to the v
illage through t
"he
wood, should"
 turn the Russia
n left flank. Th
is could not be 
done and was no
"t done, because "
"Poniatowski, adv"
ancing on the vi
llage through th
"e
wood, met Tú"
chkov there barr
"ing his way, and"
 could not and d
id not turn the
 Russian positio
n.  The third 
order was: Gener
al Campan will m
ove through the 
wood to seize t
he first fortifi
cation. General 
Campan’s divis
ion did not seiz
e the first for
tification but w
"as driven back, "
for on emerging 
from the wood i
t had to reform 
"under grapeshot,"
 of which Napole
on was unaware. 
  The fourth or
der was: The vic
e-King will occu
py the village (
Borodinó) and 
cross by its thr
"ee bridges, adva"
ncing to the sam
e heights as Mo
rand’s and Gé
rard’s divisio
ns (for whose mo
vements no direc
tions are given
"), which under h"
is leadership wi
ll be directed a
gainst the redou
bt and come int
o line with the 
rest of the forc
es.  As far as
 one can make ou
"t, not so much f"
rom this unintel
ligible sentenc
e as from the at
tempts the vice-
King made to exe
cute the orders 
"
given him, he w"
as to advance fr
om the left thro
ugh Borodinó to
 the redoubt wh
ile the division
s of Morand and 
Gérard were to 
advance simulta
neously from the
 front.  All t
"his, like the ot"
her parts of the
" disposition, wa"
s not and could 
 not be executed
. After passing 
through Borodin�
� the vice-King 
was driven back
 to the Kolochá
 and could get n
o farther; while
 the divisions o
f Morand and G�
�rard did not ta
ke the redoubt b
ut were driven b
"ack, and the
re"
doubt was only t
aken at the end 
of the battle by
 the cavalry (a 
thing probably 
unforeseen and n
ot heard of by N
apoleon). So not
 one of the ord
ers in the dispo
"sition was, or c"
"ould be, execute"
d. But in the d
isposition it is
" said that, afte"
r the fight has 
commenced in thi
"s
manner, order"
s will be given 
in accordance wi
th the enemy’s
" movements,
and"
 so it might be 
supposed that al
l necessary arra
ngements would b
e made by Napol
eon during the b
attle. But this 
was not and coul
"d not be
done, "
for during the w
hole battle Napo
leon was so far 
"away that, as
a"
"ppeared later, h"
e could not know
 the course of t
he battle and no
t one of his or
ders during the 
fight could be e
xecuted.    
  CHAPTER XXVI
II  Many histo
rians say that t
he French did no
t win the battle
 of Borodinó b
ecause Napoleon 
"had a cold, and "
that if he had n
ot had a cold th
e orders he gav
e before and dur
ing the battle w
ould have been s
till more full 
of genius and Ru
ssia would have 
been lost and th
e face of the wo
rld have been c
hanged. To histo
rians who believ
e that Russia wa
s shaped by the
 will of one man
—Peter the Gre
at—and that Fr
ance from a repu
blic became an 
empire and Frenc
h armies went to
 Russia at the w
ill of one man�
��Napoleon—to 
say that Russia 
remained a power
 because Napoleo
n had a bad col
d on the twenty-
fourth of August
 may seem logica
l and convincing
.  If it had d
epended on Napol
eon’s will to 
fight or not to 
fight the battl
"e of Borodinó, "
and if this or t
hat other arrang
ement depended o
"n
his will, the"
n evidently a co
ld affecting the
 manifestation o
f his will migh
t have saved Rus
"sia, and consequ"
ently the valet 
who omitted to b
ring Napoleon h
is waterproof bo
ots on the twent
y-fourth would h
ave been the sa
vior of Russia. 
Along that line 
of thought such 
a deduction is 
"indubitable, as "
indubitable as t
he deduction Vol
taire made in je
st (without kno
wing what he was
 jesting at) whe
n he saw that th
e Massacre of S
t. Bartholomew w
as due to Charle
s IX’s stomach
 being deranged.
 But to men who
 do not admit th
at Russia was fo
rmed by the will
" of one man,
Pe"
"ter I, or that t"
he French Empire
 was formed and 
the war with Rus
sia begun by th
e will of one ma
"n, Napoleon, tha"
t argument seems
 not merely unt
rue and irration
"al, but contrary"
 to all human re
ality. To the q
uestion of what 
causes historic 
events another a
nswer presents i
"tself,
namely, "
that the course 
of human events 
is predetermined
 from on high�
�depends on the 
coincidence of t
he wills of all 
who take part in
" the
events, an"
d that a Napoleo
n’s influence 
on the course of
 these events is
 purely externa
l and fictitious
.  Strange as 
at first glance 
it may seem to s
uppose that the 
Massacre of St.
 Bartholomew was
 not due to Char
"les IX’s will,"
 though he gave 
the order for i
t and thought it
 was done as a r
esult of that or
der; and strang
e as it may seem
 to suppose that
 the slaughter o
f eighty thousan
d men at Borodi
nó was not due 
to Napoleon’s 
"will, though he "
ordered the com
mencement and co
nduct of the bat
tle and thought 
it was done bec
ause he ordered 
it; strange as t
hese supposition
"s appear, yet hu"
man dignity—w
hich tells me th
at each of us is
", if not more at"
 least not less 
 a man than the 
great Napoleon�
�demands the acc
eptance of that 
solution of the
" question, and h"
istoric investig
ation abundantly
 confirms it.  
 At the battle o
f Borodinó Napo
leon shot at no 
one and killed n
o one. That was
 all done by the
 soldiers. There
fore it was not 
he who killed p
eople.  The Fr
ench soldiers we
nt to kill and b
e killed at the 
battle of Borodi
nó not because
 of Napoleon’s
 orders but by t
heir own volitio
n. The whole ar
"my—French, Ita"
"lian, German, Po"
"lish, and Dutch�"
"��hungry, ragged"
", and
weary of "
"the campaign, fe"
lt at the sight 
of an army block
ing their road 
to Moscow that t
he wine was draw
n and must be dr
unk. Had Napoleo
n then forbidde
n them to fight 
"the Russians, th"
ey would have ki
lled him and ha
ve proceeded to 
fight the Russia
ns because it wa
s inevitable.  
 When they heard
 Napoleon’s pr
oclamation offer
"ing them, as com"
pensation for m
utilation and de
"ath, the words o"
f posterity abou
t their having b
een in the batt
le before Moscow
", they cried “"
Vive l’Empereu
r!” just as th
ey had cried �
�Vive l’Empere
ur!” at the si
ght of the portr
ait of the boy 
piercing the ter
restrial globe w
"ith a toy stick,"
 and just as the
y would have cr
ied “Vive l’
Empereur!” at 
any nonsense tha
t might be told 
them. There was
 nothing left fo
r them to do but
 cry “Vive l�
�Empereur!” an
"d go
to fight, "
in order to get 
food and rest as
 conquerors in M
oscow. So it wa
s not because of
 Napoleon’s co
mmands that they
 killed their fe
llow men.  An
d it was not Nap
oleon who direct
ed the course of
" the battle, for"
 none of his or
ders were execut
ed and during th
e battle he did 
not know what w
as going on befo
re him. So the w
ay in which thes
e people killed 
one another was
 not decided by 
Napoleon’s wil
l but occurred i
ndependently of 
"
him, in accord "
with the will of
 hundreds of tho
usands of people
 who took part 
in the common ac
tion. It only se
emed to Napoleon
 that it all too
k place by his 
will. And so the
 question whethe
r he had or had 
not a cold has 
no more historic
 interest than t
he cold of the l
east of the tra
nsport soldiers.
"

Moreover, th"
e assertion made
 by various writ
ers that his col
d was the cause
 of his disposit
ions not being a
s well-planned a
s on former occ
"asions, and of h"
is orders during
 the battle not 
being as good as
"
previously, is"
" quite baseless,"
 which again sho
ws that Napoleon
’s cold on th
e twenty-sixth o
f August was uni
mportant.  The
 dispositions ci
ted above are no
"t at all worse, "
but are even be
"tter, than previ"
ous dispositions
 by which he had
 won victories. 
His pseudo-orde
rs during the ba
ttle were also n
o worse than for
"merly, but
much"
 the same as usu
al. These dispos
itions and order
s only seem wors
e than previous
 ones because th
e battle of Boro
dinó was the fi
rst Napoleon di
d not win. The p
rofoundest and m
ost excellent di
spositions and o
rders seem very
" bad, and every "
learned militari
st criticizes th
em with looks o
"f importance, wh"
en they relate t
o a battle that 
"has been lost, a"
nd the very wor
st dispositions 
and orders seem 
"very good, and s"
erious people f
ill whole volume
s to demonstrate
" their merits, w"
hen they relate 
to a battle tha
t has been won. 
  The dispositi
ons drawn up by 
Weyrother for th
e battle of Aust
erlitz were a m
odel of perfecti
on for that kind
" of composition,"
 but still they 
were criticized
—criticized fo
r their very per
"fection, for the"
ir excessive mi
nuteness.  Nap
oleon at the bat
tle of Borodinó
 fulfilled his o
ffice as repres
entative of auth
ority as well as
", and even bette"
"r than, at other"
 battles. He di
d nothing harmfu
l to the progres
s of the battle;
 he inclined to
 the most reason
"able opinions, h"
e made no confus
"ion, did not
co"
ntradict himself
", did not get fr"
ightened or run 
away from the fi
"eld of
battle, "
but with his gre
at tact and mili
tary experience 
carried out his 
 role of appeari
"ng to command, c"
almly and with d
ignity.     
  CHAPTER XXIX 
  On returning 
from a second in
spection of the 
"lines, Napoleon "
remarked:  “
The chessmen are
" set up, the gam"
e will begin tom
orrow!”  Hav
ing ordered punc
h and summoned d
"e Beausset, he b"
egan to talk to 
him about Paris
 and about some 
changes he meant
 to make in the 
Empress’ hous
"ehold, surprisin"
g the prefect by
 his memory of m
inute details r
elating to the c
ourt.  He show
ed an interest i
"n trifles, joked"
 about de Beauss
et’s love of 
"travel, and chat"
"ted carelessly, "
"as a famous, sel"
f-confident surg
eon who knows h
is job does when
 turning up his 
sleeves and putt
ing on his apron
 while a patien
t is being strap
ped to the opera
ting table. “T
he matter is in
 my hands and is
 clear and defin
ite in my head. 
When the time co
mes to set to w
ork I shall do i
t as no one else
" could, but now "
"I can jest, and"
 the more I jest
 and the calmer 
I am the more tr
anquil and confi
dent you ought 
"to be, and the m"
ore amazed at my
 genius.”  H
aving finished h
is second glass 
"of punch, Napole"
on went to rest 
before the seri
ous business whi
"ch, he considere"
"d, awaited him n"
ext day. He was
 so much interes
ted in that task
 that he was una
"ble to sleep, an"
d in spite of h
is cold which ha
d grown worse fr
om the dampness 
"of the
evening,"
 he went into th
e large division
 of the tent at 
three o’clock 
"in
the morning,"
 loudly blowing 
his nose. He ask
ed whether the R
ussians had not
" withdrawn, and "
was told that th
e enemy’s fire
s were still in 
the same places
. He nodded appr
oval.  The adj
utant in attenda
nce came into th
e tent.  “We
"ll, Rapp, do you"
 think we shall 
do good business
 today?” Napol
eon asked him. 
  “Without do
"ubt, sire,” re"
plied Rapp.  N
apoleon looked a
t him.  “Do 
"you remember, si"
"re, what you did"
 me the honor to
 say at Smoléns
k?” continued
 Rapp. “The wi
ne is drawn and 
must be drunk.�
�  Napoleon fr
owned and sat si
lent for a long 
time leaning his
 head on his ha
nd.  “This p
oor army!” he 
suddenly remarke
d. “It has dim
inished greatly 
since Smolénsk
. Fortune is fra
nkly a courtesan
", Rapp. I have a"
lways said so a
nd I am beginnin
g to experience 
it. But the Guar
"ds, Rapp, the Gu"
ards are intact
?” he remarked
 interrogatively
".

“Yes, sir"
"e,” replied Ra"
pp.  Napoleon 
"took a lozenge, "
put it in his mo
"uth, and glanced"
 at his watch. 
He was not sleep
y and it was sti
ll not nearly mo
rning. It was im
possible to giv
e further orders
 for the sake of
" killing time, f"
or the orders ha
d all been give
n and were now b
eing executed. 
 “Have the bi
scuits and rice 
been served out 
to the regiments
 of the Guards?
” asked Napole
on sternly.  �
"��Yes, sire.”"
  “The rice t
oo?”  Rapp r
eplied that he h
ad given the Emp
eror’s order a
"bout the rice, b"
ut Napoleon sho
ok his head in d
issatisfaction a
s if not believi
ng that his ord
er had been exec
uted. An attenda
nt came in with 
punch. Napoleon 
 ordered another
 glass to be bro
"ught for Rapp, a"
nd silently sipp
ed his own.  
“I have neithe
r taste nor smel
"l,” he remarke"
"d, sniffing at h"
is glass. “Th
is cold is tires
ome. They talk a
bout medicine—
what is the good
 of medicine wh
en it can’t cu
re a cold! Corvi
sart gave me the
se lozenges but 
 they don’t he
lp at all. What 
can doctors cure
? One can’t cu
re anything. Ou
r body is a mach
ine for living. 
It is organized 
"for that, it is "
its nature. Let
 life go on in i
t unhindered and
 let it defend i
"tself, it
will "
do more than if 
you paralyze it 
by encumbering i
t with remedies.
 Our body is li
ke a perfect wat
ch that should g
o for a certain 
time; the watch
maker cannot ope
"n it, he can onl"
y adjust it by f
"umbling, and tha"
t blindfold....
" Yes, our body i"
s just a machine
" for living, tha"
t is all.”  
And having enter
ed on the path o
"f definition, of"
 which he was fo
"nd,
Napoleon su"
ddenly and unexp
ectedly gave a n
ew one.  “Do
" you know, Rapp,"
 what military a
rt is?” asked 
he. “It is the
 art of being s
tronger than the
 enemy at a give
n moment. That�
�s all.”  Ra
pp made no reply
.  “Tomorrow
 we shall have t
o deal with Kut�
�zov!” said Na
poleon. “We sh
all see! Do you
 remember at Bra
unau he commande
d an army for th
ree weeks and d
id not once moun
t a horse to ins
pect his entrenc
hments.... We sh
all see!”  
He looked at his
 watch. It was s
till only four o
’clock. He did
 not feel sleep
y. The punch was
 finished and th
ere was still no
thing to do. He 
"
rose, walked to"
" and fro, put on"
 a warm overcoat
" and a hat, and "
went out of the
 tent. The night
 was dark and da
"mp, a scarcely p"
erceptible mois
ture was descend
ing from above. 
"Near by, the cam"
pfires were diml
y burning among
 the French Guar
"ds, and in the d"
istance those of
 the Russian li
ne shone through
 the smoke. The 
weather was calm
", and the
rustl"
e and tramp of t
he French troops
 already beginni
ng to move to ta
ke up their pos
itions were clea
rly audible.  
Napoleon walked 
about in front o
"f his tent, look"
ed at the fires 
and listened to
" these sounds, a"
nd as he was pas
sing a tall guar
dsman in a shag
"gy cap, who was "
standing sentine
l before his ten
t and had drawn 
 himself up like
 a black pillar 
at sight of the 
"Emperor, Napoleo"
n stopped in fr
ont of him.  �
��What year did 
you enter the se
rvice?” he ask
ed with that aff
ectation of mil
itary bluntness 
and geniality wi
th which he alwa
ys addressed the
 soldiers.  T
he man answered 
the question.  
 “Ah! One of t
he old ones! Has
 your regiment h
ad its rice?” 
"

“It has, Yo"
ur Majesty.” 
 Napoleon nodde
d and walked awa
y.   At half-
past five Napole
on rode to the v
illage of Shevá
rdino.  It was
" growing light, "
the sky was clea
"ring, only a sin"
gle cloud lay in
 the east. The 
abandoned campfi
res were burning
 themselves out 
in the faint mo
rning light.  
On the right a s
ingle deep repor
t of a cannon re
sounded and died
 away in the pr
evailing silence
. Some minutes p
assed. A second 
and a third repo
rt shook the ai
"r, then a fourth"
 and a fifth boo
med solemnly nea
r by on the rig
ht.  The first
 shots had not y
et ceased to rev
erberate before 
others rang out 
 and yet more we
re heard minglin
g with and overt
aking one anothe
r.  Napoleon w
ith his suite ro
de up to the She
várdino Redoubt
 where he dismo
unted. The game 
had begun.   
   CHAPTER XX
X  On returnin
g to Górki afte
r having seen Pr
"ince Andrew, Pie"
rre ordered his
 groom to get th
e horses ready a
nd to call him e
arly in the morn
"ing,
and then i"
mmediately fell 
asleep behind a 
partition in a c
orner Borís ha
d given up to hi
m.  Before he 
was thoroughly a
wake next mornin
g everybody had 
already left th
e hut. The panes
 were rattling i
n the little win
dows and his gro
om was shaking 
him.  “Your 
excellency! Your
 excellency! You
r excellency!”
 he kept repeati
ng pertinacious
ly while he shoo
k Pierre by the 
shoulder without
 looking at him
", having apparen"
tly lost hope of
 getting him to 
wake up.  “W
hat? Has it begu
n? Is it time?�
"� Pierre asked, "
waking up.  �
�Hear the firing
",” said the gr"
"oom, a discharge"
d soldier. “Al
l the gentlemen
" have gone out, "
and his Serene H
ighness himself 
rode past long 
ago.”  Pierr
e dressed hastil
y and ran out to
 the porch. Outs
ide all was brig
"ht,
fresh, dewy"
", and cheerful. "
"The sun, just bu"
rsting forth fro
m behind a clou
d that had conce
"aled it, was shi"
"ning, with rays "
still half broke
n by the clouds
", over the roofs"
 of the street o
"pposite, on the"
 dew-besprinkled
 dust of the roa
"d, on the walls "
"of the houses, o"
"n the
windows, "
"the fence, and o"
n Pierre’s hor
ses standing bef
ore the hut. The
 roar of guns s
ounded more dist
inct outside. An
 adjutant accomp
anied by a Coss
ack passed by at
 a sharp trot. 
 “It’s time
", Count; it’s "
time!” cried t
he adjutant.  
Telling the groo
m to follow him 
"with the horses,"
 Pierre went dow
n the street to
 the knoll from 
which he had loo
ked at the field
 of battle the 
day before. A cr
owd of military 
men was assemble
"d there, members"
 of the staff c
ould be heard co
nversing in Fren
"ch, and Kutúzov"
’s gray head i
n a white cap w
ith a red band w
"as visible, his "
gray nape sunk b
etween his shou
lders. He was lo
oking through a 
field glass down
 the highroad be
fore him.  Mo
unting the steps
 to the knoll Pi
erre looked at t
he scene before 
"him,
spellbound"
 by beauty. It w
as the same pano
rama he had admi
red from that s
pot the day befo
"re, but now the "
whole place was 
full of troops a
nd covered by s
moke clouds from
" the guns, and t"
he slanting rays
 of the bright 
"sun, rising slig"
htly to the left
" behind Pierre, "
cast upon it th
rough the clear 
morning air pene
trating streaks 
"of rosy, golden-"
tinted light an
d long dark shad
ows. The forest 
at the farthest 
extremity of th
e panorama seeme
d carved in some
 precious stone 
of a yellowish-g
reen color; its
 undulating outl
ine was silhouet
ted against the 
horizon and was
 pierced beyond 
Valúevo by the 
Smolénsk highro
ad crowded with 
troops. Nearer 
at hand glittere
d golden cornfie
lds interspersed
 with copses. T
here were troops
 to be seen ever
"ywhere, in front"
 and to the righ
t and left. All
" this was vivid,"
" majestic, and u"
nexpected; but w
hat impressed P
ierre most of al
l was the view o
f the battlefiel
"d itself, of Bor"
odinó and the 
hollows on both 
sides of the Kol
ochá.  Above 
"the Kolochá, in"
 Borodinó and o
n both sides of 
"it, especially t"
o the left wher
e the Vóyna flo
wing between its
 marshy banks fa
lls into the Ko
"lochá, a mist h"
ad spread which 
"seemed to melt, "
"to dissolve, and"
 to become tran
slucent when the
 brilliant sun a
ppeared and magi
cally colored a
nd outlined ever
ything. The smok
e of the guns mi
ngled with this 
"mist,
and over "
the whole expans
e and through th
at mist the rays
 of the morning 
 sun were reflec
"ted, flashing ba"
ck like lightnin
g from the water
", from
the dew,"
 and from the ba
yonets of the tr
oops crowded tog
ether by the ri
verbanks and in 
Borodinó. A whi
te church could 
be seen through 
"the
mist, and h"
ere and there th
e roofs of huts 
in Borodinó as 
well as dense m
asses of soldier
"s, or green ammu"
nition chests an
d ordnance. And 
"all
this moved,"
 or seemed to mo
"ve, as the smoke"
 and mist spread
 out over the w
hole space. Just
 as in the mist-
enveloped hollow
" near Borodinó,"
 so along the e
ntire line outsi
de and above it 
and especially i
n the woods and
 fields to the l
"eft, in the vall"
eys and on the s
ummits of the hi
"gh
ground, clou"
ds of powder smo
ke seemed contin
ually to spring 
up out of nothi
"ng, now singly, "
now several at a
" time, some tran"
"slucent, others"
"
dense, which, s"
"welling, growing"
", rolling, and b"
"lending, extende"
d over the whol
e expanse.  Th
ese puffs of smo
ke and (strange 
to say) the soun
d of the firing 
 produced the ch
ief beauty of th
e spectacle.  
“Puff!”—su
ddenly a round c
ompact cloud of 
smoke was seen m
erging from vio
let into gray an
"d milky white, a"
nd “boom!” c
ame the report a
 second later. 
  “Puff! puff
!”—and two c
louds arose push
ing one another 
and blending to
gether; and “b
"oom, boom!” ca"
me the sounds co
nfirming what th
e eye had seen.
  Pierre glanc
ed round at the 
"first cloud, whi"
ch he had seen a
s a round compa
"ct ball, and in "
its place alread
y were balloons 
of smoke floatin
"g
to one side, "
and—“puff”
 (with a pause)�
"��“puff, puff!"
” three and th
en four more ap
peared and then 
"from each, with "
the same interva
l—“boom—bo
"om,
boom!” ca"
"me the fine, fir"
"m, precise sound"
s in reply. It s
eemed as if tho
se smoke clouds 
sometimes ran an
d sometimes stoo
d still while wo
"ods,
fields, an"
d glittering bay
onets ran past t
hem. From the le
"ft, over
fields"
" and bushes, tho"
se large balls o
f smoke were con
tinually appeari
ng followed by 
their solemn rep
"orts, while near"
"er still, in the"
 hollows and wo
"ods, there burst"
 from the musket
s small cloudlet
s that had no ti
me to become ba
"lls, but had the"
ir little echoes
 in just the sam
e way. “Trakh
-ta-ta-takh!” 
came the frequen
t crackle of mus
"ketry, but it wa"
s irregular and
 feeble in compa
rison with the r
eports of the ca
nnon.  Pierre 
wished to be the
re with that smo
"ke, those shinin"
"g bayonets, that"
"
movement, and "
those sounds. He
 turned to look 
at Kutúzov and 
"his suite,
to c"
ompare his impre
ssions with thos
e of others. The
y were all looki
ng at the field
 of battle as he
" was, and, as it"
" seemed to him, "
with the same f
eelings. All the
ir faces were no
w shining with t
hat latent warmt
h of feeling Pi
erre had noticed
 the day before 
and had fully un
derstood after 
his talk with Pr
ince Andrew.  
"“Go, my dear f"
"ellow, go... and"
 Christ be with 
you!” Kutúzov
 was saying to 
a general who st
"ood beside him, "
not taking his e
ye from the bat
tlefield.  Hav
ing received thi
s order the gene
ral passed by Pi
erre on his way 
down the knoll.
  “To the cr
ossing!” said 
the general cold
ly and sternly i
n reply to one 
of the staff who
 asked where he 
was going.  �
�I’ll go there
" too, I too!” "
"thought Pierre, "
and followed the
 general.  The
 general mounted
 a horse a Cossa
ck had brought h
im. Pierre went 
to his groom wh
o was holding hi
"s horses and, as"
king which was t
"he quietest,
cl"
"ambered onto it,"
 seized it by th
"e mane, and turn"
ing out his toes
 pressed his he
els against its 
"sides and, feeli"
ng that his spec
tacles were sli
pping off but un
able to let go o
f the mane and r
"eins, he
gallop"
ed after the gen
"eral, causing th"
e staff officers
 to smile as the
y watched him f
rom the knoll. 
     CHAPTE
R XXXI  Having
 descended the h
ill the general 
after whom Pierr
e was galloping 
 turned sharply 
"to the left, and"
" Pierre, losing "
"sight of him, ga"
lloped in among
 some ranks of i
nfantry marching
 ahead of him. H
e tried to pass 
 either in front
 of them or to t
he right or left
", but there were"
 soldiers every
"where, all with "
the same preoccu
pied expression 
and busy with s
ome unseen but e
vidently importa
nt task. They al
l gazed with the
 same dissatisf
ied and inquirin
g expression at 
this stout man i
"n a white hat,
"
who for some unk
nown reason thre
atened to trampl
e them under his
 horse’s hoof
s.  “Why rid
e into the middl
e of the battali
on?” one of th
em shouted at hi
m.  Another pr
odded his horse 
with the butt en
"d of a musket, a"
"nd Pierre,
bend"
ing over his sad
dlebow and hardl
y able to contro
l his shying hor
"se,
galloped ah"
ead of the soldi
ers where there 
was a free space
.  There was a
 bridge ahead of
" him, where othe"
r soldiers stood
 firing. Pierre
 rode up to them
. Without being 
aware of it he h
ad come to the 
bridge across th
e Kolochá betwe
en Górki and Bo
"rodinó, which t"
he French (havi
ng occupied Boro
dinó) were atta
cking in the fir
st phase of the 
 battle. Pierre 
saw that there w
as a bridge in f
ront of him and 
that soldiers w
ere doing someth
ing on both side
s of it and in t
"he meadow,
amon"
g the rows of ne
w-mown hay which
 he had taken no
 notice of amid 
the smoke of th
e campfires the 
day before; but 
despite the ince
ssant firing go
ing on there he 
had no idea that
 this was the fi
eld of battle. H
e did not notic
e the sound of t
he bullets whist
ling from every 
"side, or the
pr"
ojectiles that f
"lew over him, di"
d not see the en
emy on the other
 side of the ri
"ver, and for a l"
ong time did not
 notice the kill
"ed and wounded,"
 though many fel
l near him. He l
ooked about him 
with a smile whi
ch did not leav
e his face.  �
��Why’s that f
ellow in front o
f the line?” s
houted somebody 
at him again.  
 “To the left!
... Keep to the 
right!” the me
n shouted to him
.  Pierre went
" to the right, a"
nd unexpectedly 
encountered one 
of Raévski’s 
 adjutants whom 
he knew. The adj
utant looked ang
"rily at him, evi"
dently also int
ending to shout 
"at him, but on r"
ecognizing him h
e nodded.  “
How have you got
 here?” he sai
"d, and galloped "
"on.

Pierre, f"
eeling out of pl
"ace there, havin"
"g nothing to do,"
 and afraid of 
getting in someo
ne’s way again
", galloped after"
 the adjutant. 
 “What’s ha
ppening here? Ma
y I come with yo
u?” he asked. 
  “One moment
", one moment!”"
 replied the adj
"utant, and ridin"
g up to a stout 
 colonel who was
 standing in the
" meadow, he gave"
 him some messag
e and then addr
essed Pierre.  
 “Why have you
" come here, Coun"
t?” he asked w
ith a smile. “
Still inquisiti
ve?”  “Yes
", yes,” assent"
ed Pierre.  Bu
t the adjutant t
urned his horse 
about and rode o
n.  “Here it
"’s tolerable,�"
"�� said he, “b"
ut with Bagrati�
�n on the left f
lank they’re 
getting it frigh
tfully hot.” 
 “Really?” 
said Pierre. “
Where is that?�
�  “Come alo
ng with me to ou
r knoll. We can 
get a view from 
there and in ou
r battery it is 
"still bearable,�"
�� said the adju
tant. “Will yo
u come?”  �
"�Yes, I’ll com"
"e with you,” r"
"eplied Pierre, l"
ooking round for
 his groom.  I
t was only now t
hat he noticed w
ounded men stagg
ering along or b
eing carried on
 stretchers. On 
that very meadow
 he had ridden o
ver the day bef
"ore, a soldier w"
as lying athwart
 the rows of sce
"nted hay, with h"
is head thrown 
awkwardly back a
nd his shako off
.  “Why have
n’t they carri
ed him away?” 
Pierre was about
" to ask, but see"
ing the stern e
xpression of the
 adjutant who wa
s also looking t
"hat way, he
che"
cked himself.  
 Pierre did not 
find his groom a
nd rode along th
e hollow with th
e adjutant to R
aévski’s Redo
ubt. His horse l
agged behind the
 adjutant’s a
nd jolted him at
 every step.  
“You don’t s
eem to be used t
"o riding, Count?"
” remarked the
 adjutant.  �
�No it’s not t
"hat, but her act"
ion seems so jer
"ky,” said Pier"
re in a puzzled
 tone.  “Why
... she’s woun
ded!” said the
 adjutant. “In
 the off foreleg
 above the knee
". A bullet, no d"
oubt. I congratu
"late you, Count,"
 on your baptism
 of fire!”  
 Having ridden i
n the smoke past
 the Sixth Corps
", behind the art"
illery which ha
d been moved for
ward and was in 
"action, deafenin"
g them with the 
 noise of firing
", they came to a"
 small wood. The
re it was cool a
"nd quiet,
with "
a scent of autum
n. Pierre and th
e adjutant dismo
unted and walked
 up the hill on
 foot.  “Is 
the general here
?” asked the a
djutant on reach
ing the knoll. 
 “He was here
 a minute ago bu
t has just gone 
"that way,” som"
"eone told him,
"
pointing to the 
right.  The ad
jutant looked at
 Pierre as if pu
zzled what to do
 with him now. 
 “Don’t tro
"uble about me,�"
� said Pierre. �
��I’ll go up o
nto the knoll if
 I may?”  �
"��Yes, do. You�"
�ll see everythi
ng from there an
d it’s less da
"ngerous, and
I�"
��ll come for yo
u.”  Pierre 
went to the batt
ery and the adju
tant rode on. Th
ey did not meet 
"
again, and only"
 much later did 
Pierre learn tha
t he lost an arm
 that day.  T
he knoll to whic
h Pierre ascende
d was that famou
s one afterwards
 known to the R
ussians as the K
noll Battery or 
Raévski’s Red
"oubt, and to the"
 French as la g
"rande redoute, l"
a fatale redoute
", la redoute du "
"centre,
around "
which tens of th
"ousands fell, an"
d which the Fren
ch regarded as 
the key to the w
hole position. 
 This redoubt c
onsisted of a kn
"oll, on three si"
des of which tre
nches had been 
dug. Within the 
entrenchment sto
od ten guns that
 were being fire
d through openi
ngs in the earth
work.  In line
 with the knoll 
on both sides st
ood other guns w
hich also fired 
 incessantly. A 
little behind th
e guns stood inf
antry. When asce
nding that knol
l Pierre had no 
notion that this
" spot, on which "
small trenches 
had been dug and
 from which a fe
w guns were firi
"ng, was the most"
 important poin
t of the battle.
  On the contr
"ary, just becaus"
e he happened to
 be there he tho
ught it one of 
the least signif
icant parts of t
he field.  Hav
ing reached the 
"knoll, Pierre sa"
t down at one en
d of a trench s
urrounding the b
attery and gazed
 at what was goi
ng on around him
 with an uncons
ciously happy sm
ile. Occasionall
y he rose and wa
lked about the 
battery still wi
th that same smi
"le, trying not t"
o obstruct the s
oldiers who wer
"e loading, hauli"
"ng the guns, and"
 continually run
ning past him w
ith bags and cha
rges. The guns o
f that battery w
ere being fired 
 continually one
 after another w
ith a deafening 
"roar, enveloping"
 the whole neig
hborhood in powd
er smoke.  In 
contrast with th
e dread felt by 
the infantrymen 
placed in suppor
"t,
here in the "
battery where a 
small number of 
men busy at thei
r work were sep
arated from the 
rest by a trench
", everyone exper"
ienced a common 
and as it were 
family feeling o
f animation.  
The intrusion of
 Pierre’s nonm
ilitary figure i
n a white hat ma
de an unpleasan
t impression at 
first. The soldi
ers looked askan
ce at him with 
surprise and eve
n alarm as they 
went past him. T
he senior artill
"ery
officer, a "
"tall, long-legge"
"d, pockmarked ma"
"n, moved over to"
 Pierre as if t
o see the action
 of the farthest
 gun and looked 
at him with curi
osity.  A youn
g round-faced of
"ficer, quite a b"
oy still and evi
dently only just
 out of the Cad
"et College, who "
was zealously co
mmanding the two
 guns entrusted
" to him, address"
ed Pierre sternl
"y.

“Sir,”"
" he said, “per"
mit me to ask yo
u to stand aside
. You must not b
e here.”  T
he soldiers shoo
k their heads di
sapprovingly as 
they looked at P
ierre. But when
 they had convin
ced themselves t
hat this man in 
the white hat w
as doing no harm
", but either sat"
 quietly on the 
slope of the tre
nch with a shy 
"smile or, polite"
ly making way fo
"r the soldiers, "
paced up and do
wn the battery u
nder fire as cal
mly as if he wer
e on a boulevard
",
their feeling"
 of hostile dist
rust gradually b
egan to change i
nto a kindly an
d bantering symp
"athy, such as so"
ldiers feel for 
"their dogs,
coc"
"ks, goats, and i"
n general for th
e animals that l
ive with the re
giment. The men 
soon accepted Pi
erre into their 
"family, adopted "
"him,
gave him a"
 nickname (“ou
"r gentleman”),"
 and made kindly
 fun of him amon
g themselves. 
 A shell tore u
p the earth two 
paces from Pierr
e and he looked 
around with a s
mile as he brush
ed from his clot
hes some earth i
t had thrown up.
  “And how�
�s it you’re n
"ot afraid, sir, "
really now?” a
" red-faced,
bro"
ad-shouldered so
ldier asked Pier
"re, with a grin "
that disclosed a
" set
of sound, "
white teeth.  
“Are you afrai
"d, then?” said"
 Pierre.  “W
hat else do you 
expect?” answe
red the soldier.
 “She has no m
"ercy, you
know!"
 When she comes 
spluttering down
", out go your in"
nards. One can�
�t help being a
"fraid,” he sai"
d laughing.  S
everal of the me
"n, with bright k"
"indly faces, sto"
pped beside Pier
re. They seemed
 not to have exp
ected him to tal
k like anybody e
"lse, and the
di"
scovery that he 
did so delighted
 them.  “It�
��s the business
 of us soldiers.
 But in a gentle
man it’s wonde
rful! There’s
 a gentleman for
 you!”  “T
o your places!�
� cried the youn
g officer to the
 men gathered ro
und Pierre.  
The young office
r was evidently 
exercising his d
uties for the fi
rst or second t
ime and therefor
e treated both h
is superiors and
 the men with g
reat precision a
nd formality.  
 The booming can
nonade and the f
usillade of musk
etry were growin
g more intense 
over the whole f
"ield, especially"
 to the left whe
re Bagratión’
s flèches were
", but where Pier"
re was the smoke
 of the firing m
ade it almost i
mpossible to dis
tinguish anythin
"g. Moreover, his"
 whole attentio
n was engrossed 
by watching the 
family circle—
separated from a
ll else—forme
d by the men in 
the battery. His
 first unconscio
us feeling of j
oyful animation 
produced by the 
sights and sound
s of the battlef
ield was now re
placed by anothe
"r, especially si"
nce he had seen 
that soldier ly
ing alone in the
" hayfield. Now, "
seated on the sl
ope of the trenc
"h, he
observed "
the faces of tho
se around him. 
 By ten o’clo
ck some twenty m
en had already b
een carried away
 from the batte
ry; two guns wer
e smashed and ca
nnon balls fell 
more and more f
requently on the
 battery and spe
nt bullets buzze
d and whistled a
round. But the 
men in the batte
ry seemed not to
" notice this, an"
d merry voices 
and jokes were h
eard on all side
s.  “A live 
one!” shouted 
a man as a whist
ling shell appro
ached.  “Not
 this way! To th
e infantry!” a
dded another wit
"h loud laughter,"
 seeing the she
ll fly past and 
fall into the ra
nks of the suppo
rts.  “Are y
ou bowing to a f
"riend, eh?” re"
"marked another, "
chaffing a peasa
nt who ducked l
ow as a cannon b
all flew over. 
 Several soldie
rs gathered by t
he wall of the t
"rench, looking o"
ut to see what 
was happening in
 front.  “Th
ey’ve withdraw
n the front line
", it has retired"
",” said they, "
pointing over t
he earthwork.  
 “Mind your ow
"n business,” a"
n old sergeant s
houted at them. 
“If they’ve 
 retired it’s 
because there’
s work for them 
to do farther ba
ck.”  And th
"e sergeant, taki"
ng one of the me
n by the shoulde
"rs, gave him a
"
shove with his k
nee. This was fo
llowed by a burs
t of laughter. 
 “To the fift
"h gun, wheel it "
up!” came shou
ts from one side
.  “Now then
", all together, "
like bargees!”
 rose the merry 
voices of those 
 who were moving
 the gun.  “
"Oh, she nearly k"
nocked our gentl
eman’s hat off
!” cried the r
ed-faced humori
"st, showing his "
teeth chaffing P
ierre. “Awkwar
d baggage!” he
 added reproach
fully to a canno
n ball that stru
ck a cannon whee
l and a man’s 
 leg.  “Now 
"then, you foxes!"
” said another
", laughing at so"
me militiamen wh
"o,
stooping low"
", entered the ba"
ttery to carry a
way the wounded 
man.  “So th
is gruel isn’t
 to your taste? 
"Oh, you crows! Y"
ou’re scared!�
�� they shouted
 at the militiam
en who stood hes
itating before t
he man whose leg
 had been torn 
off.  “There
", lads... oh, oh"
!” they mimick
"ed the peasants,"
 “they don’t
 like it at all
!”  Pierre n
oticed that afte
r every ball tha
t hit the redoub
"t, and after
ev"
"ery loss, the li"
veliness increas
ed more and more
.  As the flam
es of the fire h
idden within com
e more and more 
vividly and rap
idly from an app
roaching thunder
"cloud, so, as if"
 in opposition t
o what was taki
"ng place, the li"
ghtning of hidde
n fire growing m
ore and more in
tense glowed in 
the faces of the
se men.  Pierr
e did not look o
ut at the battle
field and was no
t concerned to k
now what was ha
ppening there; h
e was entirely a
bsorbed in watch
ing this fire w
hich burned ever
 more brightly a
nd which he felt
 was flaming up 
in the same way
 in his own soul
.  At ten o’
clock the infant
ry that had been
 among the bushe
s in front of t
he battery and a
long the Kámenk
a streamlet retr
eated. From the 
battery they co
uld be seen runn
ing back past it
 carrying their 
wounded on thei
r muskets. A gen
eral with his su
ite came to the 
"battery, and aft"
er speaking to 
the colonel gave
 Pierre an angry
 look and went a
way again havin
g ordered the in
fantry supports 
behind the batte
"ry to lie down,"
 so as to be les
s exposed to fir
e. After this fr
om amid the rank
s of infantry t
o the right of t
he battery came 
the sound of a d
rum and shouts 
"of command, and "
from the battery
 one saw how tho
se ranks of infa
ntry moved forw
ard.  Pierre l
ooked over the w
all of the trenc
h and was partic
ularly struck b
y a pale young o
"fficer who, lett"
ing his sword ha
"ng down, was wal"
king backwards 
and kept glancin
g uneasily aroun
d.  The ranks 
of the infantry 
disappeared amid
 the smoke but t
heir long-drawn
 shout and rapid
 musketry firing
 could still be 
heard. A few mi
nutes later crow
ds of wounded me
n and stretcher-
bearers came bac
k from that dir
ection. Projecti
les began to fal
l still more fre
quently in the 
battery. Several
 men were lying 
about who had no
t been removed. 
Around the cann
on the men moved
 still more bris
kly and busily. 
No one any long
er took notice o
f Pierre. Once o
r twice he was s
houted at for be
ing in the way.
 The senior offi
cer moved with b
"ig, rapid stride"
s from one gun 
to another with 
a frowning face.
 The young offic
"er, with his fac"
e still more fl
"ushed, commanded"
 the men more sc
rupulously than 
ever. The soldi
ers handed up th
"e charges, turne"
"d, loaded, and d"
id their busines
s with strained
 smartness. They
 gave little jum
ps as they walke
"d, as
though th"
ey were on sprin
gs.  The storm
cloud had come u
"pon them, and in"
 every face the 
fire which Pier
re had watched k
indle burned up 
brightly. Pierre
 standing beside
 the commanding
 officer. The yo
"ung officer, his"
 hand to his sha
"ko, ran up to
h"
is superior.  
“I have the ho
"nor to report, s"
"ir, that only ei"
ght rounds are l
eft. Are we to 
continue firing?
” he asked.  
 “Grapeshot!�
� the senior sho
"uted, without an"
swering the ques
"tion, looking
o"
ver the wall of 
the trench.  S
uddenly somethin
g happened: the 
young officer ga
ve a gasp and be
nding double sa
t down on the gr
ound like a bird
 shot on the win
g. Everything b
"ecame strange, c"
"onfused, and mis"
ty in Pierre’s
 eyes.  One ca
nnon ball after 
another whistled
 by and struck t
"he earthwork, a"
"
soldier, or a g"
"un. Pierre, who "
had not noticed 
these sounds bef
"ore,
now heard "
nothing else. On
 the right of th
e battery soldie
rs shouting “
Hurrah!” were 
running not forw
ards but backwar
"ds, it seemed to"
 Pierre.  A ca
nnon ball struck
 the very end of
 the earth work 
by which he was 
"
standing, crumb"
ling down the ea
rth; a black bal
l flashed before
 his eyes and a
t the same insta
nt plumped into 
something. Some 
militiamen who w
ere entering th
e battery ran ba
ck.  “All wi
th grapeshot!”
 shouted the off
icer.  The ser
geant ran up to 
the officer and 
in a frightened 
whisper informed
 him (as a butl
er at dinner inf
orms his master 
that there is no
 more of some w
ine asked for) t
hat there were n
o more charges. 
  “The scound
rels! What are t
hey doing?” sh
outed the office
"r, turning to
P"
ierre.  The of
ficer’s face w
as red and persp
iring and his ey
es glittered und
er his frowning
 brow.  “Run
 to the reserves
 and bring up th
e ammunition box
es!” he yelled
",
angrily avoid"
ing Pierre with 
his eyes and spe
aking to his men
.  “I’ll g
"o,” said Pierr"
e.  The office
"r, without answe"
"ring him, strode"
 across to the o
pposite side.  
 “Don’t fire
.... Wait!” he
 shouted.  The
 man who had bee
n ordered to go 
for ammunition s
tumbled against 
 Pierre.  “E
"h, sir, this is "
no place for you
",” said he, an"
d ran down the s
lope.  Pierre 
"ran after him, a"
voiding the spot
 where the young
 officer was si
tting.  One ca
"nnon ball, anoth"
"er, and a third "
"flew over him, f"
"alling in front,"
"
beside, and be"
hind him. Pierre
 ran down the sl
ope. “Where am
 I going?” he
 suddenly asked 
himself when he 
was already near
 the green ammun
ition wagons. H
e halted irresol
"utely, not knowi"
ng whether to re
turn or go on. 
Suddenly a terri
ble concussion t
hrew him backwar
ds to the ground
. At the same i
nstant he was da
zzled by a great
" flash of flame,"
 and immediately
 a deafening ro
"ar, crackling, a"
nd whistling mad
e his ears tingl
e.  When he ca
me to himself he
 was sitting on 
the ground leani
ng on his hands
; the ammunition
 wagons he had b
een approaching 
no longer existe
"d,
only charred"
 green boards an
d rags littered 
the scorched gra
"ss, and a
horse"
", dangling fragm"
ents of its shaf
"t behind it, gal"
"loped past, whil"
e another horse
" lay, like Pierr"
"e, on the ground"
", uttering prolo"
nged and pierci
ng cries.    
   CHAPTER XXX
II  Beside him
self with terror
 Pierre jumped u
p and ran back t
"o the battery,
"
as to the only r
efuge from the h
orrors that surr
ounded him.  O
n entering the e
arthwork he noti
ced that there w
ere men doing so
mething there b
ut that no shots
 were being fire
d from the batte
ry. He had no t
ime to realize w
ho these men wer
e. He saw the se
nior officer lyi
ng on the earth
 wall with his b
ack turned as if
 he were examini
ng something do
wn below and tha
t one of the sol
diers he had not
iced before was 
 struggling forw
ard shouting “
Brothers!” and
 trying to free 
himself from so
me men who were 
holding him by t
he arm. He also 
saw something el
se that was str
ange.  But he 
had not time to 
realize that the
 colonel had bee
"n killed, that
"
the soldier shou
ting “Brothers
!” was a priso
"ner, and that an"
other man had b
een bayoneted in
 the back before
" his eyes, for h"
ardly had he run
 into the redou
bt before a thin
", sallow-faced, "
perspiring man i
n a blue unifor
m rushed on him 
"sword in hand, s"
houting somethin
g. Instinctively
 guarding again
st the shock—f
or they had been
 running togethe
r at full speed
 before they saw
 one another—P
ierre put out hi
s hands and seiz
ed the man (a F
rench officer) b
y the shoulder w
ith one hand and
 by the throat 
with the other. 
"The officer, dro"
"pping his sword,"
 seized Pierre b
y his collar. 
 For some secon
ds they gazed wi
th frightened ey
es at one anothe
r’s unfamilia
r faces and both
 were perplexed 
at what they had
 done and what 
they were to do 
next. “Am I ta
ken prisoner or 
have I taken him
 prisoner?” e
ach was thinking
. But the French
 officer was evi
dently more inc
lined to think h
e had been taken
 prisoner becaus
e Pierre’s str
"ong
hand, impel"
led by instincti
"ve fear, squeeze"
d his throat eve
r tighter and t
ighter. The Fren
chman was about 
to say something
", when just abov"
"e their
heads, "
terrible and low
", a cannon ball "
"whistled, and it"
 seemed to Pierr
e that the Fren
ch officer’s h
ead had been tor
"n off, so swiftl"
y had he ducked
 it.  Pierre t
oo bent his head
 and let his han
ds fall. Without
 further thought
 as to who had 
taken whom priso
"ner, the Frenchm"
an ran back to t
he battery and 
Pierre ran down 
the slope stumbl
ing over the dea
d and wounded wh
"o,
it seemed to"
" him, caught at "
his feet. But be
fore he reached 
the foot of the
 knoll he was me
t by a dense cro
wd of Russian so
"ldiers who,
stu"
"mbling, tripping"
" up, and shoutin"
"g, ran merrily a"
nd wildly toward
 the battery. (
This was the att
ack for which Er
mólov claimed t
"he credit,
decl"
aring that only 
his courage and 
good luck made s
uch a feat possi
ble: it was the
 attack in which
 he was said to 
have thrown some
 St. George’s 
 Crosses he had 
in his pocket in
to the battery f
or the first sol
diers to take w
ho got there.) 
 The French who
 had occupied th
"e battery fled, "
and our troops s
houting “Hurr
ah!” pursued t
hem so far beyon
d the battery th
at it was diffic
ult to call the
m back.  The p
risoners were br
ought down from 
the battery and 
among them was 
a wounded French
" general, whom t"
he officers surr
ounded. Crowds o
f wounded—som
e known to Pierr
e and some unkno
wn—Russians an
"d French,
with "
faces distorted 
"by suffering, wa"
"lked, crawled, a"
nd were carried 
on stretchers f
rom the battery.
 Pierre again we
nt up onto the k
noll where he h
ad spent over an
" hour, and of th"
at family circle
 which had recei
ved him as a me
mber he did not 
find a single on
e. There were ma
ny dead whom he
" did not know, b"
ut some he recog
nized. The young
 officer still s
at in the same 
"way, bent double"
", in a pool of b"
lood at the edge
 of the earth w
all. The red-fac
ed man was still
" twitching, but "
they did not car
ry him away.  
 Pierre ran down
 the slope once 
more.  “Now 
they will stop i
"t, now they will"
 be horrified at
 what they have 
 done!” he tho
"ught, aimlessly "
going toward a c
rowd of stretche
r bearers movin
g from the battl
efield.  But b
ehind the veil o
f smoke the sun 
"was still high, "
and in front and
 especially to 
"the left, near S"
"emënovsk, somet"
hing seemed to b
e seething in t
"he smoke, and th"
e roar of cannon
 and musketry di
"d not diminish, "
but even increa
sed to desperati
on like a man wh
"o, straining him"
"self, shrieks
w"
ith all his rema
ining strength. 
      CHAPT
ER XXXIII  The
 chief action of
 the battle of B
orodinó was fou
ght within the s
even thousand f
eet between Boro
dinó and Bagrat
ión’s flèche
s. Beyond that 
"space there was,"
 on the one side
", a demonstratio"
n made by the Ru
ssians with Uv�
�rov’s cavalry
" at midday, and "
on the other sid
"e, beyond Utíts"
"a,
Poniatowski�"
��s collision wi
th Túchkov; but
 these two were 
detached and fe
eble actions in 
comparison with 
what took place 
in the center of
 the battlefiel
d. On the field 
between Borodin�
� and the flèch
"es, beside the
"
"wood, the chief "
action of the da
y took place on 
an open space vi
sible from both
 sides and was f
ought in the sim
plest and most a
rtless way.  T
he battle began 
on both sides wi
th a cannonade f
rom several hund
red guns.  Th
en when the whol
e field was cove
"red with smoke, "
"two divisions,
"
Campan’s and D
"essaix’s, adva"
nced from the Fr
"ench right, whil"
e Murat’s tro
ops advanced on 
Borodinó from t
heir left.  Fr
om the Shevárdi
no Redoubt where
 Napoleon was st
anding the flèc
hes were two th
irds of a mile a
"way, and it was "
more than a mile
 as the crow fli
es to Borodinó
", so that Napole"
on could not see
 what was happen
"ing there,
espe"
cially as the sm
oke mingling wit
h the mist hid t
he whole localit
y. The soldiers
 of Dessaix’s 
division advanci
ng against the f
lèches could o
nly be seen till
 they had entere
d the hollow tha
t lay between th
em and the flè
ches. As soon as
 they had descen
ded into that ho
"llow, the smoke"
 of the guns and
 musketry on the
 flèches grew s
o dense that it 
covered the who
le approach on t
hat side of it. 
Through the smok
e glimpses could
 be caught of s
omething black�
�probably men—
and at times the
 glint of bayon
ets. But whether
 they were movin
"g or stationary,"
 whether they we
re French or Ru
"ssian, could not"
 be discovered f
rom the Shevárd
ino Redoubt.  
The sun had rise
n brightly and i
ts slanting rays
 struck straight
 into Napoleon�
"��s face as, sha"
ding his eyes wi
"th his hand, he "
looked at the f
lèches. The smo
ke spread out be
"fore them, and a"
t times it looke
d as if the smo
"ke were moving, "
at times as if t
he troops moved.
 Sometimes shout
s were heard th
rough the firing
", but it was imp"
ossible to tell 
what was being 
done there.  N
"apoleon, standin"
"g on the knoll, "
looked through a
" field glass, an"
d in its small 
circlet saw smok
"e and men, somet"
imes his own and
 sometimes Russ
"ians, but when h"
e looked again w
ith the naked ey
"e, he could not "
tell where what
 he had seen was
.  He descende
d the knoll and 
began walking up
 and down before
 it.  Occasion
"ally he stopped,"
 listened to the
" firing, and gaz"
ed intently at 
the battlefield.
  But not only
 was it impossib
le to make out w
hat was happenin
g from where he
 was standing do
"wn below, or fro"
m the knoll abov
e on which some 
of his generals
 had taken their
" stand, but even"
 from the flèch
es themselves—
in which by thi
s time there wer
e now Russian an
d now French sol
"diers,
alternat"
"ely or together,"
" dead, wounded, "
"alive, frightene"
"d, or
maddened�"
��even at those 
flèches themsel
ves it was impos
sible to make ou
t what was taki
ng place. There 
for several hour
s amid incessant
 cannon and mus
"ketry fire, now "
Russians were se
"en alone, now Fr"
"enchmen alone, n"
"ow
infantry, an"
d now cavalry: t
"hey appeared, fi"
"red, fell, colli"
"ded, not
knowin"
g what to do wit
"h one another, s"
"creamed, and ran"
 back again.  
From the battlef
ield adjutants h
"e had sent out, "
and orderlies fr
om his marshals
", kept galloping"
 up to Napoleon 
with reports of 
the progress of
" the action, but"
 all these repor
"ts were false, b"
oth because it w
as impossible i
n the heat of ba
ttle to say what
 was happening a
t any given mom
ent and because 
many of the adju
tants did not go
 to the actual p
lace of conflic
t but reported w
hat they had hea
rd from others; 
and also becaus
e while an adjut
ant was riding m
ore than a mile 
to Napoleon cir
cumstances chang
ed and the news 
he brought was a
lready becoming 
 false. Thus an 
adjutant gallope
d up from Murat 
with tidings tha
t Borodinó had
 been occupied a
nd the bridge ov
er the Kolochá 
was in the hand
s of the French.
 The adjutant as
ked whether Napo
leon wished the 
 troops to cross
 it? Napoleon ga
ve orders that t
he troops should
 form up on the
 farther side an
d wait. But befo
re that order wa
s given—almost
 as soon in fac
t as the adjutan
t had left Borod
inó—the bridg
e had been reta
ken by the Russi
"ans and burned, "
in the very skir
mish at which Pi
erre had been p
resent at the be
ginning of the b
attle.  An adj
utant galloped u
p from the flèc
hes with a pale 
and frightened f
ace and reporte
d to Napoleon th
at their attack 
had been repulse
"d, Campan
wound"
"ed, and Davout k"
illed; yet at th
e very time the 
adjutant had bee
n told that the
 French had been
" repulsed, the f"
lèches had in f
act been recapt
ured by other Fr
"ench troops, and"
 Davout was aliv
e and only slig
htly bruised. On
 the basis of th
ese necessarily 
untrustworthy r
eports Napoleon 
"gave his orders,"
 which had eithe
r been executed 
before he gave 
them or could no
t be and were no
t executed.  T
he marshals and 
"generals, who we"
re nearer to the
 field of battle
"
but, like Napo"
"leon, did not ta"
ke part in the a
ctual fighting a
nd only occasio
nally went withi
"n musket range, "
made their own a
rrangements wit
hout asking Napo
leon and issued 
orders where and
 in what directi
on to fire and 
where cavalry sh
ould gallop and 
infantry should 
run. But even t
"heir orders, lik"
"e Napoleon’s, "
were seldom carr
"ied out, and the"
n but partially
. For the most p
art things happe
ned contrary to 
their orders. S
oldiers ordered 
to advance ran b
ack on meeting g
rapeshot; soldie
rs ordered to r
emain where they
" were, suddenly,"
 seeing Russians
 unexpectedly b
"efore them, some"
times rushed bac
k and sometimes 
"forward,
and th"
e cavalry dashed
 without orders 
in pursuit of th
e flying Russian
s. In this way 
two cavalry regi
ments galloped t
hrough the Semë
novsk hollow an
d as soon as the
y reached the to
p of the incline
 turned round an
d galloped full
 speed back agai
n. The infantry 
moved in the sam
"e way,
sometime"
s running to qui
te other places 
than those they 
were ordered to 
 go to. All orde
rs as to where a
nd when to move 
"the guns, when t"
o send infantry
 to shoot or hor
semen to ride do
wn the Russian i
nfantry—all s
uch orders were 
given by the off
icers on the spo
t nearest to the
 units concerne
"d, without askin"
"g either Ney, Da"
"vout, or Murat, "
much less Napol
eon. They did no
t fear getting i
nto trouble for 
not fulfilling 
orders or for ac
ting on their ow
"n initiative, fo"
r in battle what
 is at stake is
 what is dearest
 to man—his ow
n life—and it 
sometimes seems 
that safety lie
s in running bac
"k, sometimes in "

" however, all th"

     CHAPTE
R XXXIV  Napol
eon’s generals
"—Davout, Ney, "
"and Murat, who w"
ere near that re
gion of fire an
d sometimes even
 entered it—re
peatedly led int
o it huge masses
 of well-ordere
d troops. But co
ntrary to what h
ad always happen
ed in their for
"mer battles, ins"
tead of the news
 they expected o
f the enemy’s 
"flight,
these o"
rderly masses re
turned thence as
 disorganized an
d terrified mobs
. The generals 
"re-formed them, "
but their number
s constantly dec
reased. In the 
middle of the da
y Murat sent his
 adjutant to Nap
oleon to demand 
 reinforcements.
  Napoleon sat
 at the foot of 
"the knoll, drink"
"ing punch, when "
Murat’s adjut
ant galloped up 
with an assuranc
e that the Russi
ans would be rou
ted if His Maje
sty would let hi
m have another d
ivision.  “R
einforcements?�
� said Napoleon 
in a tone of ste
"rn surprise, loo"
king at the adj
utant—a handso
me lad with long
 black curls arr
anged like Murat
’s own—as t
hough he did not
 understand his 
words.  “Rei
nforcements!” 
thought Napoleon
 to himself. “
How can they nee
d reinforcement
s when they alre
ady have half th
e army directed 
"against a
weak,"
 unentrenched Ru
ssian wing?” 
 “Tell the Ki
"ng of Naples,”"
 said he sternly
", “that it is "
"not noon yet,
a"
nd I don’t yet
 see my chessboa
rd clearly. Go!.
..”  The han
dsome boy adjuta
nt with the long
 hair sighed dee
ply without rem
oving his hand f
rom his hat and 
galloped back to
 where men were 
being slaughter
ed.  Napoleon 
rose and having 
summoned Caulain
court and Berthi
er began talkin
g to them about 
matters unconnec
ted with the bat
tle.  In the m
idst of this con
"versation, which"
 was beginning t
o interest Napo
"leon, Berthier�"
�s eyes turned t
o look at a gene
ral with a suite
", who
was gallo"
ping toward the 
knoll on a lathe
ring horse. It w
as Belliard. Ha
ving dismounted 
he went up to th
e Emperor with r
apid strides and
 in a loud voic
e began boldly d
emonstrating the
 necessity of se
nding reinforce
ments. He swore 
on his honor tha
t the Russians w
ere lost if the 
 Emperor would g
ive another divi
sion.  Napoleo
n shrugged his s
houlders and con
tinued to pace u
p and down with
out replying. Be
lliard began tal
king loudly and 
eagerly to the 
generals of the 
suite around him
.  “You are 
"very fiery, Bell"
"iard,” said Na"
"poleon, when he "
again came up to
 the general. �
��In the heat of
 a battle it is 
easy to make a m
istake. Go and 
have another loo
k and then come 
back to me.” 
 Before Belliar
d was out of sig
"ht, a messenger "
from another par
t of the battle
field galloped u
p.  “Now the
"n, what do you w"
ant?” asked Na
poleon in the to
ne of a man irr
itated at being 
continually dist
urbed.  “Sir
"e, the prince..."
” began the ad
jutant.  “As
ks for reinforce
ments?” said N
apoleon with an 
angry gesture. 
 The adjutant b
ent his head aff
irmatively and b
"egan to report, "
but the Emperor
 turned from him
", took a couple "
"of steps, stoppe"
"d, came back, an"
d called Berthi
er.  “We mus
"t give reserves,"
"” he said, mov"
ing his arms sli
ghtly apart. �
�Who do you thin
k should be sent
 there?” he as
ked of Berthier 
(whom he subseq
uently termed �
�that gosling I 
have made an eag
le”).  “Se
nd Claparède’
"s division, sire"
",” replied Ber"
"thier, who knew "
all the divisio
"n’s regiments,"
 and battalions 
by heart.  Nap
oleon nodded ass
ent.  The adju
tant galloped to
 Claparède’s 
division and a f
ew minutes later
 the Young Guar
ds stationed beh
ind the knoll mo
ved forward. Nap
oleon gazed sil
ently in that di
rection.  “N
o!” he suddenl
y said to Berthi
er. “I can’t
 send Claparède
. Send Friant�
�s division.” 
  Though there 
was no advantage
 in sending Fria
nt’s division 
instead of Clap
"arède’s, and "
even an obvious 
inconvenience an
d delay in stopp
ing Claparède 
and sending Fria
"nt now, the orde"
r was carried ou
t exactly. Napo
leon did not not
ice that in rega
rd to his army h
e was playing t
he part of a doc
tor who hinders 
by his medicines
—a role he so 
justly understo
od and condemned
.  Friant’s 
division disappe
ared as the othe
rs had done into
 the smoke of t
he battlefield. 
From all sides a
djutants continu
ed to arrive at 
a gallop and as
 if by agreement
 all said the sa
me thing. They a
ll asked for re
inforcements and
 all said that t
he Russians were
 holding their 
positions and ma
intaining a hell
ish fire under w
hich the French 
army was meltin
g away.  Napol
eon sat on a cam
"pstool, wrapped "
in thought.  M
". de Beausset, t"
he man so fond o
"f travel, having"
 fasted since mo
"rning,
came up "
to the Emperor a
nd ventured resp
ectfully to sugg
est lunch to His
 Majesty.  �
�I hope I may no
w congratulate Y
our Majesty on a
 victory?” sai
d he.  Napoleo
n silently shook
 his head in neg
ation. Assuming 
the negation to 
 refer only to t
he victory and n
"ot to the lunch,"
 M. de Beausset 
ventured with r
espectful jocula
rity to remark t
hat there is no 
reason for not 
having lunch whe
n one can get it
.  “Go away.
..” exclaimed 
Napoleon suddenl
"y and morosely, "
and turned aside
.  A beatific 
"smile of regret,"
" repentance, and"
 ecstasy beamed 
on M. de Beauss
et’s face and 
he glided away t
o the other gene
rals.  Napoleo
n was experienci
ng a feeling of 
depression like 
that of an ever
-lucky gambler w
"ho, after reckle"
ssly flinging mo
ney about and al
"ways
winning, s"
uddenly just whe
n he has calcula
ted all the chan
ces of the game
", finds that the"
 more he conside
rs his play the 
more surely he 
loses.  His tr
oops were the sa
"me, his generals"
" the same, the s"
ame preparations
"
had been made,"
 the same dispos
"itions, and the "
same proclamatio
n courte et én
"ergique, he hims"
elf was still th
e same: he knew 
that and knew th
at he was now e
ven more experie
nced and skillfu
l than before. E
ven the enemy w
as the same as a
t Austerlitz and
 Friedland—yet
 the terrible s
troke of his arm
 had supernatura
lly become impot
ent.  All the 
old methods that
 had been unfail
ingly crowned wi
th success: the 
 concentration o
f batteries on o
"ne point, an att"
ack by reserves 
to break the en
"emy’s line, an"
d a cavalry atta
ck by “the men
" of iron,” all"
 these methods 
had already been
" employed, yet n"
ot only was ther
"e no victory,
b"
ut from all side
s came the same 
news of generals
 killed and woun
"ded,
of reinfor"
"cements needed, "
of the impossibi
lity of driving 
back the Russia
"ns, and of disor"
ganization among
 his own troops.
"

Formerly, af"
ter he had given
 two or three or
ders and uttered
" a
few phrases,"
 marshals and ad
jutants had come
 galloping up wi
th congratulati
ons and happy fa
"ces, announcing "
the trophies tak
"en, the
corps o"
"f prisoners, bun"
dles of enemy ea
gles and standar
"ds, cannon and
"
"stores, and Mura"
t had only begge
d leave to loose
 the cavalry to 
gather in the b
aggage wagons. S
o it had been at
" Lodi, Marengo, "
"Arcola, Jena,
A"
"usterlitz, Wagra"
"m, and so on. Bu"
t now something 
strange was happ
ening to his tr
oops.  Despite
 news of the cap
ture of the flè
"ches, Napoleon s"
aw that this was
"
not the same, "
not at all the s
"ame, as what had"
 happened in his
 former battles
. He saw that wh
at he was feelin
g was felt by al
l the men about 
 him experienced
 in the art of w
ar. All their fa
ces looked dejec
"ted, and
they a"
ll shunned one a
nother’s eyes�
��only a de Beau
sset could fail 
to grasp the me
aning of what wa
s happening.  
But Napoleon wit
h his long exper
ience of war wel
l knew the meani
ng of a battle 
not gained by th
e attacking side
" in eight hours,"
 after all effo
rts had been exp
ended. He knew t
hat it was a los
t battle and tha
t the least acc
ident might now�
��with the fight
 balanced on suc
h a strained ce
nter—destroy h
im and his army.
  When he ran 
his mind over th
e whole of this 
strange Russian 
campaign in whi
ch not one battl
"e had been won, "
and in which not
" a flag, or cann"
"on,
or army cor"
ps had been capt
ured in two mont
"hs, when he look"
ed at the conce
aled depression 
on the faces aro
und him and hear
d reports of the
 Russians still
 holding their g
round—a terrib
le feeling like 
a nightmare too
k possession of 
"him, and all the"
 unlucky acciden
ts that might de
stroy him occur
red to his mind.
 The Russians mi
ght fall on his 
"left wing,
migh"
t break through 
"his center, he h"
imself might be 
killed by a stra
y cannon ball. 
All this was pos
sible. In former
 battles he had 
only considered
 the possibiliti
"es of success, b"
ut now innumerab
le unlucky chan
ces presented th
"emselves, and he"
 expected them a
"ll. Yes, it was "
like a dream in
 which a man fan
cies that a ruff
ian is coming to
" attack him,
an"
d raises his arm
 to strike that 
ruffian a terrib
le blow which he
 knows should a
"nnihilate him, b"
ut then feels th
at his arm drops
 powerless and 
"limp like a rag,"
 and the horror 
of unavoidable d
estruction seize
s him in his he
lplessness.  T
he news that the
 Russians were a
ttacking the lef
t flank of the F
rench army arou
sed that horror 
in Napoleon. He 
sat silently on 
a campstool bel
"ow the knoll, wi"
th head bowed an
d elbows on his 
knees. Berthier 
 approached and 
suggested that t
hey should ride 
along the line t
o ascertain the
 position of aff
airs.  “What
? What do you sa
y?” asked Napo
"leon. “Yes, te"
ll them to bring
 me my horse.�
�  He mounted 
and rode toward 
Semënovsk.  A
mid the powder s
"moke, slowly dis"
persing over the
 whole space thr
ough which Napo
"leon rode, horse"
s and men were l
ying in pools of
" blood, singly
"
or in heaps. Nei
ther Napoleon no
r any of his gen
erals had ever b
efore seen such
 horrors or so m
any slain in suc
h a small area. 
The roar of gun
"s, that had not "
ceased for ten h
"ours, wearied th"
e ear and gave 
a peculiar signi
ficance to the s
"pectacle, as mus"
ic does to table
aux vivants. Na
poleon rode up t
he high ground a
"t Semënovsk, an"
d through the s
moke saw ranks o
f men in uniform
s of a color unf
amiliar to him. 
They were Russi
ans.  The Russ
ians stood in se
rried ranks behi
nd Semënovsk vi
llage and its k
"noll, and their "
guns boomed ince
ssantly along th
eir line and sen
t forth clouds 
of smoke. It was
 no longer a bat
tle: it was a co
ntinuous slaugh
ter which could 
be of no avail e
ither to the Fre
nch or the Russ
ians. Napoleon s
topped his horse
 and again fell 
into the reverie
 from which Ber
thier had arouse
d him. He could 
not stop what wa
s going on befo
re him and aroun
d him and was su
pposed to be dir
ected by him and
 to depend on h
"im, and from its"
 lack of success
" this affair, fo"
r the first tim
"e, seemed to him"
 unnecessary and
 horrible.  On
e of the general
s rode up to Nap
oleon and ventur
ed to offer to l
ead the Old Gua
rd into action. 
Ney and Berthier
", standing near "
"Napoleon,
excha"
nged looks and s
miled contemptuo
usly at this gen
eral’s sensele
ss offer.  Na
poleon bowed his
 head and remain
ed silent a long
 time.  “At 
eight hundred le
agues from Franc

ve my Guard des
troyed!” he sa
"id, and turning "
his horse rode b

HAPTER XXXV  O
n the rug-covere
d bench where Pi
erre had seen hi
m in the morning
" sat
Kutúzov, "
his gray head ha
"nging, his heavy"
 body relaxed. H
e gave no order
"s, but only asse"
nted to or disse
nted from what o
thers suggested.
"

“Yes, yes,"
" do that,” he "
replied to vario
us proposals. �
"�Yes, yes: go,
"
"dear boy, and ha"
"ve a look,” he"
 would say to on
e or another of 
those about him
"; or, “No, don"
"’t, we’d bet"
ter wait!” He 
listened to the 
reports that we
re brought him a
nd gave directio
ns when his subo
rdinates demande
d that of him; 
but when listeni
ng to the report
s it seemed as i
f he were not i
nterested in the
 import of the w
"ords spoken, but"
 rather in some
thing else—in 
the expression o
f face and tone 
of voice of thos
e who were repo
rting. By long y
ears of military
 experience he k
"new, and with
t"
he wisdom of age
" understood, tha"
t it is impossib
le for one man t
o direct hundre
ds of thousands 
of others strugg
"ling with death,"
 and he knew th
at the result of
 a battle is dec
ided not by the 
orders of a com
"mander in chief,"
 nor the place w
here the troops 
"are stationed, n"
or by the numbe
r of cannon or o
f slaughtered me
"n, but by that i"
ntangible force 
 called the spir
"it of the army, "
and he watched t
his force and gu
ided it in as f
ar as that was i
n his power.  
Kutúzov’s gen
eral expression 
was one of conce
ntrated quiet at
"tention,
and hi"
s face wore a st
rained look as i
f he found it di
fficult to maste
r the fatigue o
f his old and fe
eble body.  At
 eleven o’cloc
k they brought h
im news that the
 flèches captur
ed by the Frenc
h had been retak
"en, but that Pri"
nce Bagratión w
as wounded. Kut�
�zov groaned an
d swayed his hea
d.  “Ride ov
er to Prince Pet
er Ivánovich an
d find out about
" it exactly,” "
he said to one 
of his adjutants
", and then turne"
d to the Duke of
 Württemberg w
ho was standing 
behind him.  �
��Will Your High
ness please take
 command of the 
first army?” 
 Soon after the
 duke’s depart
ure—before he 
could possibly h
ave reached Sem
ënovsk—his ad
jutant came back
 from him and to
ld Kutúzov that
 the duke asked
 for more troops
.  Kutúzov ma
de a grimace and
 sent an order t
o Dokhtúrov to 
take over the c
ommand of the fi
"rst army, and a "
request to the d
uke—whom he sa
id he could not
 spare at such a
n important mome
nt—to return t
o him. When the
y brought him ne
ws that Murat ha
d been taken pri
"soner, and the s"
taff officers c
ongratulated him
", Kutúzov smile"
d.  “Wait a 
"little, gentleme"
"n,” said he. �"
��The battle is 
"won, and there i"
s nothing extra
ordinary in the 
capture of Murat
". Still, it is b"
etter to wait b
efore we rejoice
.”  But he s
ent an adjutant 
to take the news
 round the army.
  When Scherb�
�nin came gallop
ing from the lef
t flank with new
s that the Fren
ch had captured 
the flèches and
 the village of 
"Semënovsk, Kut�"
"�zov,
guessing "
by the sounds of
 the battle and 
by Scherbínin�
�s looks that th
"e
news was bad,"
 rose as if to s
tretch his legs 
"and, taking Sche"
rbínin’s arm
", led him aside."
"

“Go, my de"
"ar fellow,” he"
 said to Ermólo
"v, “and see wh"
ether something 
 can’t be done
.”  Kutúzov
" was in Górki, "
near the center 
of the Russian p
osition. The at
tack directed by
 Napoleon agains
t our left flank
 had been severa

d. In the center
 the French had 
not got beyond B
"orodinó,
and o"
n their left fla
nk Uvárov’s c
avalry had put t
he French to fli
ght.  Toward t
hree o’clock t
he French attack
s ceased. On the
 faces of all w
ho came from the
 field of battle
", and of those w"
ho stood around 
"him,
Kutúzov n"
oticed an expres
sion of extreme 
tension. He was 
satisfied with 
the day’s succ
ess—a success 
exceeding his ex
"pectations, but "
the old man’s
 strength was fa
iling him. Sever

" And you,” he "

  While Kutúzo

W"
olzogen returned
 from Barclay an

ral Barclay wish

"túzov, without "

former commander
" in chief, to av"
oid personal re

"ext day, immedia"

was far from bei

 the farthest l

 even resemble w
hat Kutúzov had

CHAPTER XXXVI  
 Prince Andrew�
�s regiment was 
among the reserv
es which till af
ter one o’clo
ck were statione
d inactive behin
"d Semënovsk, un"
der heavy artill
ery fire. Towar
d two o’clock 
"the regiment, ha"
ving already los
t more than two
" hundred men, wa"
s moved forward 
into a trampled 
oatfield in the 
gap between Sem
ënovsk and the 
"Knoll Battery, w"
here thousands o
f men perished 
that day and on 
which an intense
", concentrated f"
ire from several
 hundred enemy 
guns was directe
d between one an
d two o’clock.
  Without movi
ng from that spo
t or firing a si
ngle shot the re
giment here los
t another third 
of its men. From
 in front and es
pecially from th
"e
right, in the"
 unlifting smoke
 the guns boomed
", and out of the"
 mysterious dom
ain of smoke tha
t overlay the wh
ole space in fro
"nt, quick hissin"
g cannon balls 
and slow whistli
ng shells flew u
nceasingly. At t
"imes, as
if to "
allow them a res
"pite, a quarter "
of an hour passe
d during which 
the cannon balls
 and shells all 
"flew overhead, b"
ut sometimes sev
eral men were t
orn from the reg
iment in a minut
e and the slain 
were continually
 being dragged 
away and the wou
nded carried off
.  With each f
resh blow less a
nd less chance o
f life remained 
for those not y
et killed. The r
egiment stood in
 columns of batt
"alion, three hun"
dred paces apar
"t, but neverthel"
ess the men were
 always in one a
nd the same moo
d. All alike wer
e taciturn and m
orose. Talk was 
rarely heard in 
"the
ranks, and "
it ceased altoge
ther every time 
the thud of a su
ccessful shot a
nd the cry of �
�stretchers!” 
was heard. Most 
"of the time, by "
their officers�
"�� order, the me"
n sat on the gro
"und. One, having"
 taken off his 
"shako, carefully"
 loosened the ga
thers of its lin
ing and drew the
m tight again; 
"another, rubbing"
 some dry clay b
etween his palms
", polished
his "
bayonet; another
 fingered the st
rap and pulled t
he buckle of his
"
bandolier, whi"
le another smoot
hed and refolded
 his leg bands a
nd put his boot
s on again. Some
 built little ho
uses of the tuft
s in the plowed 
"
ground, or plai"
ted baskets from
 the straw in th
e cornfield. All
 seemed fully a
bsorbed in these
 pursuits. When 
men were killed 
"or wounded, when"
 rows of stretc
"hers went past, "
when some troops
" retreated, and "
when great mass
es of the enemy 
came into view t
hrough the smoke
", no one paid an"
y attention to 
these things. Bu
t when our artil
lery or cavalry 
advanced or som
e of our infantr
y were seen to m
"ove forward, wor"
ds of approval 
were heard on al
l sides. But the
 liveliest atten
tion was attract
ed by occurrenc
es quite apart f
"rom, and unconne"
"cted with, the b"
attle. It was a
s if the minds o
f these morally 
exhausted men fo
und relief in ev
"eryday,
commonp"
lace occurrences
. A battery of a
rtillery was pas
sing in front of
 the regiment. 
The horse of an 
ammunition cart 
put its leg over
 a trace. “He
"y, look at the t"
race horse!... G
et her leg out! 
She’ll fall...
". Ah,
they don�"
��t see it!” c
ame identical sh
outs from the ra
nks all along th
e regiment. Ano
"ther time, gener"
al attention was
 attracted by a 
small brown dog
", coming heaven "
"knows whence, wh"
ich trotted in a
 preoccupied man
ner in front of
 the ranks with 
tail stiffly ere
ct till suddenly
 a shell fell c
"lose by, when it"
" yelped, tucked "
its tail between
" its legs, and d"
arted aside. Ye
lls and shrieks 
of laughter rose
 from the whole 
regiment. But s
uch distractions
 lasted only a m
"oment, and for e"
ight hours the m
en had been ina
"ctive, without f"
"ood, in constant"
" fear of death, "
and their pale 
and gloomy faces
 grew ever paler
 and gloomier. 
"
Prince Andrew,"
 pale and gloomy
 like everyone i
"n the regiment, "
paced up and do
wn from the bord
er of one patch 
"to another, at t"
he edge of the 
meadow beside an
" oatfield, with "
head bowed and a
rms behind his b
ack. There was 
nothing for him 
to do and no ord
ers to be given.
 Everything wen
t on of itself. 
The killed were 
dragged from the
" front, the woun"
ded carried awa
"y, and the ranks"
 closed up. If a
ny soldiers ran 
to the rear the
y returned immed
iately and hasti
ly. At first Pri
"nce Andrew,
con"
sidering it his 
duty to rouse th
e courage of the
 men and to set 
them an example
", walked about a"
"mong the ranks, "
but he soon beca
me convinced th
at this was unne
cessary and that
 there was nothi
ng he could teac
h them. All the
 powers of his s
"oul, as of every"
" soldier there, "
were unconsciou
sly bent on avoi
ding the contemp
lation of the ho
rrors of their 
situation. He wa
lked along the m
"eadow, dragging "
"his feet, rustli"
"ng the
grass, a"
nd gazing at the
 dust that cover
ed his boots; no
w he took big s
trides trying to
 keep to the foo
tprints left on 
the meadow by th
"e
mowers, then "
he counted his s
"teps, calculatin"
g how often he m
ust walk from o
ne strip to anot
her to walk a mi
"le, then he stri"
pped the flowers
 from the wormw
ood that grew al
ong a boundary r
"ut, rubbed them "
"in his
palms, a"
nd smelled their
" pungent, sweetl"
y bitter scent. 
Nothing remained
 of the previou
s day’s though
ts. He thought o
f nothing. He li
stened with wea
ry ears to the e
ver-recurring so
"unds, distinguis"
hing the whistle
 of flying proj
ectiles from the
 booming of the 
"reports, glanced"
 at the tiresom
ely familiar fac
es of the men of
 the first batta
"lion, and
waite"
d. “Here it co
mes... this one 
is coming our wa
y again!” he t
"hought,
listeni"
ng to an approac
hing whistle in 
the hidden regio
n of smoke. “O
"ne,
another! Ag"
ain! It has hit.
...” He stoppe
d and looked at 
the ranks. “No
",
it has gone o"
ver. But this on
e has hit!” An
d again he start
ed trying to re
ach the boundary
 strip in sixtee
n paces. A whizz
 and a thud! Fiv
e paces from hi
"m, a cannon ball"
 tore up the dry
 earth and disap
peared. A chill
 ran down his ba
ck. Again he gla
nced at the rank
s. Probably many
 had been hit�
�a large crowd h
ad gathered near
 the second batt
alion.  “Adj
utant!” he sho
uted. “Order t
hem not to crowd
 together.”  
"
The adjutant, h"
aving obeyed thi
"s instruction, a"
pproached Prince
 Andrew. From t
he other side a 
battalion comman
der rode up.  
“Look out!” 
came a frightene
d cry from a sol
"dier and, like a"
 bird whirring 
in rapid flight 
and alighting on
" the ground, a s"
hell dropped wi
th little noise 
within two steps
 of Prince Andre
w and close to t
he battalion co
mmander’s hors
e. The horse fir
"st, regardless o"
f whether it wa
s right or wrong
" to show fear, s"
"norted, reared a"
lmost throwing t
"he
major, and g"
alloped aside. T
he horse’s ter
ror infected the
 men.  “Lie 
down!” cried t
"he adjutant, thr"
owing himself fl
at on the ground
.  Prince Andr
ew hesitated. Th
e smoking shell 
spun like a top 
between him and
 the prostrate a
"djutant, near a "
wormwood plant b
etween the field
 and the meadow
.  “Can this
 be death?” th
ought Prince And
"rew, looking wit"
"h a quite new,
"
envious glance a
"t the grass, the"
" wormwood, and t"
he streamlet of 
smoke that curl
ed up from the r
otating black ba
"ll. “I cannot,"
 I do not wish t
o die. I love l
ife—I love thi
"s grass, this ea"
"rth, this air..."
.” He thought 
"
this, and at th"
e same time reme
mbered that peop
le were looking 
at him.  “It
"’s shameful, s"
ir!” he said t
o the adjutant. 
“What...”  
 He did not fini
sh speaking. At 
one and the same
 moment came the
 sound of an ex
"plosion, a whist"
le of splinters 
as from a breaki
"ng window frame,"
 a suffocating 
"smell of powder,"
 and Prince Andr
ew started to on
"e side,
raising"
" his arm, and fe"
ll on his chest.
 Several officer
s ran up to him.
 From the right
 side of his abd
"omen, blood was "
welling out maki
ng a large stai
n on the grass. 
  The militiame
n with stretcher
s who were calle
d up stood behin
d the officers.
 Prince Andrew l
ay on his chest 
with his face in
" the grass,
bre"
athing heavily a
nd noisily.  �
��What are you w
aiting for? Come
 along!”  Th
e peasants went 
up and took him 
by his shoulders
" and legs, but h"
e moaned piteou
"sly and, exchang"
"ing looks, they "
set him down aga
in.  “Pick h
"im up, lift him,"
 it’s all the 
same!” cried s
omeone.  They 
again took him b
y the shoulders 
and laid him on 
the stretcher. 
"
“Ah, God! My"
 God! What is it
? The stomach? T
hat means death!
 My God!”—v
oices among the 
officers were he
ard saying.  �
��It flew a hair
’s breadth pas
"t my ear,” sai"
d the adjutant. 
"

The peasants,"
 adjusting the s
tretcher to thei
"r shoulders, sta"
rted hurriedly 
along the path t
hey had trodden 
"down, to the dre"
ssing station. 
 “Keep in ste
p! Ah... those p
easants!” shou
"ted an officer, "
seizing by thei
r shoulders and 
checking the pea
"sants, who were "
walking unevenly
 and jolting th
e stretcher.  
“Get into step
", Fëdor... I sa"
"y, Fëdor!” sa"
id the foremost 
peasant.  “N
ow that’s righ
t!” said the o
ne behind joyful
"ly, when he had "
got into step. 
  “Your excel
"lency! Eh, Princ"
e!” said the t
rembling voice o
"f Timókhin, who"
 had run up and
 was looking dow
n on the stretch
er.  Prince An
drew opened his 
eyes and looked 
up at the speake
r from the stre
tcher into which
 his head had su
nk deep and agai
n his eyelids d
rooped.   The
 militiamen carr
ied Prince Andre
w to the dressin
g station by the
"
wood, where wa"
gons were statio
ned. The dressin
g station consis
ted of three te
nts with flaps t
"urned back, pitc"
hed at the edge 
of a birch wood.
"
In the wood, w"
agons and horses
 were standing. 
The horses were 
eating oats fro
m their movable 
troughs and spar
rows flew down a
nd pecked the g
rains that fell.
" Some crows, sce"
"nting blood, fle"
w among the birc
h trees cawing 
impatiently. Aro
"und the tents, o"
ver more than fi
"ve acres,
blood"
stained men in v
arious garbs sto
"od, sat, or lay."
 Around the woun
ded stood crowd
s of soldier str
etcher-bearers w
ith dismal and a
"ttentive
faces,"
 whom the office
rs keeping order
 tried in vain t
o drive from the
 spot. Disregar
ding the officer
"s’ orders, the"
 soldiers stood 
leaning against
 their stretcher
s and gazing int
"ently, as if try"
ing to comprehen
d the difficult
 problem of what
 was taking plac
e before them. F
rom the tents c
ame now loud ang
ry cries and now
 plaintive groan
s. Occasionally 
 dressers ran ou
t to fetch water
", or to point ou"
t those who were
 to be brought 
in next. The wou
nded men awaitin
g their turn out
side the tents 
"groaned, sighed,"
" wept, screamed,"
" swore, or asked"
 for vodka. Some
 were delirious
. Prince Andrew�
"��s bearers, ste"
pping over the w
ounded who had 
not yet been ban
"daged, took him,"
 as a regimental
" commander, clos"
e up to one of 
the tents and th
"ere stopped, awa"
iting instructio
ns. Prince Andre
w opened his ey
es and for a lon
g time could not
 make out what w
as going on aro
und him. He reme
mbered the meado
"w, the wormwood,"
" the field, the"
 whirling black 
"ball, and his su"
dden rush of pas
sionate love of 
life. Two steps
" from him, leani"
ng against a bra
nch and talking 
loudly and attr
acting general a
"ttention, stood "
"a tall, handsome"
", black-haired
"
noncommissioned 
officer with a b
andaged head. He
 had been wounde
d in the head a
nd leg by bullet
"s. Around him, e"
agerly listening
" to his talk, a"
 crowd of wounde
d and stretcher-
bearers was gath
ered.  “We k
icked him out fr
om there so that
 he chucked ever
"ything, we grabb"
ed the King him
self!” cried h
"e, looking aroun"
d him with eyes 
that glittered 
with fever. “I
f only reserves 
had come up just
" then, lads, the"
re wouldn’t h
ave been nothing
 left of him! I 
tell you surely.
...”  Like a
ll the others ne
"ar the speaker, "
Prince Andrew lo
oked at him with
 shining eyes a
nd experienced a
 sense of comfor
t. “But isn’
t it all the sa
me now?” thoug
ht he. “And wh
at will be there
", and what has t"
here been here?
 Why was I so re
luctant to part 
with life? There
 was something i
n this life I d
id not and do no
t understand.”
      CHAP
TER XXXVII  On
e of the doctors
 came out of the
 tent in a blood
"stained apron,
"
holding a cigar 
between the thum
b and little fin
ger of one of hi
s small bloodst
"ained hands, so "
as not to smear 
it. He raised hi
s head and looke
"d
about him, bu"
t above the leve
l of the wounded
 men. He evident
ly wanted a lit
tle respite. Aft
er turning his h
ead from right t
o left for some 
"time,
he sighed"
 and looked down
.  “All righ
"t, immediately,�"
�� he replied to
 a dresser who p
ointed Prince A
ndrew out to him
", and he told th"
em to carry him 
into the tent. 
 Murmurs arose 
among the wounde
d who were waiti
ng.  “It see
ms that even in 
the next world o
nly the gentry a
re to have a ch
ance!” remarke
d one.  Prince
 Andrew was carr
ied in and laid 
on a table that 
had only just be
en cleared and 
which a dresser 
was washing down
. Prince Andrew 
could not make 
out distinctly w
hat was in that 
tent. The pitifu
l groans from al
l sides and the
 torturing pain 
"in his thigh, st"
"omach, and back "
distracted him.
 All he saw abou
t him merged int
o a general impr
"ession of naked,"
 bleeding human
 bodies that see
med to fill the 
whole of the low
" tent, as
a few"
 weeks previousl
"y, on that hot A"
"ugust day, such "
bodies had fille
d the dirty pon
d beside the Smo
lénsk road. Yes
", it was the sam"
"e flesh,
the sa"
me chair à cano
"n, the sight of "
which had even t
hen filled him w
"ith
horror, as "
by a presentimen
t.  There were
 three operating
 tables in the t
ent. Two were oc
"cupied, and
on "
the third they p
laced Prince And
rew. For a littl
e while he was l
eft alone and i
nvoluntarily wit
nessed what was 
taking place on 
the other two t
ables. On the ne
arest one sat a 
"Tartar, probably"
" a Cossack, judg"
ing by the unif
orm thrown down 
beside him. Four
 soldiers were h
"olding him, and"
 a spectacled do
ctor was cutting
 into his muscul
ar brown back. 
"
“Ooh, ooh, o"
oh!” grunted t
"he Tartar, and s"
uddenly lifting 
up his swarthy 
snub-nosed face 
with its high ch
"eekbones, and ba"
ring his white t
"eeth,
he began "
to wriggle and t
witch his body a
nd utter piercin
"g, ringing,
and"
 prolonged yells
. On the other t
"able, round whic"
h many people we
"re
crowding, a "
tall well-fed ma
n lay on his bac
k with his head 
thrown back. Hi
"s curly hair, it"
"s color, and the"
 shape of his he
ad seemed strang
ely familiar to
 Prince Andrew. 
Several dressers
 were pressing o
n his chest to 
hold him down. O
"ne large, white,"
 plump leg twitc
hed rapidly all 
 the time with a
 feverish tremor
. The man was so
bbing and chokin
g convulsively.
 Two doctors—o
ne of whom was p
ale and tremblin
g—were silent
ly doing somethi
ng to this man�
"�s other, gory l"
eg. When he had 
 finished with t
"he Tartar, whom "
they covered wit
"h an overcoat, t"
he spectacled d
octor came up to
" Prince Andrew, "
wiping his hands
.  He glanced 
at Prince Andrew
’s face and qu
ickly turned awa
y.  “Undress
 him! What are y
ou waiting for?�
�� he cried angr
ily to the dres
sers.  His ver
"y first, remotes"
t recollections 
of childhood cam
e back to Prince
 Andrew’s min
d when the dress
er with sleeves 
rolled up began 
hastily to undo
 the buttons of 
his clothes and 
undressed him. T
he doctor bent 
down over the wo
"und, felt it, an"
d sighed deeply.
 Then he made a 
sign to someone
", and the tortur"
ing pain in his 
abdomen caused P
rince Andrew to 
 lose consciousn
ess. When he cam
e to himself the
 splintered port
ions of his thi
ghbone had been 
"extracted, the t"
orn flesh cut aw
"ay, and the
wou"
nd bandaged. Wat
er was being spr
inkled on his fa
ce. As soon as P
rince Andrew op
"ened his eyes, t"
he doctor bent o
"ver, kissed him "
silently on the 
"
lips, and hurri"
ed away.  Afte
r the sufferings
 he had been end
"uring, Prince An"
drew enjoyed a 
blissful feeling
 such as he had 
not experienced 
for a long time.
 All the best a
nd happiest mome
nts of his life�
��especially his
 earliest childh
"ood,
when he us"
ed to be undress
ed and put to be
"d, and when lean"
ing over him hi
s nurse sang him
 to sleep and he
", burying his he"
ad in the pillow
",
felt happy in"
 the mere consci
ousness of life�
��returned to hi
"s memory, not
m"
erely as somethi
ng past but as s
omething present
.  The doctors
 were busily eng
aged with the wo
unded man the sh
ape of whose he
ad seemed famili
ar to Prince And
rew: they were l
ifting him up an
d trying to qui
et him.  “Sh
ow it to me.... 
"Oh, ooh... Oh! O"
"h, ooh!” his f"
rightened moans 
"could
be heard,"
 subdued by suff
ering and broken
 by sobs.  Hea
ring those moans
 Prince Andrew w
anted to weep. W
hether because h
e was dying wit
"hout glory, or b"
ecause he was so
rry to part with
" life,
or becau"
se of those memo
ries of a childh
ood that could n
"ot return, or
b"
ecause he was su
ffering and othe
rs were sufferin
g and that man n
ear him was gro
aning so piteous
ly—he felt lik
e weeping childl
"ike, kindly, and"
 almost happy t
ears.  The wou
nded man was sho
wn his amputated
 leg stained wit
h clotted blood 
 and with the bo
ot still on.  
"“Oh! Oh, ooh!�"
"�� he sobbed, li"
ke a woman.  T
he doctor who ha
d been standing 
"beside him, prev"
enting Prince An
drew from seein
"g his face, move"
d away.  “My
 God! What is th
is? Why is he he
re?” said Prin
ce Andrew to him
self.  In the 
"miserable, sobbi"
"ng, enfeebled ma"
n whose leg had 
just been amput
"ated, he recogni"
zed Anatole Kur�
�gin. Men were s
upporting him in
 their arms and
 offering him a 
"glass of water, "
but his tremblin
"g, swollen
lips"
 could not grasp
 its rim. Anatol
e was sobbing pa
"infully. “Yes,"
" it is
he! Yes,"
 that man is som
ehow closely and
 painfully conne
"cted with me,”"
 thought Prince
" Andrew, not yet"
 clearly graspin
g what he saw be
fore him. “Wh
at is the connec
tion of that man
 with my childho
od and life?” 
he asked himsel
f without findin
g an answer. And
 suddenly a new 
unexpected memo
ry from that rea
lm of pure and l
oving childhood 
presented itself
 to him. He rem
embered Natásha
 as he had seen 
her for the firs
t time at the b
"all in 1810, wit"
h her slender ne
ck and arms and 
with a frightene
d happy face re
"ady for rapture,"
 and love and te
nderness for her
", stronger
and "
more vivid than 
"ever, awoke in h"
is soul. He now 
remembered the 
connection that 
existed between 
himself and this
 man who was dim
ly gazing at hi
m through tears 
that filled his 
swollen eyes. He
 remembered eve
"rything, and ecs"
tatic pity and l

  CHAPTER XXXV
III  The terri
ble spectacle of
 the battlefield
 covered with de
"ad and wounded,"
 together with t
he heaviness of 
his head and the
 news that some 
twenty generals
 he knew persona
lly had been kil
"led or wounded, "
and the conscio
usness of the im
potence of his o
"nce mighty arm, "
produced an une
xpected impressi
on on Napoleon w
ho usually liked
 to look at the 
 killed and woun
"ded, thereby, he"
" considered, tes"
ting his strengt
h of mind. This
 day the horribl
e appearance of 
the battlefield 
overcame that s
trength of mind 
which he thought
 constituted his
 merit and his 
greatness. He ro
de hurriedly fro
m the battlefiel
d and returned t
o the Shevárdi
"no knoll, where "
he sat on his ca
"mpstool, his sal"
low face swolle
"n and heavy, his"
" eyes dim, his n"
"ose red, and his"
" voice hoarse,
"
involuntarily li
"stening, with do"
"wncast eyes, to "
the sounds of fi
ring. With pain
ful dejection he
 awaited the end
" of this action,"
 in which he re
garded himself a
s a participant 
and which he was
 unable to arres
"t.
A personal, "
human feeling fo
r a brief moment
 got the better 
of the artifici
al phantasm of l
ife he had serve
d so long. He fe
lt in his own p
erson the suffer
ings and death h
e had witnessed 
on the battlefie
ld. The heavine
ss of his head a
nd chest reminde
d him of the pos
sibility of suf
fering and death
 for himself. At
 that moment he 
did not desire 
"Moscow, or victo"
"ry, or glory (wh"
at need had he f
or any more glor
y?). The one th
ing he wished fo
"r was rest, tran"
"quillity, and fr"
eedom. But when 
he had been on 
the Semënovsk h
eights the artil
lery commander h
ad proposed to 
him to bring sev
eral batteries o
f artillery up t
o those heights 
to strengthen t
he fire on the R
ussian troops cr
owded in front o
f Knyazkóvo. N
apoleon had asse
nted and had giv
en orders that n
ews should be br
ought to him of
 the effect thos
e batteries prod
uced.  An adju
tant came now to
 inform him that
 the fire of two
 hundred guns h
ad been concentr
ated on the Russ
"ians, as he had "
"ordered, but tha"
t they still he
ld their ground.
  “Our fire 
is mowing them d
"own by rows, but"
 still they hold
" on,” said the"
 adjutant.  �
��They want more
!...” said Nap
oleon in a hoars
e voice.  “S
ire?” asked th
e adjutant who h
ad not heard the
 remark.  “T
hey want more!�
� croaked Napole
on frowning. “
Let them have it
!”  Even bef
ore he gave that
 order the thing
 he did not desi
"re, and for
whi"
ch he gave the o
rder only becaus
e he thought it 
was expected of 
"him,
was being "
done. And he fel
l back into that
 artificial real
m of imaginary 
"greatness, and a"
gain—as a hors
e walking a trea
dmill thinks it 
is doing someth
ing for itself�
�he submissively
 fulfilled the c
"ruel, sad, gloom"
"y,
and inhuman "
role predestined
 for him.  And
 not for that da
y and hour alone
 were the mind a
nd conscience d
arkened of this 
man on whom the 
responsibility f
or what was happ
ening lay more 
than on all the 
others who took 
part in it. Neve
r to the end of
 his life could 
he understand go
"odness, beauty, "
"or truth, or the"
 significance o
f his actions wh
ich were too con
trary to goodnes
"s and
truth, to"
o remote from ev
"erything human, "
for him ever to 
be able to gras
p their meaning.
 He could not di
savow his action
"s, belauded as t"
hey were by hal
"f the world, and"
 so he had to re
"pudiate truth, g"
"oodness, and
al"
l humanity.  N
ot only on that 
"day, as he rode "
over the battlef
ield strewn with
 men killed and
 maimed (by his 
will as he belie
"ved), did he rec"
kon as he looke
d at them how ma
ny Russians ther
e were for each 
"Frenchman and,
"
deceiving himsel
"f, find reason f"
or rejoicing in 
the calculation 
that there were
 five Russians f
or every Frenchm
an. Not on that 
day alone did h
e write in a let
ter to Paris tha
t “the battle 
field was superb
",”
because fi"
fty thousand cor
"pses lay there, "
but even on the 
island of St. H
elena in the pea
ceful solitude w
here he said he 
intended to devo
te his leisure 
to an account of
 the great deeds
" he had done, he"
 wrote:  The R
ussian war shoul
d have been the 
most popular war
 of modern times
: it was a war 
"of good sense, f"

 was purely paci

a war for a grea

 of uncertaintie
s and the begin

. A new horizon 
and new labors w
"ere opening out,"
 full of well-b
eing and prosper

 European system
 was already fo
unded; all that 
remained was to 
organize it.  
Satisfied on the
se great points 
and with tranqui

 I too should h
ave had my Congr

ideas were stol

hat reunion of g

  On returning 
"to France, to th"

 so that by the

k the whole res

APTER XXXIX  S
everal tens of t
housands of the 
slain lay in div
erse postures an
d various unifo
rms on the field
s and meadows be
longing to the D
avýdov family 
and to the crown
 serfs—those f
ields and meadow
s where for hun
dreds of years t
he peasants of B
"orodinó, Górki"
", Shevárdino, a"
nd Semënovsk h
ad reaped their 
harvests and pas
tured their catt
le. At the dres
sing stations th
e grass and eart
h were soaked wi
th blood for a s
pace of some th
ree acres around
. Crowds of men 
"of various arms,"
 wounded and un
"wounded, with fr"
"ightened faces, "
dragged themselv
es back to Mozh�
�ysk from the o
ne army and back
 to Valúevo fro
m the other. Oth
"er crowds,
exha"
usted and hungry
", went forward l"
ed by their offi
cers. Others hel
d their ground 
and continued to
 fire.  Over t
"he whole field, "
previously so ga
ily beautiful wi
th the glitter o
f bayonets and 
cloudlets of smo
ke in the mornin
"g sun, there now"
 spread a mist 
of damp and smok
e and a strange 
acid smell of sa
ltpeter and bloo
d. Clouds gathe
red and drops of
 rain began to f
all on the dead 
"and wounded,
on"
" the frightened,"
" exhausted, and "
"hesitating men, "
as if to say: �
"�Enough,
men! E"
nough! Cease... 
bethink yourselv
es! What are you
 doing?”  To
 the men of both
" sides alike, wo"
rn out by want o
"f food and rest,"
 it began equal
ly to appear dou
btful whether th
ey should contin
ue to slaughter
 one another; al
l the faces expr
essed hesitation
", and the
quest"
ion arose in eve
ry soul: “For 
"what, for whom, "
must I kill and 
be killed?... Y
ou may go and ki
ll whom you plea
"se, but I don’"
t want to do so
 any more!” By
 evening this th
ought had ripene
d in every soul.
 At any moment 
these men might 
have been seized
 with horror at 
what they were 
doing and might 
have thrown up e
verything and ru
n away anywhere.
  But though t
oward the end of
 the battle the 
men felt all the
 horror of what
 they were doing
", though they wo"
uld have been gl
"ad to leave off,"
 some incompreh
"ensible, mysteri"
ous power contin
ued to control t
"hem, and
they s"
till brought up 
"the charges, loa"
"ded, aimed, and "
applied the matc
"h,
though only "
one artilleryman
 survived out of
" every three, an"
d though they s
tumbled and pant
"ed with fatigue,"
 perspiring and 
stained with blo
od and powder. 
The cannon balls
 flew just as sw
iftly and cruell
y from both sid
"es, crushing hum"
"an bodies, and t"
hat terrible wor
k which was not 
done by the wil
l of a man but a
t the will of Hi
m who governs me
n and worlds co
ntinued.  Anyo
ne looking at th
e disorganized r
ear of the Russi
an army would ha
"ve
said that, i"
f only the Frenc
h made one more 
"slight effort, i"
t would disappe
ar; and anyone l
ooking at the re
ar of the French
 army would have
 said that the 
Russians need on
ly make one more
 slight effort a
nd the French w
ould be destroye
d. But neither t
he French nor th
e Russians made 
"
that effort, an"
d the flame of b
attle burned slo
wly out.  The 
Russians did not
 make that effor
t because they w
ere not attackin
g the French. A
t the beginning 
of the battle th
ey stood blockin
g the way to Mo
scow and they st
ill did so at th
e end of the bat
tle as at the b
eginning. But ev
en had the aim o
f the Russians b
een to drive the
 French from th
"eir positions, t"
hey could not ha
ve made this las
"t effort, for al"
l the Russian t
roops had been b
"roken up, there "
was no part of t
he Russian army
 that had not su
ffered in the ba
"ttle, and though"
 still holding t
heir positions 
they had lost ON
E HALF of their 
army.  The Fre
"nch, with the me"
mory of all thei
r former victori
es during fifte
"en years, with t"
he assurance of 
Napoleon’s inv
"incibility, with"
 the consciousn
ess that they ha
d captured part 
of the battlefie
ld and had lost
 only a quarter 
of their men and
 still had their
" Guards intact,"
 twenty thousand
" strong, might e"
asily have made 
that effort. The
 French who had
 attacked the Ru
ssian army in or
der to drive it 
from its positio
n ought to have
 made that effor
"t, for as long a"
s the Russians c
ontinued to blo
ck the road to M
"oscow as before,"
 the aim of the 
French had not b
een attained an
d all their effo
rts and losses w
ere in vain. But
 the French did
 not make that e
ffort. Some hist
orians say that 
Napoleon need on
ly have used hi
"s Old Guards, wh"
"o were intact, a"
nd the battle wo
uld have been w
on. To speak of 
what would have 
happened had Nap
oleon sent his 
Guards is like t
alking of what w
ould happen if a
utumn became spr
ing. It could n
ot be. Napoleon 
did not give his
" Guards, not bec"
ause he did not 
"
want to, but be"
cause it could n
ot be done. All 
"the generals, of"
"ficers,
and sol"
diers of the Fre
nch army knew it
 could not be do
"ne, because the"
 flagging spirit
 of the troops w
ould not permit 
it.  It was no
t Napoleon alone
 who had experie
nced that nightm
are feeling of 
the mighty arm b
eing stricken po
"werless, but all"
 the generals an
d soldiers of h
is army whether 
they had taken p
art in the battl
"e or not,
after"
 all their exper
ience of previou
s battles—when
 after one tenth
 of such effort
s the enemy had 
fled—experienc
ed a similar fee
ling of terror 
before an enemy 
"who, after losin"
"g HALF his men, "
stood as threate
ningly at the e
nd as at the beg
inning of the ba
ttle. The moral 
force of the at
tacking French a
rmy was exhauste
d. Not that sort
 of victory whic
h is defined by
 the capture of 
pieces of materi
al fastened to s
"ticks, called
s"
"tandards, and of"
 the ground on w
hich the troops 
had stood and we
"re
standing, bu"
t a moral victor
y that convinces
 the enemy of th
e moral superio
rity of his oppo
nent and of his 
own impotence wa
s gained by the 
 Russians at Bor
odinó. The Fren
"ch invaders, lik"
e an infuriated 
animal that has
 in its onslaugh
t received a mor
"tal wound, felt "
that they were 
"perishing, but c"
"ould not stop, a"
ny more than the
" Russian army, w"
eaker by one ha
"lf, could help s"
werving. By impe
"tus gained, the "
French army was 
 still able to r
oll forward to M
"oscow, but there"
", without furthe"
r effort on the
 part of the Rus
"sians, it had to"
" perish, bleedin"
g from the morta
l wound it had 
received at Boro
dinó. The direc
t consequence of
 the battle of 
Borodinó was Na
poleon’s sense
less flight from
" Moscow, his ret"
reat along the 
old Smolénsk ro
"ad, the destruct"

      CHAP
TER I  Absolut
e continuity of 
motion is not co
mprehensible to 
the human mind. 
 Laws of motion 
of any kind beco
me comprehensibl
e to man only wh
en he examines 
arbitrarily sele
cted elements of
 that motion; bu
t at the same t
"ime, a large pro"
portion of human
 error comes fro
m the arbitrary 
 division of con
tinuous motion i
nto discontinuou
s elements. Ther
e is a well-kno
"wn, so-called so"
phism of the anc
ients consisting
" in this, that
"
Achilles could n
ever catch up wi
th a tortoise he
" was following, "
in spite of the
 fact that he tr
aveled ten times
 as fast as the 
tortoise. By th
e time Achilles 
has covered the 
distance that se
parated him from
" the
tortoise, "
the tortoise has
 covered one ten
th of that dista
nce ahead of hi
m: when Achilles
 has covered tha
"t tenth, the tor"
toise has covere
d another one h
"undredth, and so"
 on forever. Thi
s problem seemed
 to the ancient
s insoluble. The
 absurd answer (
that Achilles co
uld never overt
ake the tortoise
) resulted from 
this: that motio
n was arbitraril
y divided into 
discontinuous el
"ements, whereas "
the motion both 
of Achilles and
 of the tortoise
 was continuous.
  By adopting 
smaller and smal
ler elements of 
motion we only a
pproach a solut
ion of the probl
"em, but never re"
ach it. Only whe
n we have admitt
ed the concepti
on of the infini
"tely small, and "
the resulting ge
ometrical progr
ession with a co
mmon ratio of on
"e tenth, and hav"
e found the sum 
of this progres
sion to infinity
", do we reach a "
solution of the 
problem.  A mo
dern branch of m
athematics havin
g achieved the a
rt of dealing wi
th the infinite
ly small can now
 yield solutions
 in other more c
omplex problems
 of motion which
 used to appear 
insoluble.  Th
is modern branch
" of mathematics,"
 unknown to the 
"ancients, when d"
ealing with pro
blems of motion 
admits the conce
ption of the inf
"initely small,
"
and so conforms 
to the chief con
dition of motion
 (absolute conti
nuity) and ther
eby corrects the
 inevitable erro
r which the huma
n mind cannot a
void when it dea
ls with separate
 elements of mot
ion instead of 
examining contin
uous motion.  
In seeking the l
aws of historica
l movement just 
the same thing h
appens. The mov
ement of humanit
"y, arising as it"
 does from innum
erable arbitrary
"
human wills, i"
s continuous.  
 To understand t
he laws of this 
continuous movem
ent is the aim o
f history. But 
to arrive at the
"se laws, resulti"
ng from the sum 
of all those hu
"man wills, man�"
�s mind postulat
es arbitrary and
 disconnected u
nits. The first 
method of histor
y is to take an 
arbitrarily sele
cted series of 
continuous event
s and examine it
 apart from othe
"rs, though
ther"
e is and can be 
no beginning to 
"any event, for o"
ne event always 
 flows uninterru
ptedly from anot
her.  The seco
nd method is to 
consider the act
ions of some one
 man—a king or
 a commander—
as equivalent to
 the sum of many
 individual will
s; whereas the 
sum of individua
l wills is never
 expressed by th
e activity of a 
single historic
 personage.  H
istorical scienc
e in its endeavo
r to draw nearer
 to truth contin
ually takes sma
ller and smaller
 units for exami
nation. But howe
ver small the u
"nits it takes, w"
e feel that to t
ake any unit dis
connected from o
"thers,
or to as"
sume a beginning
 of any phenomen
"on, or to say th"
at the will of 
many men is expr
essed by the act
ions of any one 
historic persona
"ge, is
in itsel"
f false.  It n
eeds no critical
 exertion to red
uce utterly to d
ust any deductio
ns drawn from h
istory. It is me
rely necessary t
o select some la
rger or smaller
 unit as the sub
ject of observat
ion—as critici
sm has every ri
"ght to do, seein"
g that whatever 
unit history obs
erves must alway
s be arbitraril
y selected.  O
nly by taking in
finitesimally sm
all units for ob
servation (the 
differential of 
"history, that is"
", the individual"
 tendencies of m
en) and attaini
ng to the art of
 integrating the
"m (that is, find"
ing the sum of 
these infinitesi
mals) can we hop
e to arrive at t
he laws of histo
ry.  The first
 fifteen years o
f the nineteenth
 century in Euro
pe present an e
xtraordinary mov
ement of million
s of people. Men
 leave their cus
tomary pursuits
", hasten from on"
e side of Europe
" to the other, p"
lunder and slau
ghter one anothe
"r, triumph and a"
re plunged in de
"spair, and for s"
ome years the w
hole course of l
ife is altered a
nd presents an i
ntensive moveme
nt which first i
ncreases and the
n slackens. What
 was the cause o
f this movement
", by what laws w"
as it governed? 
asks the mind of
 man.  The his
"torians, replyin"
g to this questi
"on, lay before u"
s the sayings an
d doings of a f
ew dozen men in 
a building in th
"e city of Paris,"
 calling these 
sayings and doin
gs “the Revolu
tion”; then th
ey give a detail
ed biography of
 Napoleon and of
 certain people 
favorable or hos
tile to him; te
ll of the influe
nce some of thes
e people had on 
"others, and say:"
 that is why th
is movement took
 place and those
 are its laws. 
 But the mind o
f man not only r
efuses to believ
e this explanati
"on, but
plainly"
 says that this 
method of explan
ation is fallaci
"ous, because in"
 it a weaker phe
nomenon is taken
 as the cause of
 a stronger. The
 sum of human w
ills produced th
e Revolution and
" Napoleon, and o"
nly the sum of 
those wills firs
t tolerated and 
then destroyed t
hem.  “But e

een conquerors; 
 every time ther
e has been a rev
olution in any s
tate there have 
"been
great men,"
” says history
". And, indeed, h"
uman reason repl
ies: every time 
 conquerors appe
ar there have be
"en wars, but thi"
s does not prove
 that the conqu
erors caused the
 wars and that i
t is possible to
 find the laws o
f a war in the 
personal activit
y of a single ma
n. Whenever I lo
ok at my watch 
and its hands po
"int to ten, I he"
ar the bells of 
the neighboring 
 church; but bec
ause the bells b
egin to ring whe
n the hands of t
he clock reach 
"ten, I have no r"
ight to assume t
hat the movement
 of the bells is
 caused by the 
position of the 
hands of the wat
ch.  Whenever 
I see the moveme
nt of a locomoti
ve I hear the wh
istle and see t
he valves openin
g and wheels tur
ning; but I have
 no right to con
clude that the 
whistling and th
e turning of whe
els are the caus
e of the moveme
nt of the engine
.  The peasant
s say that a col
d wind blows in 
late spring beca
use the oaks ar
"e budding, and r"
eally every spri
ng cold winds do
 blow when the o
ak is budding. 
But though I do 
not know what ca
uses the cold wi
nds to blow whe
n the oak buds u
"nfold, I cannot "
agree with the p
easants that the
 unfolding of t
he oak buds is t
he cause of the 
"cold wind, for t"
he force of the
 wind is beyond 
the influence of
 the buds. I see
 only a coincid
ence of occurren
ces such as happ
ens with all the
 phenomena of l
"ife, and I see t"
hat however much
 and however car
efully I observe
 the hands of t
"he watch, and th"
e valves and whe
els of the engin
"e, and the
oak,"
 I shall not dis
cover the cause 
of the bells rin
"ging, the engine"
"
moving, or of "
the winds of spr
ing. To that I m
ust entirely cha
nge my point of
 view and study 
the laws of the 
movement of stea
"m, of the
bells"
", and of the win"
d. History must 
do the same. And
 attempts in thi
s direction hav
e already been m
ade.  To study
 the laws of his
tory we must com
pletely change t
he subject of o
"ur observation, "
must leave aside
" kings, minister"
"s, and generals,"
 and study the 
"common, infinite"
simally small el
ements by which 
the masses are 
moved. No one ca
n say in how far
 it is possible 
for man to advan
ce in this way 
toward an unders
tanding of the l
aws of history; 
but it is evide
nt that only alo
ng that path doe
s the possibilit
y of discovering
 the laws of hi
"story lie, and t"
hat as yet not a
 millionth part 
as much mental 
effort has been 
applied in this 
direction by his
torians as has 
been devoted to 
describing the a
ctions of variou

      CHAP
TER II  The fo
rces of a dozen 
European nations
 burst into Russ
ia. The Russian 
 army and people
 avoided a colli
sion till Smolé
"nsk was reached,"
 and again from
 Smolénsk to Bo
rodinó. The Fre
nch army pushed 
"on to Moscow, it"
"s
goal, its imp"
etus ever increa
sing as it neare
"d its aim, just "
as the velocity
 of a falling bo
dy increases as 
it approaches th
e earth. Behind 
 it were seven h
undred miles of 
"hunger-stricken,"
 hostile country
; ahead were a 
few dozen miles 
separating it fr
om its goal. Eve
ry soldier in N
apoleon’s army
 felt this and t
he invasion move
d on by its own 
momentum.  The
 more the Russia
n army retreated
 the more fierce
ly a spirit of h
atred of the en
"emy flared up, a"
nd while it retr
eated the army i
ncreased and co
nsolidated. At B
orodinó a colli
sion took place.
 Neither army wa
"s
broken up, bu"
t the Russian ar
my retreated imm
ediately after t
he collision as
 inevitably as a
 ball recoils af
ter colliding wi
th another havi
ng a greater mom
"entum, and with "
equal inevitabil
ity the ball of
 invasion that h
ad advanced with
 such momentum r
olled on for som
"e
distance, tho"
ugh the collisio
n had deprived i
t of all its for
ce.  The Russi
ans retreated ei
ghty miles—to 
beyond Moscow—
and the French 
reached Moscow a
nd there came to
 a standstill. F
or five weeks af
ter that there 
was not a single
 battle. The Fre
nch did not move
". As a bleeding,"
 mortally wound
ed animal licks 
"its wounds, they"
 remained inert 
in Moscow for f
"ive weeks, and t"
"hen suddenly, wi"
th no fresh reas
"on, fled back:
"
they made a dash
 for the Kalúga
" road, and (afte"
r a victory—fo
r at Málo-Yaro
slávets the fie
ld of conflict a
gain remained th
eirs) without u
ndertaking a sin
gle serious batt
"le, they fled st"
ill more rapidly
 back to Smolé
"nsk, beyond Smol"
"énsk, beyond th"
"e Berëzina, bey"
"ond Vílna, and"
 farther still. 
  On the evenin
g of the twenty-
"sixth of August,"
 Kutúzov and th
e whole Russian
 army were convi
nced that the ba
ttle of Borodin�
� was a victory.
 Kutúzov repor
ted so to the Em
peror. He gave o
rders to prepare
 for a fresh co
nflict to finish
 the enemy and d
id this not to d
"eceive anyone,
"
but because he k
new that the ene
"my was beaten, a"
s everyone who h
ad taken part i
n the battle kne
w it.  But all
 that evening an
d next day repor
ts came in one a
fter another of
 unheard-of loss
"es, of the loss "
of half the army
", and a fresh ba"
ttle proved phy
sically impossib
le.  It was im
possible to give
 battle before i
nformation had b
"een collected,
"
the wounded gath
"ered in, the sup"
plies of ammunit
"ion replenished,"
 the slain reck
"oned up, new off"
icers appointed 
to replace those
 who had been k
"illed, and befor"
e the men had ha
d food and sleep
". And meanwhile,"
 the very next 
morning after th
"e battle, the Fr"
ench army advanc
ed of itself up
"on the Russians,"
 carried forward
 by the force of
 its own momentu
m now seemingly
 increased in in
verse proportion
 to the square o
f the distance 
from its aim. Ku
túzov’s wish 
was to attack ne
"xt day, and the "
whole army desi
red to do so. Bu
t to make an att
ack the wish to 
do so is not su
"fficient, there "
must also be a p
ossibility of do
"ing it, and that"
 possibility di
d not exist. It 
was impossible n
ot to retreat a 
"day’s
march, "
and then in the 
same way it was 
impossible not t
o retreat anothe
r and a third d
"ay’s march, an"
"d at last, on th"
e first of Septe
mber when the a
rmy drew near Mo
scow—despite t
he strength of t
he feeling that 
had arisen in a
ll ranks—the f
orce of circumst
ances compelled 
it to retire be
yond Moscow. And
 the troops reti
"red one more, la"
"st, day’s marc"
"h, and
abandone"
d Moscow to the 
enemy.  For pe
ople accustomed 
to think that pl
ans of campaign 
and battles are 
 made by general
s—as anyone of
 us sitting over
 a map in his st
udy may imagine
 how he would ha
ve arranged thin
gs in this or th
at battle—the 
 questions prese
nt themselves: W
hy did Kutúzov 
during the retre
at not do this 
or that? Why did
 he not take up 
a position befor
e reaching Filí
? Why did he no
t retire at once
 by the Kalúga 
"road, abandoning"
 Moscow? and so
 on. People accu
stomed to think 
in that way forg
"et, or do not kn"
"ow,
the inevita"
ble conditions w
hich always limi
t the activities
 of any command
er in chief. The
 activity of a c
ommander in chie
f does not at al
l resemble the 
activity we imag
ine to ourselves
 when we sit at 
ease in our stu
dies examining s
ome campaign on 
"the map, with a "
certain number o
f troops on thi
s and that side 
in a certain kno
"wn locality, and"
 begin our plan
s from some give
n moment. A comm
ander in chief i
s never dealing 
with the beginn
ing of any event
—the position 
from which we al
ways contemplate
 it. The comman
der in chief is 
always in the mi
dst of a series 
of shifting eve
nts and so he ne
ver can at any m
oment consider t
he whole import
 of an event tha
t is occurring. 
Moment by moment
 the event is i
mperceptibly sha
"ping itself, and"
 at every moment
 of this continu
"ous,
uninterrup"
ted shaping of e
vents the comman
der in chief is 
in the midst of
 a most complex 
play of intrigue
"s, worries, cont"
"ingencies,
auth"
"orities, project"
"s, counsels, thr"
"eats, and decept"
ions and is con
tinually obliged
 to reply to inn
umerable questio
ns addressed to 
"him,
which cons"
tantly conflict 
with one another
.  Learned mil
itary authoritie
s quite seriousl
y tell us that K
utúzov should 
have moved his a
rmy to the Kalú
ga road long bef
ore reaching Fil
"í, and
that so"
mebody actually 
submitted such a
 proposal to him
. But a commande
"r
in chief, esp"
ecially at a dif
"ficult moment, h"
as always before
 him not one pr
oposal but dozen
s simultaneously
. And all these 
"proposals, based"
 on strategics 
"and tactics, con"
tradict each oth
er.  A command
er in chief’s 
"business, it wou"
"ld seem, is simp"
ly to choose one
 of these proje
cts. But even th
at he cannot do.
 Events and time
 do not wait. F
"or instance, on "
the twenty-eight
h it is suggeste
d to him to cro
ss to the Kalúg
"a road, but just"
 then an adjutan
t gallops up fro
m Milorádovich
 asking whether 
he is to engage 
the French or re
tire. An order 
must be given hi
"m at once, that "
instant. And the
 order to retrea
t carries us pa
st the turn to t
he Kalúga road.
 And after the a
djutant comes t
he commissary ge
neral asking whe
re the stores ar
"e to be taken,
"
and the chief of
 the hospitals a
sks where the wo
"unded are to go,"
 and a courier 
from Petersburg 
brings a letter 
from the soverei
gn which does n
ot admit of the 
possibility of a
bandoning Moscow
", and the comman"
der in chief’
"s rival, the man"
 who is undermin
ing him (and the
re are always n
ot merely one bu
"t several such),"
 presents a new 
project diametri
cally opposed t
o that of turnin
g to the Kalúga
" road, and the c"
ommander in chi
ef himself needs
 sleep and refre
shment to mainta
in his energy an
d a respectable
 general who has
 been overlooked
 in the distribu
tion of rewards
 comes to compla
"in, and the inha"
bitants of the d
istrict pray to 
"
be defended, an"
d an officer sen
t to inspect the
 locality comes 
in and gives a 
report quite con
trary to what wa
s said by the of
ficer previousl
y sent; and a sp
"y, a prisoner, a"
nd a general who
 has been on re
"connaissance, al"
l describe the p
osition of the e
nemy’s army d
ifferently. Peop
le accustomed to
 misunderstand o
r to forget thes
e inevitable co
nditions of a co
mmander in chief
’s actions des
"cribe to
us, fo"
"r instance, the "
position of the 
army at Filí an
d assume that th
e commander in 
"chief could, on "
the first of Sep
"tember, quite fr"
eely decide whe
ther to abandon 
Moscow or defend
" it; whereas, wi"
th the Russian a
rmy less than f
our miles from M
"oscow, no such q"
uestion existed.
 When had that 
question been se
ttled? At Drissa
 and at Smoléns
k and most palp
ably of all on t
he twenty-fourth
 of August at Sh
evárdino and on
 the twenty-six
"th at Borodinó,"
 and each day an
d hour and minut
e of the retrea
t from Borodinó
 to Filí.   
   CHAPTER II
I  When Ermól
"ov, having been "
sent by Kutúzov
 to inspect the 
"position, told
"
the field marsha
l that it was im
possible to figh
t there before M
oscow and that 
they must retrea
"t, Kutúzov look"
ed at him in sil
ence.  “Give
" me your hand,�"
"� said he and, t"
urning it over s
o as to feel the
"
pulse, added: "
“You are not w
"ell, my dear fel"
low. Think what 
you are saying!
”  Kutúzov 
could not yet ad
mit the possibil
ity of retreatin
g beyond Moscow 
 without a battl
e.  On the Pok
"lónny Hill, fou"
r miles from the
 Dorogomílov ga
"te of Moscow,
K"
utúzov got out 
of his carriage 
and sat down on 
a bench by the r
oadside. A grea
t crowd of gener
als gathered rou
"nd him, and Coun"
"t Rostopchín, w"
ho had come out
" from Moscow, jo"
ined them. This 
brilliant compan
y separated int
o several groups
 who all discuss
ed the advantage
s and disadvanta
ges of the posi
"tion, the state "
"of the army, the"
 plans suggested
", the
situation"
" of Moscow, and "
military questio
ns generally. Th
ough they had n
ot been summoned
 for the purpose
", and though it "
was not so calle
"d, they
all fel"
t that this was 
really a council
 of war. The con
versations all 
dealt with publi
c questions. If 
anyone gave or a
sked for persona
"l
news, it was "
done in a whispe
r and they immed
iately reverted 
to general matt
"ers. No jokes, o"
"r laughter, or s"
"miles even, were"
 seen among all 
 these men. They
 evidently all m
ade an effort to
 hold themselves
 at the height 
the situation de
manded. And all 
"these groups, wh"
ile talking amo
"ng themselves, t"
ried to keep nea
r the commander 
in chief (whose 
 bench formed th
e center of the 
gathering) and t
o speak so that 
he might overhe
ar them. The com
mander in chief 
listened to what
 was being said 
 and sometimes a
sked them to rep
eat their remark
"s, but did not h"
imself take par
t in the convers
ations or expres
s any opinion. A
fter hearing wh
at was being sai
d by one or othe
r of these group
s he generally t
urned away with
 an air of disap
"pointment, as th"
ough they were n
ot speaking of 
anything he wish
ed to hear. Some
 discussed the p
osition that had
" been
chosen, c"
riticizing not t
he position itse
lf so much as th
e mental capaci
ty of those who 
had chosen it. O
thers argued tha
t a mistake had 
 been made earli
er and that a ba
ttle should have
 been fought two
 days before. O
thers again spok
e of the battle 
"of Salamanca, wh"
ich was describ
"ed by Crosart, a"
 newly arrived F
renchman in a Sp
anish uniform. 
(This Frenchman 
and one of the G
erman princes se
rving with the R
ussian army wer
e discussing the
 siege of Sarago
ssa and consider
ing the possibi
lity of defendin
g Moscow in a si
milar manner.) C
ount Rostopchín
 was telling a 
fourth group tha
t he was prepare
d to die with th
e city train ba
nds under the wa
lls of the capit
"al, but that he "
still could not 
 help regretting
 having been lef
t in ignorance o
f what was happe
"ning, and
that "
had he known it 
sooner things wo
uld have been di
fferent.... A f
"ifth group, disp"
laying the profu
ndity of their s
trategic percept
"ions,
discussed"
 the direction t
he troops would 
now have to take
. A sixth group 
 was talking abs
olute nonsense. 
Kutúzov’s exp
ression grew mor
e and more preo
ccupied and gloo
my. From all thi
s talk he saw on
ly one thing: th
at to defend Mo
scow was a physi
cal impossibilit
y in the full me
aning of those 
"words, that is t"
"o say, so utterl"
y impossible tha
t if any sensele
ss commander we
re to give order
"s to fight, conf"
usion would resu
lt but the batt
le would still n
ot take place. I
t would not take
 place because t
he commanders n
ot merely all re
cognized the pos
ition to be impo
"ssible, but
in "
their conversati
ons were only di
scussing what wo
uld happen after
 its inevitable
 abandonment. Ho
w could the comm
anders lead thei
r troops to a f
ield of battle t
hey considered i
mpossible to hol
d? The lower-gra
de officers and
 even the soldie
rs (who too reas
on) also conside
red the positio
n impossible and
 therefore could
 not go to fight
", fully convince"
d as they were 
of defeat. If Be
nnigsen insisted
 on the position
 being defended
 and others stil
"l discussed it, "
the question was
 no longer impo
rtant in itself 
but only as a pr
etext for disput
es and intrigue.
 This Kutúzov 
knew well.  Be
"nnigsen, who had"
 chosen the posi
"tion, warmly dis"
played his Russi
an patriotism (
Kutúzov could n
ot listen to thi
s without wincin
g) by insisting
 that Moscow mus
t be defended. H
is aim was as cl
ear as daylight 
 to Kutúzov: if
 the defense fai
"led, to throw th"
e blame on Kutú
zov who had bro
ught the army as
 far as the Spar
row Hills withou
t giving battle;
 if it succeede
"d, to claim the "
success as his o
wn; or if battle
 were not given
", to clear himse"
lf of the crime 
of abandoning Mo
scow. But this 
intrigue did not
 now occupy the 
old man’s mind
. One terrible q
uestion absorbe
d him and to tha
t question he he
ard no reply fro
m anyone. The q
uestion for him 
now was: “Have
 I really allowe
d Napoleon to re
"ach
Moscow, and"
 when did I do s
o? When was it d
ecided? Can it h
ave been yester
day when I order
ed Plátov to re
"treat, or was it"
 the evening be
"fore, when I had"
 a nap and told 
Bennigsen to iss
ue orders? Or wa
s it earlier st
"ill?... When, wh"
en was this terr
ible affair deci
ded? Moscow mus
t be abandoned. 
The army must re
treat and the or
der to do so mus
t be given.” 
To give that ter
rible order seem
ed to him equiva
lent to resigni
ng the command o
f the army. And 
not only did he 
love power to w
hich he was accu
stomed (the hono
urs awarded to P
rince Prozoróvs
"ki,
under whom "
he had served in
" Turkey, galled "
"him), but he was"
 convinced that
 he was destined
 to save Russia 
and that that wa
"s why, against
"
the Emperor’s 
wish and by the 
will of the peop
"le, he had been "
chosen commande
r in chief. He w
as convinced tha
t he alone could
 maintain comma
nd of the army i
n these difficul
"t circumstances,"
 and that in all
 the world he a
lone could encou
nter the invinci
ble Napoleon wit
"hout fear,
and "
he was horrified
 at the thought 
of the order he 
had to issue. Bu
t something had
" to be decided, "
and these conver
sations around h
im which were a
ssuming too free
 a character mus
t be stopped.  
 He called the m
ost important ge
nerals to him. 
"
“My head, be"
" it good or bad,"
 must depend on 
"itself,” said "
"he, rising
from"
" the bench, and "
he rode to Filí
 where his carri
ages were waitin
g.      CH
APTER IV  The 
Council of War b
egan to assemble
 at two in the a
fternoon in the 
 better and room
ier part of Andr
ew Savostyánov�
��s hut. The men
", women, and
ch"
ildren of the la

ly crowded into 
the back room ac
ross the passag

", Andrew’s six"
-year-old grandd
aughter whom hi

s had petted and
 to whom he had 
given a lump of 
sugar while dri
"nking his tea, r"
emained on the t

ha looked down f
rom the oven wit
h shy delight at
" the

"forms, and decor"
ations of the ge
"nerals, who one "
after another c
ame into the roo
m and sat down o

"�� himself, as M"
alásha in her o
wn mind called 
"Kutúzov, sat ap"
art in a dark co
rner behind the 
"oven. He sat, su"
nk deep in a fo
"lding armchair, "
and continually 
cleared his thro
at and pulled at
 the collar of 
"his coat which, "
though it was un
"buttoned, still "
seemed to pinch
 his neck. Those
 who entered wen
t up one by one 
to the field ma
rshal; he presse
d the hands of s
ome and nodded t
o others. His ad
jutant Kaysáro

ow facing Kutú

ter moved his ha
nd angrily and K
aysárov underst
ood that his Se

d not wish his f

  Round the pea

"y maps, plans, p"

ple gathered tha
t the orderlies

t it beside the

" Kaysárov, and "
"Toll, who had

"most place, imme"
diately under t

his high forehea
d merging into 
his bald crown. 
He had a St. Geo
rge’s Cross ro
und his neck and
 looked pale an
d ill. He had be
en feverish for 
two days and was
 now shivering 
and in pain. Bes
ide him sat Uvá
"rov, who with ra"
pid gesticulatio
ns was giving h
im some informat
"ion, speaking in"
 low tones as th
ey all did. Chu
bby little Dokht

ing attentively 
with eyebrows r
aised and arms f
olded on his sto

 absorbed in his
 own thoughts. H
is broad head w

Raévski, tw"
itching forward 
the black hair o
n his temples as
" was his
habit,"
 glanced now at 
Kutúzov and now
 at the door wit

at had been pla
ced there to lig
ht up his face. 
  Bennigsen ope
ned the council 
with the questio
n: “Are we to 
abandon Russia�
��s ancient and 
sacred capital w
ithout a struggl
"e, or are we to"
 defend it?” A
 prolonged and g
eneral silence f
ollowed. There w
as a frown on e
very face and on
ly Kutúzov’s 
angry grunts and
 occasional coug
h broke the sil
ence. All eyes w
ere gazing at hi
m. Malásha too 
looked at “Gr
anddad.” She w
as nearest to hi
m and saw how hi
s face puckered;
 he seemed abou
"t to cry, but th"
is did not last 
long.  “Russ
ia’s ancient a
nd sacred capita
l!” he suddenl
"y said, repeatin"
g Bennigsen’s
 words in an ang
ry voice and the
reby drawing att
ention to the f
alse note in the
m. “Allow me t
"o tell you, your"
" excellency, tha"
t that question
 has no meaning 
for a Russian.�
� (He lurched hi
s heavy body fo
rward.) “Such 
a question canno
t be put; it is 
senseless! The q
uestion I have 
asked these gent
lemen to meet to
 discuss is a mi
litary one. The
 question is tha
t of saving Russ
ia. Is it better
 to give up Mosc
ow without a ba
"ttle, or by acce"
pting battle to 
risk losing the 
army as well as
 Moscow? That is
 the question on
 which I want yo
"ur opinion,” a"
nd he sank back
 in his chair. 
 The discussion
 began. Bennigse
n did not yet co
nsider his game 
lost. Admitting
 the view of Bar
clay and others 
that a defensive
 battle at Fil�
� was impossible
", but imbued wit"
h Russian patrio
tism and the lov
"e
of Moscow, he"
 proposed to mov
e troops from th
e right to the l
eft flank durin
g the night and 
attack the Frenc
h right flank th
e following day.
 Opinions were 
"divided, and arg"
uments were adva
nced for and aga
inst that proje
"ct. Ermólov, Do"
"khtúrov, and Ra"
évski agreed wi
th Bennigsen. Wh
ether feeling i
t necessary to m
ake a sacrifice 
before abandonin
g the capital o
r guided by othe
"r, personal cons"
"iderations, thes"
e generals seeme
d not to unders
tand that this c
ouncil could not
 alter the inevi
table course of
 events and that
 Moscow was in e
ffect already ab
andoned. The oth
"er
generals, ho"
"wever, understoo"
"d it and, leavin"
g aside the ques
"tion of
Moscow,"
 spoke of the di
rection the army
 should take in 
its retreat. Ma
"lásha, who kept"
 her eyes fixed 
on what was goin
"g on before her,"
 understood the
 meaning of the 
council differen
tly. It seemed t
o her that it w
as only a person
al struggle betw
een “Granddad�
�� and “Long-c
oat” as she t
ermed Bennigsen.
 She saw that th
ey grew spiteful
 when they spoke
 to one another
", and in her hea"
rt she sided wit
h “Granddad.�
� In the midst o
f the conversat
ion she noticed 
“Granddad” g
ive Bennigsen a 
"quick, subtle
g"
"lance, and then "
to her joys she 
saw that “Gran
ddad” said som
ething to “Lo
ng-coat” which
 settled him. Be
nnigsen suddenly
 reddened and pa
ced angrily up 
and down the roo
m. What so affec
ted him was Kut�
�zov’s calm a
nd quiet comment
 on the advantag
e or disadvantag
e of Bennigsen�
�s proposal to 
move troops by n
ight from the ri
ght to the left 
flank to attack
 the French righ
t wing.  “Ge
"ntlemen,” said"
" Kutúzov, “I "
cannot approve o
f the count’s 
plan. Moving tr
oops in close pr
oximity to an en
emy is always da
"ngerous, and mil"
itary history s
upports that vie
w. For instance.
..” Kutúzov s
eemed to reflect
",
searching for"
" an example, the"
"n with a clear, "
naïve look at B
ennigsen he add
ed: “Oh yes; t
ake the battle o
"f Friedland, whi"
ch I think the c
ount well remem
"bers, and which "
was... not fully
" successful, onl"
y because our t
roops were rearr
anged too near t
he enemy....” 
  There followe
d a momentary pa
"use, which seeme"
d very long to t
hem all.  The 
discussion recom
"menced, but paus"
es frequently oc
curred and they 
all felt that t
here was no more
 to be said.  
During one of th
ese pauses Kutú
zov heaved a dee
p sigh as if pre
paring to speak
. They all looke
d at him.  “
"Well, gentlemen,"
 I see that it i
s I who will hav
e to pay for the
 broken crocker
"y,” said he, a"
nd rising slowly
 he moved to the
 table. “Gentl
"emen,
I have he"
ard your views. 
Some of you will
 not agree with 
"me. But I,” he"
"
paused, “by "
the authority en
trusted to me by
 my Sovereign an
"d country,
orde"
r a retreat.” 
  After that th
e generals began
 to disperse wit
h the solemnity 
and circumspect
 silence of peop
le who are leavi
"ng, after a fune"
ral.  Some of 
"the generals, in"
 low tones and i
n a strain very 
different from 
the way they had
 spoken during t
"he council, comm"
unicated somethi
ng to their com
mander in chief.
"

Malásha, wh"
o had long been 
expected for sup
"per, climbed car"
efully backward
s down from the 
"oven, her bare l"
ittle feet catch
ing at its proj
"ections, and sli"
pping between th
e legs of the ge
nerals she darte
d out of the ro
om.  When he h
ad dismissed the
 generals Kutúz
ov sat a long ti
me with his elb
ows on the table
", thinking alway"
s of the same te
rrible question:
"
“When, when "
did the abandonm
ent of Moscow be
come inevitable?
 When was that 
done which settl
ed the matter? A
nd who was to bl
ame for it?” 
 “I did not e
"xpect this,” s"
aid he to his ad
jutant Schneider
 when the latte
r came in late t
hat night. “I 
did not expect t
his! I did not t
hink this would
 happen.”  �
��You should tak

hneider.  “B
ut no! They shal

ed Kutúzov wit

triking the tabl

 fist. “They 
"shall too, if on"

  CHAPTER V  
 At that very ti
"me, in circumsta"
nces even more i
mportant than re
treating withou
"t a battle, name"
ly the evacuatio
n and burning of
" Moscow,
Rostop"
"chín, who is us"
ually represente
d as being the i
nstigator of tha
"t
event, acted "
in an altogether
 different manne
r from Kutúzov.
  After the ba
ttle of Borodin�
� the abandonmen
t and burning of
 Moscow was as 
inevitable as th
e retreat of the
 army beyond Mos
cow without figh
ting.  Every R
ussian might hav
"e predicted it, "
not by reasoning
 but by the fee
ling implanted i
n each of us and
 in our fathers.
  The same thi
ng that took pla
ce in Moscow had
 happened in all
 the towns and 
villages on Russ
ian soil beginni
ng with Smoléns
"k, without the
"
participation of
 Count Rostopch�
�n and his broad
sheets. The peop
le awaited the 
enemy unconcerne
"dly, did not rio"
t or become exci
ted or tear any
"one to pieces, b"
ut faced its fat
"e, feeling withi"
n it the strengt
h to find what 
it should do at 
that most diffic
ult moment. And 
as soon as the 
enemy drew near 
the wealthy clas
ses went away ab
andoning their p
"roperty,
while "
the poorer remai
ned and burned a
nd destroyed wha
t was left.  T
he consciousness
 that this would
 be so and would
 always be so wa
s and is presen
t in the heart o
f every Russian.
 And a conscious
"ness of this,
a"
nd a foreboding 
that Moscow woul
"d be taken, was "
present in Russi
an Moscow socie
ty in 1812. Thos
e who had quitte
d Moscow already
 in July and at
 the beginning o
f August showed 
that they expect
ed this. Those w
"ho
went away, t"
aking what they 
could and abando
ning their house
s and half thei
"r belongings, di"
d so from the la
tent patriotism 
which expresses 
 itself not by p
hrases or by giv
ing one’s chil
dren to save the
 fatherland and
 similar unnatur
"al exploits, but"
" unobtrusively, "
"simply, organica"
"lly,
and theref"
ore in the way t
hat always produ
ces the most pow
erful results. 
 “It is disgr
aceful to run aw
ay from danger; 
only cowards are
 running away f
"rom Moscow,” t"
hey were told. I
n his broadsheet
s Rostopchín i
mpressed on them
 that to leave M
oscow was shamef
ul. They were as
hamed to be cal
"led cowards, ash"
"amed to leave, b"
ut still they le
"ft, knowing
it "
had to be done. 
Why did they go?
 It is impossibl
e to suppose tha
t Rostopchín h
ad scared them b
y his accounts o
f horrors Napole
on had committe
d in conquered c
ountries. The fi
rst people to go
 away were the 
rich educated pe
ople who knew qu
ite well that Vi
enna and Berlin 
had remained in
tact and that du
ring Napoleon’
s occupation the
 inhabitants ha
d spent their ti
me pleasantly in
 the company of 
the charming Fre
nchmen whom the
" Russians, and e"
specially the Ru
"ssian ladies, th"
en liked so muc
h.  They went 
away because for
 Russians there 
could be no ques
tion as to whet
her things would
 go well or ill 
under French rul
e in Moscow. It 
was out of the 
question to be u
nder French rule
", it would be th"
e worst thing t
hat could happen
. They went away
 even before the
 battle of Borod
inó and still 
more rapidly aft
"er it, despite R"
ostopchín’s c
alls to defend M
oscow or the an
nouncement of hi
s intention to t
ake the wonder-w
orking icon of 
the Iberian Moth
er of God and go
" to fight, or of"
 the balloons th
at were to dest
"roy the French, "
and despite all 
the nonsense Ros
topchín wrote i
n his broadshee
ts. They knew th
at it was for th
"e army to fight,"
 and that if it
 could not succe
ed it would not 
do to take young
 ladies and hous
e serfs to the 
Three Hills quar
ter of Moscow to
" fight Napoleon,"
 and that they 
"must go away, so"
rry as they were
 to abandon thei
r property to d
estruction. They
 went away witho
ut thinking of t
he tremendous s
ignificance of t
hat immense and 
wealthy city bei
ng given over to
"
destruction, f"
or a great city 
with wooden buil
dings was certai
n when abandone
d by its inhabit
ants to be burne
d. They went awa
y each on his o
"wn account, and "
yet it was only 
in consequence o
f their going aw
ay that the mom
entous event was
 accomplished th
at will always r
emain the great
est glory of the
 Russian people.
" The lady who, a"
fraid of being 
stopped by Count
 Rostopchín’s
" orders, had alr"
eady in June mov
ed with her Neg
roes and her wom

  CHAPTER VI  
"
Hélène, havin"
g returned with 
the court from V
ílna to Petersb
"urg, found
hers"
elf in a difficu
lt position.  
In Petersburg sh
e had enjoyed th
e special protec
tion of a grande
e who occupied 
one of the highe
st posts in the 
Empire. In Víln
a she had formed
 an intimacy wi
th a young forei
gn prince. When 
she returned to 
Petersburg both
 the magnate and
 the prince were
" there, and both"
 claimed their 
rights. Hélène
 was faced by a 
new problem—ho
w to preserve he
r intimacy with
 both without of
fending either. 
  What would ha
ve seemed diffic
ult or even impo
ssible to anothe
r woman did not
 cause the least
 embarrassment t
o Countess Bezú
"khova, who evide"
ntly deserved h
er reputation of
 being a very cl
ever woman. Had 
she attempted c
"oncealment, or t"
ried to extricat
e herself from h
er awkward posit
"ion
by cunning,"
 she would have 
spoiled her case
 by acknowledgin
g herself guilt
"y. But Hélène,"
 like a really g
reat man who can
 do whatever he
" pleases, at onc"
e assumed her ow
n position to be
" correct, as she"
 sincerely beli
"eved it to be, a"
nd that everyone
 else was to bla
me.  The first
 time the young 
foreigner allowe
d himself to rep
"roach her, she
"
lifted her beaut
"iful head and, h"
alf turning to h
"im, said firmly:"
 “That’s ju
st like a man—
selfish and crue
l! I expected no
thing else. A wo
man sacrifices 
"herself for you,"
" she suffers, an"
d this is her re
ward! What righ
"t have you, mons"
"eigneur, to dema"
nd an account of
 my attachments 
and friendships
? He is a man wh
o has been more 
than a father to
 me!” The pri
nce was about to
" say something, "
but Hélène int
errupted him.  
"
“Well, yes,�"
"� said she, “i"
t may be that he
 has other senti
ments for me th
an those of a fa
"ther, but that i"
s not a reason f
or me to shut my
 door on him. I
" am not a man, t"
hat I should rep
ay kindness with
 ingratitude! K
"now, monseigneur"
", that in all th"
at relates to my
 intimate feelin
gs I render acc
ount only to God
 and to my consc
"ience,” she co"
"ncluded, laying"
 her hand on her
" beautiful, full"
y expanded bosom
 and looking up 
to heaven.  �
��But for heaven
’s sake listen
 to me!”  �
"�Marry me, and I"
 will be your sl
ave!”  “Bu
t that’s impos
sible.”  “
You won’t deig
n to demean your
self by marrying
" me, you...” s"
"aid Hélène,
b"
eginning to cry.
  The prince t
ried to comfort 
"her, but Hélèn"
"e, as if quite d"
"istraught,
said"
 through her tea
rs that there wa
s nothing to pre
vent her marryin
"g,
that there w"
ere precedents (
there were up to
 that time very 
"few, but
she me"
ntioned Napoleon
 and some other 
exalted personag
"es), that she ha"
d never been he
r husband’s wi
"fe, and that she"
 had been sacrif
iced.  “But 
"the law, religio"
n...” said the
" prince, already"
 yielding.  �
"�The law, religi"
on... What have 
they been invent
ed for if they c
an’t arrange 
that?” said H�
�lène.  The p
rince was surpri
sed that so simp
le an idea had n
ot occurred to h
"im,
and he appl"
ied for advice t
o the holy breth
ren of the Socie
"ty of Jesus,
wi"
th whom he was o
n intimate terms
.  A few days 
later at one of 
those enchanting
 fetes which Hé
lène gave at h
er country house
 on the Stone Is
"land, the charmi"
ng Monsieur de J
"obert,
a man no"
" longer young, w"
ith snow white h
air and brillian
"t black eyes,
a"
 Jesuit à robe 
courte * was pre
"sented to her, a"
nd in the garden
 by the light o
f the illuminati
ons and to the s
ound of music ta
lked to her for 
a long time of 
"the love of God,"
" of Christ, of t"
"he Sacred Heart,"
 and of the con
solations the on
e true Catholic 
religion affords
 in this world a
nd the next. H�
�lène was touch
"ed, and more tha"
n once tears ros
e to her eyes a
nd to those of M
onsieur de Jober
t and their voic
es trembled. A d
"ance,
for which"
 her partner cam
"e to seek her, p"
ut an end to her
 discourse with 
 her future dire
cteur de conscie
"nce, but the nex"
t evening Monsie
ur de Jobert ca
me to see Hélè
ne when she was 
"alone, and after"
 that often came
 again.      
* Lay member of 
the Society of J
esus.  One day
 he took the cou
ntess to a Roman
 Catholic church
", where she knel"
t down before t
he altar to whic
h she was led. T
"he enchanting, m"
iddle-aged Fren
chman laid his h
ands on her head
" and, as she her"
self afterward 
"described it, sh"
e felt something
 like a fresh br
eeze wafted into
 her soul. It w
as explained to 
her that this wa
s la grâce.  
After that a lon
g-frocked abbé 
was brought to h
er. She confesse
"d to
him, and h"
e absolved her f
rom her sins. Ne
xt day she recei
ved a box conta
ining the Sacred
" Host, which was"
 left at her hou
se for her to p
artake of. A few
 days later Hél
ène learned wit
h pleasure that 
she had now bee
n admitted to th
e true Catholic 
Church and that 
in a few days th
e Pope himself 
would hear of he
r and would send
 her a certain d
ocument.  All 
that was done ar
ound her and to 
her at this time
", all the attent"
ion devoted to 
her by so many c
lever men and ex
pressed in such 
"pleasant,
refin"
"ed ways, and the"
 state of dove-l
ike purity she w
as now in (she w
ore only white 
dresses and whit
e ribbons all th
at time) gave he
"r pleasure,
but"
 her pleasure di
d not cause her 
for a moment to 
forget her aim. 
And as it alway
s happens in con
tests of cunning
 that a stupid p
erson gets the 
better of clever
"er ones, Hélèn"
e—having reali
zed that the mai
n object of all
 these words and
 all this troubl
"e was, after con"
verting her to 
"Catholicism, to "
obtain money fro
m her for Jesuit
 institutions (a
s to which she 
received indicat
ions)—before p
arting with her 
money insisted 
that the various
 operations nece
ssary to free he
r from her husba
nd should be pe
rformed. In her 
view the aim of 
every religion w
as merely to pr
eserve certain p
roprieties while
 affording satis
faction to huma
n desires. And w
"ith this aim, in"
 one of her talk
s with her Fathe
"r
Confessor, sh"
e insisted on an
 answer to the q
"uestion, in how "
far was she bou
nd by her marria
ge?  They were
 sitting in the 
twilight by a wi
ndow in the draw
ing room. The s
cent of flowers 
came in at the w
indow. Hélène 
was wearing a wh
"ite
dress, tran"
sparent over her
 shoulders and b
"osom. The abbé,"
 a well-fed man
" with a plump, c"
lean-shaven chin
", a pleasant fir"
"m mouth, and whi"
te hands meekly
 folded on his k
"nees, sat close "
"to Hélène and,"
 with a subtle 
smile on his lip
s and a peaceful
 look of delight
" at her beauty,"
 occasionally gl
anced at her fac
e as he explaine
d his opinion on
 the subject. H
élène with an 
uneasy smile loo
ked at his curly
 hair and his p
"lump, clean-shav"
"en, blackish che"
eks and every mo
ment expected th
e conversation 
to take a fresh 
turn. But the ab
"bé, though he e"
vidently enjoye
d the beauty of 
"his companion, w"
as absorbed in h
is mastery of th
e matter.  Th
e course of the 
Father Confessor
’s arguments r
an as follows: �
��Ignorant of t
he import of wha
t you were under
"taking, you made"
 a vow of conjug
al fidelity to 
a man who on his
" part, by enteri"
ng the married s
tate without fa
ith in the relig
ious significanc
"e of marriage, c"
ommitted an act 
of sacrilege. T
hat marriage lac
ked the dual sig
nificance it sho
uld have had. Y
et in spite of t
his your vow was
 binding. You sw
erved from it. 
What did you com
mit by so acting
"? A venial, or a"
" mortal, sin? A "
"venial
sin, for"
 you acted witho
ut evil intentio
n. If now you ma
rried again wit
h the object of 
bearing children
", your sin might"
 be forgiven. Bu
t the question 
is again a twofo
ld one: firstly.
..”  But sud
"denly Hélène, "
who was getting 
"bored, said with"
 one of her bew
itching smiles: 
“But I think t
hat having espou
sed the true rel
igion I cannot 
be bound by what
 a false religio
n laid upon me.�
��  The direct
or of her consci
ence was astound
ed at having the
 case presented
 to him thus wit
h the simplicity
 of Columbus’ 
egg. He was del
ighted at the un
expected rapidit
y of his pupil�
"�s progress, but"
 could not aban
don the edifice 
of argument he h
ad laboriously c
onstructed.  �
��Let us underst

     CHAPTER
 VII  Hélène
 understood that
 the question wa
s very simple an
d easy from the
 ecclesiastical 
"point of view, a"
nd that her dire
ctors were makin
g difficulties 
only because the
y were apprehens
ive as to how th
e matter would 
be regarded by t
he secular autho
rities.  So sh
e decided that i
t was necessary 
to prepare the o
pinion of societ
y. She provoked
 the jealousy of
 the elderly mag
nate and told hi
m what she had 
told her other s
"uitor; that is, "
she put the matt
er so that the o
nly way for him
 to obtain a rig
ht over her was 
to marry her. Th
e elderly magna
te was at first 
as much taken ab
ack by this sugg
estion of marria
ge with a woman
 whose husband w
"as alive, as the"
 younger man had
" been, but
Hél"
ène’s impertu
rbable convictio
n that it was as
 simple and natu
ral as marrying
 a maiden had it
s effect on him 
too. Had Hélèn
e herself shown 
 the least sign 
"of hesitation, s"
"hame, or secrecy"
", her cause woul"
d certainly hav
e been lost; but
 not only did sh
e show no signs 
of secrecy or s
"hame, on the con"
"trary, with good"
-natured naïvet
é she told her 
 intimate friend
s (and these wer
e all Petersburg
) that both the 
prince and the 
magnate had prop
osed to her and 
that she loved b
oth and was afr
aid of grieving 
either.  A rum
or immediately s
pread in Petersb
"urg, not that H�"
�lène wanted to
 be divorced fr
om her husband (
had such a repor
t spread many wo
uld have oppose
d so illegal an 
intention) but s
imply that the u
nfortunate and 
interesting Hél
ène was in doub
t which of the t
wo men she shoul
d marry. The qu
estion was no lo
nger whether thi
"s was possible, "
but only which w
as the better m
atch and how the
 matter would be
 regarded at cou
"rt. There
were,"
" it is true, som"
e rigid individu
als unable to ri
se to the height
 of such a ques
"tion, who saw in"
 the project a d
esecration of th
e sacrament of 
"marriage, but th"
ere were not man
y such and they 
"remained silent,"
 while the majo
rity were intere
sted in Hélène
’s good fortun
e and in the qu
estion which mat
ch would be the 
more advantageou
s. Whether it wa
s right or wron
g to remarry whi
le one had a hus
band living they
 did not discus
"s, for that ques"
tion had evident
ly been settled 
by people “wis
er than you or 
"me,” as they s"
"aid, and to doub"
t the correctnes
s of that decis
ion would be to 
risk exposing on
e’s stupidity 
and incapacity t
o live in socie
ty.  Only Már
ya Dmítrievna A
"khrosímova, who"
 had come to Pet
ersburg that su
mmer to see one 
"of her sons, all"
owed herself pla
inly to express 
 an opinion cont
rary to the gene
ral one. Meeting
 Hélène at a b
all she stopped
 her in the midd
le of the room a
"nd, amid general"
" silence, said
"
in her gruff voi
ce: “So wives 
of living men ha
ve started marry
ing again! Perh
aps you think yo
u have invented 
a novelty? You h
ave been forest
"alled, my dear! "
It was thought o
f long ago. It i
s done in all th

and with these w
ords Márya Dmí
"trievna, turning"
 up her wide sl
eeves with her u
sual threatening
 gesture and gla
ncing sternly ro
"und,
moved acro"
ss the room.  
Though people we
re afraid of Má
rya Dmítrievna 
she was regarded
 in Petersburg 
"as a buffoon, an"
d so of what she
 had said they o
"nly noticed,
an"
d repeated in a 
"whisper, the one"
 coarse word she
" had used, suppo"
sing the whole 
sting of her rem
ark to lie in th
at word.  Prin
"ce Vasíli, who "
of late very oft
en forgot what h
e had said and 
repeated one and
 the same thing 
"a hundred times,"
 remarked to his
 daughter whene
ver he chanced t
o see her:  �
"�Hélène, I hav"
e a word to say 
"to you,” and h"
e would lead her
"
aside, drawing"
 her hand downwa

"... But, my

 only your own h

"l I have to say,"
” and conceal
ing his unvaryin

 move away.  B

"��Listen, Bilíb"

ène (she always

�  Bilíbin wr
inkled up the sk
in over his eyeb

"d, with a
smile"
 on his lips.  
 “You are not 
taking me unawar

 said he. “As 
"a true friend,
"
I have thought a

ant the younger 
man—and he cro

 “you forever

in shrugged his

 “Une maîtres

 “Will he agre

“Oh, "

Bilíbin puckere
d his skin in pr

 “Even divorc

e.  Hélène l
aughed.  Among
 those who ventu
red to doubt the
 justifiability 
of the proposed 
 marriage was H�
�lène’s mothe
"r, Princess Kur�"
�gina. She was c
ontinually torm
ented by jealous
y of her daughte
"r, and now that "
jealousy concern
ed a subject ne
ar to her own he
"art, she could n"
ot reconcile her
self to the ide
a. She consulted
 a Russian pries
t as to the poss
ibility of divor
ce and remarria
ge during a husb
and’s lifetime
", and the priest"
 told her that 
it was impossibl
"e, and to her de"
light showed her
 a text in the G
ospel which (as
 it seemed to hi
m) plainly forbi
ds remarriage wh
ile the husband 
 is alive.  Ar
med with these a
"rguments, which "
appeared to her 
"unanswerable, sh"
e drove to her 
daughter’s ear
ly one morning s
o as to find her
 alone.  Havin
g listened to he
r mother’s obj

e smiled blandly
 and ironically
.  “But it s
ays plainly: ‘
Whosoever shall 
marry her that i

” said the ol
d princess.  �
"��Ah, Maman, ne "
dites pas de bê

élène changing

“But, my dear"

  Just then the
 lady companion 
who lived with H
élène came in 
to announce tha
t His Highness w
as in the ballro
om and wished to
 see her.  “
"Non, dites-lui q"
ue je ne veux pa

” *       * 
"“No, tell him "

      * “Coun

 young man who h
ad entered took
 no notice of he

nodded to her da

“Yes, s"

thought the old

"She is right, bu"
t how is it tha
t we in our irre
coverable youth 
did not know it?
 Yet it is so s
"imple,” she th"
ought as she got
 into her carria

beginning of Aug
ust Hélène’s
 affairs were cl
early defined an
d she wrote a l

"he imagined, lov"

h—informing hi
m of her intenti

" one true faith,"
 and asking him 
to carry out all
 the formalitie
s necessary for 
"a divorce, which"
 would be explai
ned to him by t

 letter.  And 
so I pray God to
" have you, my fr"

keeping—Your f

  This letter w
as brought to Pi
erre’s house w
hen he was on th
e field of Boro
dinó.     
 CHAPTER VIII 
 Toward the end
 of the battle o
"f Borodinó, Pie"
"rre, having run "
down from Raév
ski’s battery 
"a second time, m"
ade his way thro
ugh a gully to 
Knyazkóvo with 
a crowd of soldi
"ers, reached the"
 dressing statio
"n, and
seeing b"
lood and hearing
 cries and groan
"s hurried on, st"
ill entangled in
 the crowds of 
soldiers.  The
 one thing he no
w desired with h
is whole soul wa
s to get away qu
ickly from the 
terrible sensati
ons amid which h
e had lived that
 day and return 
 to ordinary con
ditions of life 
and sleep quietl
y in a room in h
is own bed. He 
felt that only i
n the ordinary c
onditions of lif
e would he be a
ble to understan
d himself and al
l he had seen an
d felt. But such
 ordinary condi
tions of life we
re nowhere to be
 found.  Thoug
h shells and bul
lets did not whi
stle over the ro
ad along which h
"e
was going, st"
ill on all sides
 there was what 
there had been o
n the field of 
battle. There we
re still the sam
"e suffering, exh"
"austed, and some"
times strangely
 indifferent fac
"es, the same blo"
"od, the same sol"
diers’ overco
"ats, the same so"
unds of firing w
"hich, though dis"
"tant now, still"
"
aroused terror,"
 and besides thi
s there were the
 foul air and th
e dust.  Havin
g gone a couple 
of miles along t
he Mozháysk roa
"d, Pierre sat do"
wn by the roads
ide.  Dusk had
" fallen, and the"
 roar of guns di
ed away. Pierre 
lay leaning on 
his elbow for a 
"long time, gazin"
g at the shadows
 that moved past
 him in the dar
kness. He was co
ntinually imagin
ing that a canno
n ball was flyin
g toward him wi
th a terrific wh
"izz, and then he"
 shuddered and s
at up. He had n
o idea how long 
he had been ther
e. In the middle
 of the night th
"ree
soldiers, h"
aving brought so
"me firewood, set"
tled down near h
im and began li
ghting a fire. 
"
The soldiers, "
who threw sidelo
ng glances at Pi
"erre, got the fi"
re to burn and 
placed an iron p
ot on it into wh
ich they broke s
ome dried bread 
and put a littl
e dripping. The 
pleasant odor of
 greasy viands m
ingled with the
 smell of smoke.
 Pierre sat up a
nd sighed. The t
hree soldiers we
re eating and t
alking among the
"mselves, taking "
no notice of him
.  “And who 
may you be?” o
ne of them sudde
nly asked Pierre
", evidently
mea"
ning what Pierre
 himself had in 
"mind, namely: �"
�If you want to 
eat we’ll giv
"e you some food,"
 only let us kno
w whether you ar
e an honest man
".”

“I, I."
..” said Pierr
"e, feeling it ne"
cessary to minim
ize his social 
position as much
 as possible so 
as to be nearer 
to the soldiers 
and better unde
rstood by them. 
“By rights I a
m a militia offi
"cer, but my men"
 are not here. I
 came to the bat
tle and have los
t them.”  �
�There now!” s
aid one of the s
oldiers.  Anot
her shook his he
ad.  “Would 
you like a littl
e mash?” the f
irst soldier ask
"ed, and handed
"
Pierre a wooden 
spoon after lick
ing it clean.  
 Pierre sat down
 by the fire and
 began eating th
"e mash, as they "
called the food
 in the cauldron
", and he thought"
 it more delicio
us than any food
 he had ever ta
sted. As he sat 
bending greedily
" over it, helpin"
g himself to la
rge spoonfuls an
d chewing one af
"ter another, his"
 face was lit up
 by the fire an
d the soldiers l
ooked at him in 
silence.  “W
here have you to
 go to? Tell us!
” said one of 
them.  “To M
ozháysk.”  
“You’re a ge
"ntleman, aren’"
t you?”  “
Yes.”  “An
d what’s your 
name?”  “P
eter Kirílych.�
��  “Well th
"en, Peter Kiríl"
"ych, come along "
"with us, we’ll"
 take you there.
”  In the to
tal darkness the
 soldiers walked
 with Pierre to 
Mozháysk.  By
 the time they g
ot near Mozháys
k and began asce
nding the steep 
hill into the t
"own, the cocks w"
ere already crow
ing. Pierre went
 on with the so
"ldiers, quite fo"
rgetting that hi
s inn was at the
 bottom of the h
ill and that he
 had already pas
sed it. He would
 not soon have r
"emembered
this,"
 such was his st
ate of forgetful
"ness, had he not"
 halfway up the 
 hill stumbled u
"pon his groom, w"
ho had been to l
ook for him in t
he town and was
 returning to th
e inn. The groom
 recognized Pier
re in the darkn
ess by his white
 hat.  “Your
 excellency!” 
"he said. “Why,"
 we were beginni
ng to despair! H
ow is it you ar
e on foot? And w
here are you goi
"ng, please?”
"
"
“Oh, yes!”"
 said Pierre.  
 The soldiers st
opped.  “So 
you’ve found y
our folk?” sai
d one of them. �
"��Well, good-by,"
 Peter Kirílyc
h—isn’t it?�
��  “Good-by
", Peter Kirílyc"
h!” Pierre hea
rd the other voi
ces repeat.  �
��Good-by!” he
 said and turned
 with his groom 
toward the inn. 
  “I ought to
 give them somet
hing!” he thou
"ght, and felt in"
 his pocket. �
"�No, better not!"
” said another
", inner voice.
"
 There was not 
a room to be had
" at the inn, the"
y were all occup
ied. Pierre wen
t out into the y
"ard and, coverin"
g himself up hea
"d and all, lay
"
down in his carr
iage.      
 CHAPTER IX  S
carcely had Pier
re laid his head
 on the pillow b
efore he felt hi
mself falling a
"sleep, but sudde"
"nly, almost with"
 the distinctnes
"s of reality,
h"
e heard the boom
", boom, boom of "
"firing, the thud"
" of projectiles,"
 groans and cri
"es, and smelled "
blood and powder
", and a feeling "
of horror and d
read of death se
ized him. Filled
 with fright he 
opened his eyes 
and lifted his 
head from under 
his cloak. All w
as tranquil in t
he yard. Only s
omeone’s order
ly passed throug
"h the gateway, s"
plashing through
" the mud,
and t"
alked to the inn
keeper. Above Pi
erre’s head so
"me pigeons, dist"
urbed by the mo
vement he had ma
de in sitting up
", fluttered unde"
r the dark roof 
 of the penthous
e. The whole cou
rtyard was perme
ated by a strong
 peaceful smell
 of stable yards
", delightful to "
Pierre at that m
oment. He could 
see the clear s
tarry sky betwee
n the dark roofs
 of two penthous
es.  “Thank 
"God, there is no"
 more of that!�
"� he thought, co"
vering up his he
ad again. “Oh
", what a terribl"
"e thing is fear,"
 and how shamefu
lly I yielded t
o it! But they..
. they were stea
dy and calm all 
"the time, to the"
 end...” thou
"ght he.

They,"
 in Pierre’s m
"ind, were the so"
"ldiers, those wh"
o had been at th
"e
battery, thos"
e who had given 
"him food, and th"
ose who had pray
ed before the i
"con. They, those"
 strange men he 
had not previous
"ly known, stood "
out clearly and
 sharply from ev
eryone else.  
“To be a soldi
"er, just a soldi"
er!” thought P
ierre as he fell
" asleep,
“to "
enter communal l
"ife completely, "
to be imbued by 
what makes them 
what they are. 
But how to cast 
off all the supe
"rfluous, devilis"
h burden of my 
outer man? There
 was a time when
 I could have do
ne it. I could h
ave run away fr
"om my father, as"
 I wanted to. Or
 I might have be
en sent to serve
 as a soldier a
fter the duel wi
th Dólokhov.”
 And the memory 
of the dinner a
t the English Cl
ub when he had c
hallenged Dólok
hov flashed thro
ugh Pierre’s 
"mind, and then h"
e remembered his
 benefactor at T
orzhók. And now
 a picture of a
 solemn meeting 
of the lodge pre
sented itself to
 his mind. It w
as taking place 
at the English C
lub and someone 
near and dear to
 him sat at the
 end of the tabl
"e. “Yes, that "
is he! It is my 
benefactor. But
 he died!” tho
ught Pierre. “
"Yes, he died, an"
d I did not know
 he was alive. 
How sorry I am t
"hat he died, and"
 how glad I am t
hat he is alive 
 again!” On on
e side of the ta
"ble sat Anatole,"
" Dólokhov, Nesv"
"ítski,
Deníso"
"v, and others li"
ke them (in his 
dream the catego
ry to which thes
e men belonged 
was as clearly d
efined in his mi
nd as the catego
ry of those he 
"termed they), an"
d he heard those
" people, Anatole"
" and Dólokhov,"
 shouting and si
nging loudly; ye
t through their 
shouting the voi
ce of his benef
actor was heard 
speaking all the
 time and the so
und of his words
 was as weighty
 and uninterrupt
ed as the boomin
g on the battlef
"ield, but
pleas"
ant and comforti
ng. Pierre did n
ot understand wh
at his benefacto
"r
was saying, b"
ut he knew (the 
categories of th
oughts were also
 quite distinct
 in his dream) t
hat he was talki
ng of goodness a
nd the possibil
ity of being wha
t they were. And
 they with their
" simple, kind,
"
firm faces surro
unded his benefa
ctor on all side
s. But though th
ey were kindly 
they did not loo
k at Pierre and 
did not know him
. Wishing to sp
eak and to attra
ct their attenti
"on, he got up, b"
ut at that momen
t his legs grew
 cold and bare. 
  He felt asham
"ed, and with one"
 arm covered his
 legs from which
 his cloak had 
in fact slipped.
 For a moment as
 he was rearrang
ing his cloak Pi
erre opened his
 eyes and saw th
e same penthouse
" roofs, posts, a"
"nd yard, but
no"
w they were all 
"bluish, lit up, "
and glittering w
ith frost or dew
.  “It is da
"wn,” thought P"
ierre. “But th
at’s not what 
I want. I want t
o hear and unde
rstand my benefa
ctor’s words.�
�� Again he cove
red himself up 
"with his cloak, "
but now neither 
the lodge nor hi
s benefactor was
 there. There w
ere only thought
s clearly expres
"sed in words, th"
oughts that som
eone was utterin
g or that he him
self was formula
ting.  Afterwa
rds when he reca
lled those thoug
hts Pierre was c
onvinced that s
omeone outside h
imself had spoke
"n them, though t"
he impressions o
f that day had 
evoked them. He 
"had never, it se"
"emed to him, bee"
n able to think 
 and express his
 thoughts like t
hat when awake. 
  “To endure 
war is the most 
difficult subord
ination of man�
�s freedom to t
"he law of God,�"
� the voice had 
said. “Simplic
ity is submissio
n to the will o
f God; you canno
t escape from Hi
m. And they are 
simple. They do 
"
not talk, but a"
ct. The spoken w
ord is silver bu
t the unspoken i
s golden. Man c
an be master of 
nothing while he
" fears death, bu"
t he who does no
t fear it posse
sses all. If the
re were no suffe
"ring, man would "
not know his li
"mitations, would"
 not know himsel
f. The hardest t
hing (Pierre wen
"t
on thinking, "
"or hearing, in h"
is dream) is to 
be able in your 
soul to unite t
he meaning of al
l. To unite all?
” he asked him
"self. “No, not"
 to unite. Thou
ghts cannot be u
"nited, but to ha"
rness all these 
thoughts togeth
er is what we ne
"ed! Yes, one mus"
"t harness them, "
must harness th
em!” he repeat
ed to himself wi
th inward raptur
"e, feeling that "
these words and
 they alone expr
essed what he wa
nted to say and 
solved the ques
tion that tormen
ted him.  “Y
"es, one must har"
"ness, it is time"
 to harness.” 
  “Time to ha
"rness, time to h"
"arness, your exc"
ellency! Your ex
cellency!” so
me voice was rep
eating. “We mu
"st harness, it i"
s time to harnes
s....”  It w
as the voice of 
"the groom, tryin"
g to wake him. T
he sun shone st
raight into Pier
re’s face. He 
glanced at the d
irty innyard in 
the middle of w
hich soldiers we
re watering thei
r lean horses at
 the pump while
 carts were pass
ing out of the g
ate. Pierre turn
ed away with re
"pugnance, and cl"
osing his eyes q
uickly fell back
 on the carriage
" seat.
“No, I"
 don’t want th
"at, I don’t wa"
nt to see and un
derstand that. I
 want to unders
tand what was re
vealing itself t
o me in my dream
. One second mo
re and I should 
have understood 
it all! But what
 am I to do? Har
"ness,
but how c"
an I harness eve
rything?” and 
Pierre felt with
 horror that the
 meaning of all
 he had seen and
 thought in the 
dream had been d
estroyed.  The
" groom, the coac"
"hman, and the in"
nkeeper told Pie
rre that an offi
cer had come wi
th news that the
 French were alr
eady near Mozhá
ysk and that ou
r men were leavi
ng it.  Pierre
" got up and, hav"
ing told them to
 harness and ove
"rtake him, went "
on foot through
 the town.  Th
e troops were mo
"ving on, leaving"
 about ten thous
and wounded behi
nd them. There 
were wounded in 
"the yards, at th"
e windows of the
" houses, and
th"
e streets were c
rowded with them
. In the streets
", around carts t"
hat were to tak
e some of the wo
"unded away, shou"
"ts, curses, and "
blows could be 
heard. Pierre of
fered the use of
" his carriage, w"
hich had overtak
"en
him, to a wo"
unded general he
" knew, and drove"
 with him to Mos
cow. On the way
 Pierre was told
 of the death of
 his brother-in-
law Anatole and 
of that of Prin
ce Andrew.   
   CHAPTER X 
  On the thirti
eth of August Pi
erre reached Mos
cow. Close to th
e gates of the 
city he was met 
by Count Rostopc
hín’s adjutan
t.  “We have
 been looking fo
r you everywhere
",” said the ad"
jutant. “The c
ount wants to s
ee you particula
rly. He asks you
 to come to him 
at once on a ve
ry important mat
ter.”  Witho
"ut going home, P"
ierre took a cab
 and drove to se
e the Moscow co
mmander in chief
.  Count Rosto
pchín had only 
that morning ret
urned to town fr
om his summer v
illa at Sokólni
ki. The anteroom
 and reception r
oom of his house
 were full of o
fficials who had
 been summoned o
r had come for o
rders. Vasílch
ikov and Plátov
 had already see
n the count and 
explained to him
 that it was im
possible to defe
nd Moscow and th
at it would have
 to be surrende
red. Though this
 news was being 
concealed from t
"he inhabitants,"
 the officials�
�the heads of th
e various govern
ment departments
—knew that Mo
scow would soon 
be in the enemy�
"��s hands, just "
as Count Rostopc
hín himself kn
"ew it, and to es"
cape personal re
sponsibility the
y had all come 
to the governor 
to ask how they 
were to deal wit
h their various 
 departments.  
 As Pierre was e
ntering the rece
ption room a cou
rier from the ar
my came out of 
Rostopchín’s 
private room.  
 In answer to qu
estions with whi
ch he was greete
"d, the courier m"
ade a despairin
g gesture with h
is hand and pass
ed through the r
oom.  While wa
iting in the rec
eption room Pier
re with weary ey
es watched the 
various official
"s, old and young"
", military and c"
"ivilian, who wer"
e there. They a
ll seemed dissat
isfied and uneas
y. Pierre went u
p to a group of 
"
men, one of who"
m he knew. After
 greeting Pierre
 they continued 
their conversat
ion.  “If th
ey’re sent out
 and brought bac
k again later on
 it will do no h
"arm,
but as thi"
ngs are now one 
can’t answer f
or anything.” 
  “But you se
e what he writes
...” said anot
"her, pointing to"
 a printed shee
t he held in his
 hand.  “Tha
t’s another ma
tter. That’s n
ecessary for the
" people,” said"
 the first.  
“What is it?�
� asked Pierre. 
"

“Oh, it’s"
 a fresh broadsh
eet.”  Pierr
e took it and be
gan reading.  
His Serene Highn
ess has passed t
hrough Mozháysk
 in order to joi
n up with the t
roops moving tow
ard him and has 
taken up a stron
g position where
 the enemy will
 not soon attack
 him. Forty-eigh
t guns with ammu
nition have bee
n sent him from 
"here, and his Se"
rene Highness sa
ys he will defe
nd Moscow to the
 last drop of bl
ood and is even 
ready to fight i
n the streets. 
"Do not be upset,"
" brothers, that "
the law courts a
re closed; thin
gs have to be pu
"t in order, and "
we will deal wit
h villains in ou
r own way! When
 the time comes 
I shall want bot
h town and peasa
nt lads and wil
l raise the cry 
a day or two bef
"orehand, but the"
y are not wanted
 yet so I hold 
my peace. An ax 
"will be useful, "
a hunting spear 
"not bad, but a
"
three-pronged fo
rk will be best 
of all: a French
man is no heavie
r than a sheaf 
of rye. Tomorrow
 after dinner I 
shall take the I
berian icon of 
the Mother of Go
d to the wounded
 in the Catherin
e Hospital where
 we will have s
ome water blesse
d. That will hel
p them to get we
"ll quicker. I,
"
"too, am well now"
: one of my eyes
 was sore but no
w I am on the lo
okout with both
.  “But mili
tary men have to
ld me that it is
 impossible to f
ight in the tow
"n,” said Pierr"
"e, “and that t"
he position...�
"�

“Well, of"
 course! That’
s what we were s
"aying,” replie"
d the first spe
aker.  “And 
what does he mea
n by ‘One of m
y eyes was sore 
but now I am on 
the lookout wit
h both’?” as
ked Pierre.  �
��The count had 
"a sty,” replie"
d the adjutant s
"miling, “and w"
as very much up
set when I told 
him people had c
ome to ask what 
was the matter w
ith him. By the
" by, Count,” h"
e added suddenly
", addressing Pie"
rre with a smil
"e, “we heard t"
hat you have fam
ily troubles and
 that the counte
"ss,
your wife.."
.”  “I hav
"e heard nothing,"
” Pierre repli
ed unconcernedly
. “But what ha
ve you heard?�
"�

“Oh, well"
", you know peopl"
e often invent t
hings. I only sa
y what I heard.
”  “But wh
at did you hear?
"”

“Well, "
"they say,” con"
tinued the adjut
ant with the sam
"e smile, “that"
"
the countess, "
"your wife, is pr"
eparing to go ab
road. I expect i
t’s nonsense.
...”  “Pos
"sibly,” remark"
"ed Pierre, looki"
ng about him abs
ent-mindedly. �
�And who is tha
"t?” he asked, "
indicating a sho
rt old man in a 
clean blue peasa
"nt
overcoat, wi"
th a big snow-wh
ite beard and ey
ebrows and a rud
dy face.  “H
e? That’s a tr
"adesman, that is"
" to say, he’s "
the restaurant 
"keeper, Vereshch"
ágin. Perhaps y
ou have heard of
 that affair wit
h the proclamat
ion.”  “Oh
", so that is Ver"
eshchágin!” s
"aid Pierre, look"
"ing at the firm,"
 calm face of t
he old man and s
eeking any indic
ation of his bei
ng a traitor.  
 “That’s not
" he himself, tha"
t’s the father
 of the fellow w
ho wrote the pr
"oclamation,” s"
aid the adjutant
. “The young m
an is in prison 
and I expect it
 will go hard wi
th him.”  An
 old gentleman w
earing a star an
d another offici
"al, a German wea"
ring a cross ro
"und his neck, ap"
proached the spe
aker.  “It�
�s a complicated
" story, you know"
",” said the ad"
jutant. “That 
 proclamation ap
peared about two
 months ago. The
 count was infor
med of it. He g
ave orders to in
vestigate the ma
tter. Gabriel Iv
ánovich here m
ade the inquirie
s. The proclamat
ion had passed t
hrough exactly 
sixty-three hand
"s. He asked one,"
 ‘From whom di
d you get it?’
 ‘From so-and
-so.’ He went 
to the next one.
 ‘From whom di
d you get it?’
 and so on till
 he reached Vere
"shchágin, a hal"
f educated trade
"sman, you know, "
‘a pet of a t
"rader,’” sai"
d the adjutant s
miling. “They 
"asked him, ‘Wh"
o gave it you?�
�� And the point
 is that we knew
 whom he had it 
from. He could 
only have had it
 from the Postma
ster. But eviden
tly they had com
e to some under
standing. He rep
lied: ‘From no
 one; I made it 
up myself.’ T
hey threatened a
nd questioned hi
"m, but he stuck "
to that: ‘I ma
de it up myself
.’ And so it w
as reported to t
"he count, who se"
nt for the man. 
 ‘From whom di
d you get the pr
oclamation?’ �
��I wrote it mys
"elf.’ Well, yo"
u know the coun
"t,” said the a"
djutant cheerful
"ly, with a smile"
" of pride,
“h"
e flared up drea
dfully—and jus
t think of the f
ellow’s audaci
"ty, lying,
and "
obstinacy!”  
 “And the coun
t wanted him to 
say it was from 
Klyucharëv? I u
nderstand!” s
aid Pierre.  �
"��Not at all,”"
 rejoined the ad
jutant in dismay
. “Klyucharëv
 had his own si
ns to answer for
 without that an
d that is why he
 has been banish
ed. But the poi
nt is that the c
ount was much an
noyed. ‘How co
uld you have wr
itten it yoursel
"f?’ said he, a"
nd he took up th
e Hamburg Gazett
e that was lyin
g on the table. 
‘Here it is! Y
ou did not write
 it yourself but
"
translated it,"
 and translated 
"it abominably, b"
ecause you don�
�t even know Fr
"ench, you fool.�"
�� And what do y
"ou think? ‘No,"
"’ said he, ‘"
I have not read
" any papers, I m"
ade it up myself
.’ ‘If that�
"��s so, you’re"
 a traitor and 
I’ll have you 
"tried, and you�"
�ll be hanged! S
ay from whom you
 had it.’ ‘
I have seen no p
"apers, I made it"
 up myself.’ A
nd that was the 
end of it. The 
count had the fa
"ther fetched, bu"
t the fellow stu
ck to it. He wa
s sent for trial
 and condemned t
"o hard labor, I "
believe. Now the
 father has com
e to intercede f
or him. But he�
�s a good-for-no
thing lad! You 
know that sort o
f tradesman’s 
"son, a dandy and"
 lady-killer. He
 attended some 
lectures somewhe
re and imagines 
that the devil i
s no match for 
him. That’s th
e sort of fellow
 he is. His fath
er keeps a cooks
hop here by the
" Stone Bridge, a"
nd you know ther
e was a large ic
on of God Almig
hty painted with
 a scepter in on
e hand and an or
b in the other. 
"
Well, he took t"
hat icon home wi
th him for a few
 days and what d
id he do? He fo
und some scoundr
el of a painter.
..”      
 CHAPTER XI  I
n the middle of 
this fresh tale 
Pierre was summo
ned to the comma
nder in chief. 
  When he enter
ed the private r
oom Count Rostop
"chín, puckering"
" his face,
was "
rubbing his fore
head and eyes wi
th his hand. A s
hort man was say
"ing
something, "
but when Pierre 
entered he stopp
ed speaking and 
went out.  “
"Ah, how do you d"
"o, great warrior"
?” said Rostop
chín as soon as
 the short man 
had left the roo
m. “We have he
ard of your prow
ess. But that’
s not the point
. Between oursel
"ves, mon cher, d"
o you belong to 
the Masons?” h
e went on sever
"ely, as though t"
here were someth
ing wrong about 
it which he nev
ertheless intend
ed to pardon. Pi
erre remained si
lent. “I am we
"ll
informed, my"
" friend, but I a"
m aware that the
re are Masons an
d I hope that y
ou are not one o
f those who on p
retense of savin
g mankind wish t
o ruin Russia.�
"��

“Yes, I "
"am a Mason,” P"
ierre replied. 
"
“There, you "
"see, mon cher! I"
 expect you know
 that Messrs. Sp
eránski and Ma
gnítski have be
en deported to t
heir proper plac
e. Mr. Klyuchar�
�v has been tre
ated in the same
" way, and so hav"
e others who on 
the plea of bui
lding up the tem
ple of Solomon h
ave tried to des
troy the temple 
of their father
land. You can un
derstand that th
ere are reasons 
for this and th
at I could not h
ave exiled the P
ostmaster had he
 not been a harm
ful person. It 
has now come to 
my knowledge tha
t you lent him y
our carriage fo
r his removal fr
"om town, and tha"
t you have even 
accepted papers 
from him for sa
fe custody. I li
ke you and don�
�t wish you any 
harm and—as y
ou are only half
 my age—I advi
"se you, as a fat"
"her would, to ce"
ase all communi
cation with men 
of that stamp an
d to leave here 
as soon as poss
ible.”  “B
ut what did Klyu
charëv do wrong
", Count?” aske"
d Pierre.  “
That is for me t
"o know, but not "
"for you to ask,�"
�� shouted Rosto
pchín.  “If
 he is accused o
f circulating Na
poleon’s procl
amation it is no
t proved that h
"e did so,” sai"
d Pierre without
 looking at Rost
"opchín, “and"
 Vereshchágin..
.”  “There
 we are!” Rost
opchín shouted 
at Pierre louder
" than before,
f"
rowning suddenly
. “Vereshchág
in is a renegade
 and a traitor w
ho will be puni
shed as he deser
"ves,” said he "
with the vindict
ive heat with wh
ich people spea
k when recalling
 an insult. “B
ut I did not sum
mon you to disc

but to give you 
advice—or an o

er it. I beg yo
u to leave the t
own and break of
f all communicat

en as Klyucharë
v. And I will kn
ock the nonsense
 out of anybody�
��—but probab
ly realizing tha
t he was shoutin
g at Bezúkhov w
ho so far was no
t guilty of any
"thing, he added,"
 taking Pierre�
�s hand in a fri
"endly manner,
�"
��We are on the 
eve of a public 
disaster and I h
aven’t time to
 be polite to e
verybody who has
 business with m
e. My head is so
metimes in a whi
"rl.
Well, mon c"
"her, what are yo"
u doing personal
ly?”  “Why
", nothing,” an"
swered Pierre wi
thout raising hi
s eyes or changi
ng the thoughtf
ul expression of
 his face.  Th
e count frowned.
  “A word of
 friendly advice
", mon cher. Be o"
ff as soon as yo
"u can, that’s"
 all I have to t
ell you. Happy h
e who has ears t
"o hear. Good-by,"
 my dear fellow
". Oh, by the by!"
” he shouted t
hrough the doorw
"ay after Pierre,"
 “is it true 
that the countes
s has fallen int
o the clutches o
f the holy fath
ers of the Socie
ty of Jesus?” 
  Pierre did no
t answer and lef
t Rostopchín’
s room more sull
en and angry th
an he had ever b
efore shown hims
elf.  When he 
reached home it 
was already gett
ing dark. Some e
ight people had 
 come to see him
 that evening: t
he secretary of 
"a committee, the"
 colonel of his
" battalion, his "
"steward, his maj"
"or-domo, and var"
ious petitioners
. They all had 
business with Pi
erre and wanted 
decisions from h
im. Pierre did 
not understand a
nd was not inter
ested in any of 
these questions 
and only answer
ed them in order
 to get rid of t
hese people. Whe
n left alone at
 last he opened 
and read his wif
e’s letter.  
"
“They, the so"
ldiers at the ba
"ttery, Prince An"
drew killed... t
hat old man... 
Simplicity is su
bmission to God.
 Suffering is ne
cessary... the 
meaning of all..
. one must harne
ss... my wife is
 getting married
... One must fo
rget and underst
and...” And go
ing to his bed h
e threw himself 
on it without u
ndressing and im
mediately fell a
sleep.  When h
e awoke next mor
ning the major-d
omo came to info
rm him that a s
pecial messenger
", a police offic"
"er, had come fro"
m Count Rostopch
ín to know whe
ther Count Bezú
khov had left or
 was leaving the
 town.  A doze
n persons who ha
d business with 
Pierre were awai
ting him in the 
 drawing room. P
ierre dressed hu
"rriedly and, ins"
tead of going to
" see
them, went"
 to the back por
ch and out throu
gh the gate.  
From that time t
ill the end of t
he destruction o
f Moscow no one 
of Bezúkhov’
"s household, des"
pite all the sea
"rch they made, s"
aw Pierre again 
 or knew where h
e was.     
 CHAPTER XII  
 The Rostóvs re
mained in Moscow
 till the first 
"of September, th"
"at is,
till the"
 eve of the enem
y’s entry into
 the city.  Af
ter Pétya had j
oined Obolénski
’s regiment of
 Cossacks and le
ft for Bélaya 
Tsérkov where t
hat regiment was
" forming, the co"
untess was seize
d with terror. 
The thought that
 both her sons w
"ere at the war, "
had both gone f
rom under her wi
"ng, that today o"
r tomorrow eithe
r or both of the
m might be kill
ed like the thre
e sons of one of
 her acquaintanc
"es, struck
her "
that summer for 
the first time w
ith cruel clearn
ess. She tried t
o get Nicholas 
back and wished 
to go herself to
" join Pétya, or"
 to get him an 
appointment some
where in Petersb
"urg, but neither"
 of these proved
 possible. Pét
ya could not ret
urn unless his r
egiment did so o
r unless he was
 transferred to 
another regiment
 on active servi
ce. Nicholas was
 somewhere with
 the army and ha
d not sent a wor
d since his last
" letter,
in whi"
ch he had given 
a detailed accou
nt of his meetin
g with Princess 
 Mary. The count
ess did not slee
"p at night, or w"
hen she did fall
 asleep dreamed
 that she saw he
r sons lying dea
d. After many co
nsultations and 
"
conversations, "
the count at las
t devised means 
to tranquillize 
her. He got Pé
tya transferred 
from Obolénski�
��s regiment to 
"Bezúkhov’s, w"
hich was in tra
ining near Mosco
w. Though Pétya
 would remain in
" the service, th"
is transfer wou
ld give the coun
tess the consola
tion of seeing a
t least one of 
her sons under h
"er wing, and she"
 hoped to arrang
e matters for he
r Pétya so as 
not to let him g
"o again, but alw"
ays get him appo
inted to places
 where he could 
not possibly tak
e part in a batt
le. As long as 
Nicholas alone w
as in danger the
 countess imagin
ed that she love
d her first-bor
n more than all 
her other childr
en and even repr
oached herself 
for it; but when
 her youngest: t
he scapegrace wh
o had been bad a
"t
lessons, was "
always breaking 
things in the ho
use and making h
imself a nuisan
"ce to everybody,"
 that snub-nosed
 Pétya with his
 merry black eye
s and fresh ros
y cheeks where s
oft down was jus
t beginning to s
how—when he w
as thrown amid t
"hose big, dreadf"
"ul, cruel men wh"
o were fighting 
 somewhere about
 something and a
pparently findin
g pleasure in it
—then his mot
her thought she 
"loved him more, "
"much more, than "
all her other c
hildren. The nea
rer the time cam
e for Pétya to 
"return, the more"
 uneasy grew th
e countess. She 
began to think s
he would never l
ive to see such 
 happiness. The 
presence of Són
"ya, of her belov"
"ed Natásha, or "
even of her hus
band irritated h
er. “What do I
 want with them?
 I want no one b
"ut
Pétya,” s"
he thought.  A
t the end of Aug
ust the Rostóvs
 received anothe
r letter from Ni
cholas. He wrot
e from the provi
nce of Vorónezh
 where he had be
en sent to procu
"re
remounts, bu"
t that letter di
d not set the co
untess at ease. 
Knowing that on
e son was out of
 danger she beca
me the more anxi
ous about Pétya
.  Though by t
he twentieth of 
August nearly al
l the Rostóvs�
� acquaintances 
 had left Moscow
", and though eve"
rybody tried to 
persuade the cou
ntess to get aw
ay as quickly as
" possible, she w"
ould not hear of
 leaving before 
"
her treasure, h"
er adored Pétya
", returned. On t"
he twenty-eighth
 of August he a
rrived. The pass
ionate tendernes
s with which his
 mother received
 him did not pl
ease the sixteen
-year-old office
r. Though she co
ncealed from hi
m her intention 
of keeping him u
"nder her wing, P"
étya guessed he
"r
designs, and "
instinctively fe
aring that he mi
ght give way to 
emotion when wi
th her—might �
��become womanis
h” as he terme
d it to himself�
��he treated he
"r coldly, avoide"
"d her, and durin"
g his stay in Mo
scow attached h
imself exclusive
ly to Natásha f
or whom he had a
lways had a part
icularly brothe
"rly tenderness, "
almost lover-lik
e.  Owing to t
he count’s cus
tomary carelessn
ess nothing was 
ready for their 
 departure by th
e twenty-eighth 
of August and th
e carts that wer
e to come from 
their Ryazán an
d Moscow estates
 to remove their
 household belo
ngings did not a
rrive till the t
hirtieth.  Fro
m the twenty-eig
hth till the thi
rty-first all Mo
scow was in a bu
stle and commot
ion. Every day t
housands of men 
wounded at Borod
inó were broug
ht in by the Dor
ogomílov gate a
nd taken to vari
ous parts of Mos
"cow,
and thousa"
nds of carts con
veyed the inhabi
tants and their 
possessions out
 by the other ga
tes. In spite of
 Rostopchín’s
" broadsheets, or"
 because of the
m or independent
"ly of them, the "
strangest and mo
st contradictory
 rumors were cu
rrent in the tow
n. Some said tha
t no one was to 
be allowed to l
"eave the city, o"
thers on the con
trary said that 
all the icons ha
d been taken ou
t of the churche
s and everybody 
was to be ordere
d to leave. Som
e said there had
 been another ba
ttle after Borod
inó at which th
e French had be
"en routed, while"
 others on the c
ontrary reported
 that the Russi
an army had been
 destroyed. Some
 talked about th
e Moscow militia
"
which, precede"
"d by the clergy,"
 would go to the
 Three Hills; ot
hers whispered 
that Augustin ha
d been forbidden
" to leave, that "
traitors had be
"en seized, that "
the peasants wer
e rioting and ro
bbing people on 
their way from 
"Moscow, and so o"
n. But all this 
was only talk; i
n reality (thou
gh the Council o
"f Filí, at whic"
h it was decided
 to abandon Mosc
"ow,
had not yet"
 been held) both
 those who went 
away and those w
ho remained beh
"ind felt, though"
 they did not sh
"ow it, that Mosc"
ow would certain
ly be abandoned
", and that they "
ought to get awa
y as quickly as 
possible and sa
ve their belongi
ngs. It was felt
 that everything
 would suddenly 
break up and ch
"ange, but up to "
the first of Sep
tember nothing h
ad done so. As 
a criminal who i
s being led to e
xecution knows t
hat he must die 
"
immediately, bu"
t yet looks abou
t him and straig
htens the cap th
at is awry on h
"is head, so Mosc"
ow involuntarily
 continued its w
"onted life,
tho"
ugh it knew that
 the time of its
 destruction was
 near when the 
conditions of li
fe to which its 
people were accu
stomed to submit
 would be compl
etely upset.  
During the three
 days preceding 
the occupation o
f Moscow the who
le Rostóv fami
ly was absorbed 
in various activ
ities. The head 
"of the
family, "
Count Ilyá Rost
"óv, continually"
 drove about the
 city collecting
 the current ru
mors from all si
des and gave sup
erficial and has
ty orders at ho
me about the pre
parations for th
eir departure. 
 The countess w
atched the thing
"s being packed, "
was dissatisfied
 with everythin
"g, was constantl"
y in pursuit of 
Pétya who was a
lways running a
"way from her, an"
d was jealous of
 Natásha with w
hom he spent all
 his time. Són
ya alone directe
d the practical 
side of matters 
by getting thin
gs packed. But o
f late Sónya ha
d been particula
rly sad and sile
nt. Nicholas’
 letter in which
 he mentioned Pr
incess Mary had 
"elicited, in
he"
"r presence, joyo"
us comments from
" the countess, w"
ho saw an interv
ention of Provi
dence in this me
eting of the pri
ncess and Nichol
as.  “I was 
never pleased at
 Bolkónski’s 
engagement to Na
"tásha,” said "
"the
countess, �"
��but I always w
anted Nicholas t
o marry the prin
"cess, and had a"
 presentiment th
at it would happ
en. What a good 
thing it would b
e!”  Sónya 
felt that this w
as true: that th
e only possibili
ty of retrieving
 the Rostóvs�
� affairs was by
 Nicholas marryi
"ng a rich woman,"
 and that the p
rincess was a go
od match. It was
 very bitter for
 her. But despit
"e
her grief, or"
 perhaps just be
"cause of it, she"
 took on herself
 all the diffic
ult work of dire
cting the storin
g and packing of
 their things an
d was busy for 
whole days. The 
count and counte
ss turned to her
 when they had 
any orders to gi
ve. Pétya and N
atásha on the c
"ontrary, far fro"
m helping their
" parents, were g"
enerally a nuisa
nce and a hindra
nce to everyone
. Almost all day
 long the house 
resounded with t
heir running fe
"et, their cries,"
 and their spont
aneous laughter.
 They laughed an
d were gay not 
because there wa
s any reason to 
"laugh, but becau"
se gaiety and m
irth were in the
ir hearts and so
 everything that
 happened was a 
cause for gaiet
y and laughter t
o them. Pétya w
as in high spiri
ts because havi
ng left home a b
oy he had return
ed (as everybody
 told him) a fin
"e
young man, be"
cause he was at 
"home, because he"
 had left Bélay
a Tsérkov wher
e there was no h
ope of soon taki
ng part in a bat
tle and had come
 to Moscow wher
e there was to b
e fighting in a 
"few days, and ch"
iefly because N
"atásha, whose l"
ead he always fo
"llowed, was in h"
igh spirits. Nat
ásha was gay b
ecause she had b
een sad too long
 and now nothing
 reminded her of
 the cause of h
"er sadness, and "
because she was 
feeling well. Sh
e was also happ
y because she ha
d someone to ado
re her: the ador
ation of others 
was a lubricant
 the wheels of h
er machine neede
d to make them r
un freely—and 
 Pétya adored h
"er. Above all, t"
hey were gay bec
ause there was a
 war near Mosco
"w, there would b"
e fighting at th
"e town gates, ar"
ms were being g
"iven out, everyb"
ody was escaping
—going away so
"mewhere, and in "
general somethi
ng extraordinary
" was happening, "
and that is alwa
"ys exciting,
es"
pecially to the 
young.     
 CHAPTER XIII 
"
On Saturday, t"
he thirty-first 
"of August, every"
thing in the Ros
tóvs’ house 
seemed topsy-tur
vy. All the door
"s were open, all"
 the furniture w
as being carrie
d out or moved a
"bout, and the mi"
rrors and pictur
es had been tak
en down. There w
ere trunks in th
"e rooms, and hay"
", wrapping paper"
", and
ropes wer"
e scattered abou
t. The peasants 
and house serfs 
carrying out th
e things were tr
eading heavily o
n the parquet fl
oors. The yard w
as crowded with
" peasant carts, "
some loaded high
 and already cor
"ded up,
others "
still empty.  
The voices and f
ootsteps of the 
many servants an
d of the peasant
s who had come 
with the carts r
esounded as they
 shouted to one 
another in the 
yard and in the 
house. The count
 had been out si
nce morning. The
 countess had a
 headache brough
t on by all the 
noise and turmoi
l and was lying
 down in the new
 sitting room wi
th a vinegar com
press on her hea
d. Pétya was n
"ot at home, he h"
ad gone to visit
 a friend with w
hom he meant to
 obtain a transf
er from the mili
tia to the activ
e army. Sónya w
as in the ballr
oom looking afte
r the packing of
 the glass and c
hina. Natásha 
was sitting on t
he floor of her 
dismantled room 
"with dresses, ri"
"bbons,
and scar"
ves strewn all a
"bout her, gazing"
 fixedly at the 
floor and holdi
ng in her hands 
the old ball dre
ss (already out 
of fashion) whic
h she had worn 
at her first Pet
ersburg ball.  
 Natásha was as
hamed of doing n
othing when ever
yone else was so
" busy, and
seve"
ral times that m
orning had tried
" to set to work,"
 but her heart w
"as
not in it, a"
nd she could not
 and did not kno
w how to do anyt
hing except wit
h all her heart 
and all her migh
t. For a while s
he had stood bes
ide Sónya whil
e the china was 
being packed and
" tried to help, "
but soon gave i
t up and went to
 her room to pac
k her own things
. At first she f
ound it amusing
 to give away dr
esses and ribbon
"s to the maids, "
but when that wa
s done and what
 was left had st
ill to be packed
", she found it d"
ull.  “Duny�
"�sha, you pack! "
"You will, won’"
"t you, dear?” "
And when Dunyás
ha willingly pr
omised to do it 
"all for her, Nat"
ásha sat down o
"n the floor,
to"
ok her old ball 
"dress, and fell "
into a reverie q
uite unrelated t
o what ought to
 have occupied h
er thoughts now.
 She was roused 
from her reverie
 by the talk of
 the maids in th
e next room (whi
ch was theirs) a
nd by the sound
 of their hurrie
d footsteps goin
g to the back po
rch. Natásha go
t up and looked
 out of the wind
ow. An enormousl
y long row of ca
rts full of wou
nded men had sto
pped in the stre
et.  The house
"keeper, the old "
"nurse, the cooks"
", coachmen, maid"
"s, footmen,
pos"
"tilions, and scu"
llions stood at 
"the gate, starin"
g at the wounded
".

Natásha, t"
hrowing a clean 
pocket handkerch
ief over her hai
r and holding a
n end of it in e
"ach hand, went o"
ut into the stre
et.  The forme
"r housekeeper, o"
ld Mávra Kuzmí
"nichna, had step"
ped out of the 
crowd by the gat
"e, gone up to a "
cart with a hood
 constructed of 
"bast
mats, and "
was speaking to 
a pale young off
icer who lay ins
ide. Natásha m
oved a few steps
 forward and sto
"pped shyly, stil"
l holding her h
"andkerchief, and"
 listened to wha
t the housekeepe
r was saying.  
 “Then you hav
e nobody in Mosc
ow?” she was s
aying. “You wo
uld be more com
fortable somewhe
re in a house...
" in ours, for in"
stance... the fa
mily are leavin
g.”  “I do
n’t know if it
 would be allowe
"d,” replied th"
e officer in a w
eak voice. “H
ere is our comma
nding officer...
" ask him,” and"
 he pointed to a
 stout major wh
o was walking ba
ck along the str
eet past the row
 of carts.  Na
tásha glanced w
ith frightened e
yes at the face 
of the wounded o
fficer and at o
nce went to meet
 the major.  �
��May the wounde
d men stay in ou
r house?” she 
asked.  The ma
jor raised his h
and to his cap w
ith a smile.  
“Which one do 
"you want, Ma’a"
m’selle?” sa
"id he, screwing "
up his eyes and 
 smiling.  Nat
ásha quietly re
peated her quest
"ion, and her fac"
e and whole man
ner were so seri
"ous, though she "
was still holdin
g the ends of he
"r
handkerchief,"
 that the major 
ceased smiling a
nd after some re
flection—as i
f considering in
 how far the thi
ng was possible�
��replied in the
 affirmative. 
"
“Oh yes, why"
" not? They may,�"
�� he said.  W
ith a slight inc
lination of her 
"head, Natásha s"
tepped back quic
kly to Mávra K
"uzmínichna, who"
 stood talking c
ompassionately t
o the officer. 
 “They may. H
e says they may!
” whispered Na
tásha.  The c
art in which the
 officer lay was
 turned into the
 Rostóvs’ yar
"d,
and dozens o"
f carts with wou
nded men began a
t the invitation
 of the townsfo
lk to turn into 
the yards and to
 draw up at the 
entrances of the
 houses in Pova
rskáya Street. 
Natásha was evi
dently pleased t
o be dealing wi
th new people ou
tside the ordina
ry routine of he
r life. She and 
Mávra Kuzmíni
chna tried to ge
t as many of the
 wounded as poss
ible into their 
 yard.  “You
r Papa must be t
"old, though,” "
said Mávra Kuzm
ínichna.  “
"Never mind, neve"
"r mind, what doe"
s it matter? For
 one day we can 
move into the d
rawing room. The
y can have all o
ur half of the h
ouse.”  “T
"here now, young "
"lady, you do tak"
e things into yo
ur head! Even if
 we put them in
"to the wing, the"
" men’s room, o"
r the nurse’s 
"room, we must as"
k permission.�
"�

“Well, I�"
��ll ask.”  
Natásha ran int
o the house and 
went on tiptoe t
hrough the half-
open door into 
the sitting room
", where there wa"
s a smell of vin
egar and Hoffman
’s drops.  
“Are you aslee
"p, Mamma?”

"
"“Oh, what slee"
p—?” said th
"e countess, waki"
ng up just as sh
e was dropping 
into a doze.  
“Mamma darling
!” said Natás
"ha, kneeling by "
her mother and b
ringing her fac
e close to her m
"other’s, “I "
"am sorry, forgiv"
"e me, I’ll nev"
er do it again;
 I woke you up! 
Mávra Kuzmínic
hna has sent me:
 they have broug
ht some wounded
 here—officers
. Will you let t
hem come? They h
ave nowhere to 
go. I knew you�
�d let them come
!” she said qu
ickly all in one
 breath.  “W
hat officers? Wh
om have they bro
ught? I don’t 
understand anyth
"ing
about it,�"
� said the count
ess.  Natásha
" laughed, and th"
e countess too s
miled slightly. 
  “I knew you
’d give permis
sion... so I’l
"l tell them,” "
"and, having kiss"
"ed
her mother, "
Natásha got up 
and went to the 
door.  In the 
hall she met her
" father, who had"
 returned with b
ad news.  “W
e’ve stayed to
o long!” said 
the count with i
nvoluntary vexat
ion. “The Clu
b is closed and 
the police are l
eaving.”  �
"�Papa, is it all"
 right—I’ve 
invited some of 
the wounded into
 the house?” 
said Natásha. 
 “Of course i
"t is,” he answ"
ered absently. �
��That’s not t
he point. I beg 
 you not to indu
lge in trifles n
"ow, but to help "
"to pack, and tom"
orrow we must g
"o, go, go!...”"
  And the coun
t gave a similar
 order to the ma
jor-domo and the
 servants.  At
 dinner Pétya h
aving returned h
ome told them th
e news he had he
ard. He said th
e people had bee
n getting arms i
"n the Krémlin, "
and that though 
 Rostopchín’s
 broadsheet had 
said that he wou
ld sound a call 
two or three da
"ys in advance, t"
he order had cer
tainly already b
een given for ev
eryone to go ar
med to the Three
" Hills tomorrow,"
 and that there 
would be a big 
battle there.  
 The countess lo
oked with timid 
horror at her so
"n’s eager, exc"
ited face as he
 said this. She 
realized that if
 she said a word
 about his not 
going to the bat
tle (she knew he
 enjoyed the tho
ught of the impe
nding engagemen
t) he would say 
something about 
"men, honor, and "
the fatherland�
��something sens
"eless, masculine"
", and obstinate "
which there wou
ld be no contrad
"icting, and her "
plans would be s
"poiled; and so,"
 hoping to arran
ge to leave befo
re then and take
 Pétya with her
 as their prote
ctor and defende
"r, she did not a"
"nswer him, but a"
fter dinner call
ed the count as
ide and implored
 him with tears 
to take her away
" quickly,
that "
very night if po
ssible. With a w
oman’s involun
tary loving cunn
"ing
she, who ti"
ll then had not 
"shown any alarm,"
 said that she w
ould die of fri
ght if they did 
not leave that v
ery night. Witho
ut any pretense 
she was now afr
aid of everythin
g.      CH
APTER XIV  Mad
"ame Schoss, who "
had been out to 
visit her daught
"er, increased th"
e countess’ f
ears still more 
by telling what 
she had seen at 
a spirit dealer
’s in Myasnít
ski Street. When
 returning by th
at street she ha
d been unable t
o pass because o
f a drunken crow
d rioting in fro
nt of the shop.
 She had taken a
 cab and driven 
home by a side s
treet and the c
abman had told h
er that the peop
le were breaking
 open the barrel
s at the drink 
"store, having re"
ceived orders to
 do so.  After
 dinner the whol
e Rostóv househ
old set to work 
with enthusiasti
c haste packing
 their belonging
s and preparing 
for their depart
ure. The old co
"unt, suddenly se"
"tting to work, k"
ept passing from
 the yard to the
 house and back
" again, shouting"
 confused instru
ctions to the hu
"rrying
people, "
and flurrying th
em still more. P
étya directed t
hings in the ya
"rd. Sónya, owin"
g to the count�
�s contradictory
" orders, lost he"
r head and did 
not know what to
 do. The servant
s ran noisily ab
out the house a
"nd yard, shoutin"
g and disputing.
" Natásha, with "
the ardor charac
teristic of all
 she did suddenl
y set to work to
o. At first her 
intervention in 
 the business of
 packing was rec
eived skepticall
y. Everybody exp
ected some pran
k from her and d
id not wish to o
bey her; but she
 resolutely and
 passionately de
manded obedience
", grew angry and"
 nearly cried be
cause they did 
"not heed her, an"
d at last succee
ded in making th
em believe her. 
 Her first explo
"it, which cost h"
er immense effor
t and establishe
d her authority
", was the packin"
g of the carpets
. The count had 
valuable Gobeli
n tapestries and
 Persian carpets
 in the house. W
hen Natásha set
 to work two ca
ses were standin
g open in the ba
"llroom, one almo"
st full up with
" crockery, the o"
ther with carpet
s. There was als
o much china st
anding on the ta
"bles, and still "
more was being b
rought in from t
he storeroom. A
 third case was 
needed and serva
nts had gone to 
fetch it.  “
"Sónya, wait a b"
it—we’ll pac
k everything int
"o these,” said"
 Natásha.  �
"�You can’t, Mi"
"ss, we have trie"
"d to,” said th"
e butler’s ass
istant.  “No
", wait a minute,"
 please.”  A
nd Natásha bega
n rapidly taking
 out of the case
 dishes and plat
es wrapped in p
aper.  “The 
dishes must go i
n here among the
" carpets,” sai"
d she.  “Why
", it’s a mercy"
 if we can get t
he carpets alone
 into three case
"s,”
said the "
butler’s assis
"tant.

“Oh, "
"wait, please!”"
 And Natásha be
gan rapidly and 
deftly sorting o
ut the things. 
“These aren’
"t needed,” sai"
"d she, putting a"
side some plates
 of Kiev ware. 
"“These—yes, "
these must go am
"ong the carpets,"
"” she said,
r"
eferring to the 
Saxony china dis
hes.  “Don�
"�t, Natásha! Le"
ave it alone! We
’ll get it all
" packed,” urge"
d Sónya reproa
chfully.  “W
hat a young lady
 she is!” rema
rked the major-d
omo.  But Nat�
�sha would not g
ive in. She turn
ed everything ou
t and began qui
"ckly repacking, "
deciding that th
e inferior Russi
an carpets and 
unnecessary croc
kery should not 
be taken at all.
 When everything
 had been taken
 out of the case
"s, they recommen"
"ced packing, and"
 it turned out 
that when the ch
eaper things not
 worth taking ha
d nearly all bee
"n
rejected, the"
 valuable ones r
eally did all go
 into the two ca
ses. Only the l
id of the case c
ontaining the ca
rpets would not 
shut down. A few
 more things mi
ght have been ta
"ken out, but Nat"
ásha insisted o
n having her ow
n way. She packe
"d, repacked, pre"
"ssed, made the b"
utler’s assist
ant and Pétya�
��whom she had d
rawn into the bu
siness of packin
g—press on the
"
lid, and made "
desperate effort
s herself.  �
�That’s enough
", Natásha,” s"
aid Sónya. “I
 see you were ri
"ght, but just
t"
ake out the top 
one.”  “I 
won’t!” crie
"d Natásha, with"
 one hand holdin
g back the hair 
that hung over 
her perspiring f
"ace, while with "
the other she pr
essed down the 
carpets. “Now 
"press, Pétya! P"
"ress, Vasílich,"
 press hard!” 
she cried.  Th
e carpets yielde
d and the lid cl
"osed; Natásha, "
clapping her han
"ds,
screamed wi"
th delight and t
ears fell from h
er eyes. But thi
s only lasted a
 moment. She at 
once set to work
 afresh and they
 now trusted her
 completely. Th
e count was not 
angry even when 
they told him th
at Natásha had
 countermanded a
"n order of his, "
and the servants
 now came to her
 to ask whether
 a cart was suff
"iciently loaded,"
 and whether it 
might be corded
 up. Thanks to N
atásha’s dire
ctions the work 
now went on exp
"editiously, unne"
cessary things w
"ere left, and th"
e most valuable 
 packed as compa
ctly as possible
.  But hard as
 they all worked
 till quite late
" that night, the"
y could not get
 everything pack
ed. The countess
 had fallen asle
ep and the count
",
having put of"
f their departur
e till next morn
"ing, went to bed"
.  Sónya and 
Natásha slept i
n the sitting ro
om without undre
ssing.  That n
ight another wou
nded man was dri
ven down the Pov
"arskáya, and M�"
�vra Kuzmínich
"na, who was stan"
ding at the gate
", had him brough"
t into the Rost
óvs’ yard. M�
�vra Kuzmínichn
a concluded that
 he was a very i
mportant man. H
e was being conv
eyed in a calèc
he with a raised
" hood, and was
"
quite covered by
 an apron. On th
e box beside the
 driver sat a ve
nerable old att
endant. A doctor
 and two soldier
s followed the c
arriage in a ca
rt.  “Please
 come in here. T
he masters are g
oing away and th
e whole house w
"ill be empty,”"
 said the old wo
man to the old a
ttendant.  “
"Well, perhaps,�"
� said he with a
 sigh. “We don
’t expect to g
et him home ali
ve! We have a ho
use of our own i
"n Moscow, but it"
’s a long way 
"from
here, and "
there’s nobody
 living in it.�
�  “Do us th
e honor to come 
"in, there’s pl"
enty of everythi
ng in the maste
r’s house. Com
"e in,” said M�"
�vra Kuzmínichn
a. “Is he very
 ill?” she as
ked.  The atte
ndant made a hop
eless gesture. 
 “We don’t 
expect to get hi
m home! We must 
ask the doctor.�
��  And the ol
d servant got do
wn from the box 
and went up to t
he cart.  “A
ll right!” sai
d the doctor.  
 The old servant
 returned to the
" calèche, looke"
"d into it, shook"
 his head disco
"nsolately, told "
the driver to tu
rn into the yard
", and stopped
b"
eside Mávra Kuz
mínichna.  �
"�O, Lord Jesus C"
hrist!” she mu

man into the hou

aid.  But they
 had to avoid ca
rrying the man u
"pstairs, and so "
they took him i
nto the wing and
 put him in the

 CHAPTER XV  
Moscow’s last 
day had come. It
 was a clear bri
"ght autumn day, "
a Sunday. The c
hurch bells ever
ywhere were ring
"ing for service,"
 just as usual o
n Sundays. Nobo
dy seemed yet to
 realize what aw
aited the city. 
  Only two thin
gs indicated the
 social conditio
n of Moscow—th
"e rabble,
that "
is the poor peop
"le, and the pric"
e of commodities
. An enormous cr
owd of factory 
"hands, house ser"
"fs, and peasants"
", with whom some"
" officials,
sem"
"inarists, and ge"
ntry were mingle
"d, had gone earl"
y that morning t
o the Three Hil
ls. Having waite
d there for Rost
opchín who did 
"not turn
up, th"
ey became convin
ced that Moscow 
would be surrend
"ered, and then
"
dispersed all ab
out the town to 
the public house
s and cookshops.
 Prices too tha
t day indicated 
the state of aff
airs. The price 
"of weapons, of
"
"gold, of carts a"
"nd horses, kept "
"rising, but the "
value of paper m
oney and city a
rticles kept fal
"ling, so that by"
 midday there we
re instances of 
 carters removin
g valuable goods
", such as cloth,"
 and receiving i
n payment a hal
f of what they c
"arted, while pea"
sant horses were
 fetching five 
hundred rubles e
"ach, and furnitu"
"re, mirrors, and"
 bronzes were be
ing given away 
for nothing.  
In the Rostóvs�
�� staid old-fas
hioned house the
 dissolution of 
former conditio
ns of life was b
ut little notice
able. As to the 
serfs the only 
indication was t
hat three out of
 their huge reti
nue disappeared 
 during the nigh
"t, but nothing w"
as stolen; and a
s to the value o
f their possess
"ions, the thirty"
 peasant carts t
hat had come in 
from their esta
tes and which ma
ny people envied
 proved to be ex
tremely valuable
 and they were 
offered enormous
 sums of money f
or them. Not onl
y were huge sum
s offered for th
e horses and car
"ts, but on the p"
revious evening 
and early in th
e morning of the
 first of Septem
"ber, orderlies a"
nd servants sen
t by wounded off
icers came to th
e Rostóvs’ an
d wounded men dr
agged themselve
s there from the
 Rostóvs’ and
 from neighborin
g houses where 
they were accomm
"odated, entreati"
ng the servants 
to try to get th
em a lift out o
f Moscow. The ma
jor-domo to whom
 these entreatie
s were addresse
"d, though he was"
 sorry for the w
"ounded, resolute"
"ly refused,
say"
ing that he dare
 not even mentio
n the matter to 
the count. Pity 
these wounded m
"en as one might,"
 it was evident 
that if they wer
e given one car
t there would be
 no reason to re
"fuse another, or"
 all the carts a
nd one’s own 
carriages as wel
l. Thirty carts 
could not save a
ll the wounded 
and in the gener
al catastrophe o
ne could not dis
regard oneself a
nd one’s own 
family. So thoug
ht the major-dom
o on his master�
��s behalf.  O
n waking up that
 morning Count I
lyá Rostóv lef
t his bedroom so
"ftly, so
as not"
 to wake the cou
ntess who had fa
llen asleep only
" toward morning,"
 and came out t
o the porch in h
is lilac silk dr
essing gown. In 
the yard stood 
the carts ready 
corded. The carr
iages were at th
e front porch. 
The major-domo s
tood at the porc
h talking to an 
elderly orderly 
and to a pale y
oung officer wit
h a bandaged arm
. On seeing the 
count the major
-domo made a sig
nificant and ste
rn gesture to th
em both to go aw
"ay.

“Well, "
"Vasílich, is ev"
erything ready?�
�� asked the cou
"nt, and stroking"
 his bald head 
he looked good-n
aturedly at the 
officer and the 
orderly and nod
ded to them. (He
 liked to see ne
w faces.)  “
We can harness a
"t once, your exc"
ellency.”  �
"��Well, that’s"
 right. As soon 
as the countess 
wakes we’ll be
" off, God
willi"
"ng! What is it, "
gentlemen?” he
" added, turning "
to the officer. 
“Are you stay
ing in my house?
”  The offic
er came nearer a
nd suddenly his 
face flushed cri
mson.  “Coun
"t, be so good as"
 to allow me... 
for God’s sake
", to get into so"
me corner of on
e of your carts!
 I have nothing 
here with me....
 I shall be all
 right on a load
ed cart....” 
 Before the off
icer had finishe
d speaking the o
rderly made the 
same request on
 behalf of his m
"aster.

“Oh,"
" yes, yes, yes!�"
�� said the coun
t hastily. “I 
shall be very pl
"eased,
very ple"
"ased. Vasílich,"
 you’ll see to
 it. Just unload
 one or two cart
"s.
Well, what o"
f it... do what�
��s necessary...
” said the cou
"nt, muttering
s"
ome indefinite o
rder.  But at 
the same moment 
an expression of
 warm gratitude 
on the officer�
�s face had alr
eady sealed the 
order. The count
 looked around h
im. In the yard
", at the gates, "
at the window of
" the wings, woun"
ded officers and
 their orderlie
s were to be see
n. They were all
 looking at the 
count and movin
g toward the por
ch.  “Please
 step into the g
"allery, your exc"
"ellency,” said"
 the major-domo.
 “What are yo
ur orders about 
the pictures?”
  The count we
nt into the hous
"e with him, repe"
ating his order 
not to refuse t
he wounded who a
sked for a lift.
"

“Well, nev"
"er mind, some of"
 the things can 
"be unloaded,” "
he added in a s
"oft, confidentia"
"l voice, as thou"
gh afraid of bei
ng overheard.  
 At nine o’clo
ck the countess 
"woke up, and Mat"
rëna Timoféevn
"a, who had
been"
 her lady’s ma
id before her ma
rriage and now p
erformed a sort 
of chief gendar
me’s duty for 
"her, came to say"
 that Madame Sch
oss was much of
fended and the y
oung ladies’ s
ummer dresses co
uld not be left 
behind. On inqu
"iry, the countes"
s learned that M
adame Schoss was
 offended becaus
e her trunk had
 been taken down
" from its cart, "
and all the load
s were being un
corded and the l
uggage taken out
 of the carts to
 make room for 
wounded men whom
 the count in th
e simplicity of 
his heart had or
dered that they
 should take wit
h them. The coun
tess sent for he
r husband.  �
"�What is this, m"
y dear? I hear t
hat the luggage 
is being unloade
d.”  “You 
"know, love, I wa"
nted to tell you
... Countess dea
r... an officer 
 came to me to a
sk for a few car
ts for the wound
"ed. After all, o"
urs are things 
that can be boug
ht but think wha
t being left beh
ind means to th
em!... Really no
"w, in our own ya"
rd—we asked th
em in ourselves 
and there are o
fficers among th
"em.... You know,"
" I think, my dea"
r... let them b
e taken... where
’s the hurry?�
��  The count 
"spoke timidly, a"
s he always did 
when talking of 
money matters. 
The countess was
 accustomed to t
his tone as a pr
ecursor of news 
of something de
trimental to the
 children’s in
"terests, such as"
 the building o
f a new gallery 
"or conservatory,"
 the inauguratio
n of a private t
heater or an or
chestra. She was
 accustomed alwa
ys to oppose any
thing announced 
 in that timid t
one and consider
ed it her duty t
o do so.  She 
assumed her dole
fully submissive
 manner and said
 to her husband:
 “Listen to m
"e, Count, you ha"
ve managed matte
rs so that we ar
e getting nothi
ng for the house
", and now you wi"
sh to throw away
 all our—all t
he children’s
 property! You s
aid yourself tha
t we have a hund
red thousand ru
bles’ worth of
 things in the h
ouse. I don’t 
"consent, my dear"
", I don’t!
Do"
 as you please! 
It’s the gover
nment’s busine
ss to look after
 the wounded; t
hey know that. L
ook at the Lopuk
"híns opposite, "
they cleared ou
t everything two
 days ago. That�
��s what other p
eople do. It’s
 only we who ar
e such fools. If
 you have no pit
"y on me, have so"
me for the chil
dren.”  Flou
rishing his arms
 in despair the 
count left the r
oom without rep
lying.  “Pap
"a, what are you "
doing that for?�
�� asked Natásh
"a, who had follo"
wed him into he
r mother’s roo
m.  “Nothing
! What business 
is it of yours?�
�� muttered the 
count angrily. 
 “But I heard
",” said Natás"
ha. “Why does 
Mamma object?”
  “What busi
ness is it of yo
urs?” cried th
e count.  Nat�
�sha stepped up 
to the window an
d pondered.  �
��Papa! Here’s
 Berg coming to 
"see us,” said "
"she, looking out"
 of the window.
      CHAP
"TER XVI

Berg,"
 the Rostóvs’
" son-in-law, was"
 already a colon
el wearing the o
rders of Vladí
"mir and Anna, an"
d he still fille
d the quiet and 
agreeable post 
of assistant to 
the head of the 
staff of the ass
istant commander
 of the first d
ivision of the S
econd Army.  O
n the first of S
eptember he had 
come to Moscow f
rom the army.  
 He had nothing 
"to do in Moscow,"
 but he had noti
ced that everyon
e in the army w
as asking for le
ave to visit Mos
cow and had some
thing to do ther
e. So he consid
ered it necessar
y to ask for lea
ve of absence fo
r family and do
mestic reasons. 
  Berg drove up
 to his father-i
n-law’s house 
in his spruce li
ttle trap with 
a pair of sleek 
"roans, exactly l"
ike those of a c
ertain prince. H
e looked attent
ively at the car
ts in the yard a
nd while going u
p to the porch 
took out a clean
 pocket handkerc
hief and tied a 
knot in it.  F
rom the anteroom
 Berg ran with s
mooth though imp
atient steps int
o the drawing r
"oom, where he em"
braced the count
", kissed the han"
ds of Natásha 
"and Sónya, and "
hastened to inqu
ire after “Mam
ma’s” health
".

“Health, "
at a time like t
his?” said the
" count. “Come,"
 tell us the new
s! Is the army 
retreating or wi
ll there be anot
her battle?” 
 “God Almight
y alone can deci
de the fate of o
"ur fatherland, P"
"apa,” said
Be"
rg. “The army 
is burning with 
a spirit of hero
ism and the lead
"ers, so
to say,"
 have now assemb
led in council. 
No one knows wha
t is coming. But
 in general I c
"an tell you, Pap"
"a, that such a h"
"eroic spirit, th"
e truly antique
 valor of the Ru
"ssian army, whic"
h they—which i
t” (he correct
ed himself) “
has shown or dis
played in the ba
ttle of the twen
ty-sixth—there
 are no words w
orthy to do it j
ustice! I tell y
"ou, Papa” (he "
smote himself o
n the breast as 
a general he had
 heard speaking 
"had done, but
B"
erg did it a tri
fle late for he 
should have stru
ck his breast at
 the words “R
"ussian army”),"
 “I tell you f
"rankly that we, "
"the commanders, "
far from having
 to urge the men
 on or anything 
"of that kind, co"
uld hardly rest
rain those... th
"ose... yes, thos"
e exploits of an
"tique valor,” "
he went on rapi
dly. “General 
Barclay de Tolly
 risked his life
 everywhere at 
the head of the 
"troops, I can as"
sure you. Our co
rps was statione
d on a hillside
. You can imagin
e!”  And Ber
g related all th
at he remembered
 of the various 
tales he had he
ard those days. 
Natásha watched
 him with an int
ent gaze that co
"nfused
him, as "
if she were tryi
ng to find in hi
s face the answe
r to some quest
ion.  “Altog
ether such heroi
sm as was displa
yed by the Russi
an warriors can
not be imagined 
or adequately pr
aised!” said B
"erg, glancing ro"
und at Natásha
", and as if anxi"
ous to conciliat
"e her, replying "
to her intent l
ook with a smile
. “‘Russia i
"s not in Moscow,"
 she lives in th
e hearts of her
 sons!’ Isn’
"t it so, Papa?�"
� said he.  Ju
st then the coun
tess came in fro
m the sitting ro
om with a weary 
and dissatisfie
d expression. Be
rg hurriedly jum
"ped up, kissed h"
"er hand,
asked "
about her health
", and, swaying h"
is head from sid
e to side to ex
"press sympathy, "
remained standin
g beside her.  
"
“Yes, Mamma, "
I tell you since
rely that these 
are hard and sad
 times for ever
y Russian. But w
hy are you so an
xious? You have 
still time to ge
t away....” 
 “I can’t t
hink what the se
rvants are about
",” said the co"
"untess, turning"
 to her husband.
 “I have just 
been told that n
othing is ready 
yet. Somebody a
fter all must se
e to things. One
 misses Mítenka
 at such times. 
 There won’t b
e any end to it.
”  The count
 was about to sa
"y something, but"
 evidently restr
ained himself. 
He got up from h
is chair and wen
t to the door. 
 At that moment
 Berg drew out h
is handkerchief 
as if to blow hi
"s nose
and, see"
ing the knot in 
"it, pondered, sh"
aking his head s
adly and signif
icantly.  “A
nd I have a grea
t favor to ask o
"f you, Papa,” "
said he.  “H
m...” said the
" count, and stop"
ped.  “I was
 driving past Yu
súpov’s house
" just now,” sa"
id Berg with a l
"augh,
“when t"
"he steward, a ma"
"n I know, ran ou"
t and asked me w
hether I wouldn�
��t buy somethi
ng. I went in ou
"t of curiosity, "
"you know, and th"
ere is a small 
chiffonier and a
 dressing table.
 You know how de
ar Véra wanted 
a chiffonier li
ke that and how 
we had a dispute
 about it.” (A
t the mention o
f the chiffonier
 and dressing ta
ble Berg involun
tarily changed h
is tone to one 
of pleasure at h
is admirable dom
estic arrangemen
ts.) “And it�
�s such a beaut
y! It pulls out 
and has a secret
" English drawer,"
 you know! And 
dear Véra has l
ong wanted one. 
I wish to give h
"er a surprise, y"
ou see. I saw s
o many of those 
peasant carts in
 your yard. Plea
se let me have 
"one, I will pay "
"the man well, an"
d...”  The c
ount frowned and
 coughed.  “
Ask the countess
", I don’t give"
 orders.”  �
��If it’s inco
"nvenient, please"
" don’t,” sai"
d Berg. “Only 
"I so wanted it,"
 for dear Véra�

"“Oh, go to the"
" devil, all of y"
ou! To the devil
", the devil, the"
 devil...” cr
ied the old coun
t. “My head’
s in a whirl!”
  And he left 
the room. The co
untess began to 
"cry.

“Yes, "
"Mamma! Yes, thes"
e are very hard 
times!” said B
erg.  Natásha
 left the room w
ith her father a
"nd, as if findin"
g it difficult t

llowed him and t
hen ran downstai

engaged in givin

 Moscow. The loa

 the yard. Two 
of them had been
 uncorded and a 
wounded officer 
was climbing in
to one of them h
elped by an orde
rly.  “Do yo
u know what it�
�s about?” Pé
tya asked Natás
ha.  She under
stood that he me

Pétya, �"
��I consider it 
"so horrid, so ab"

I don’t know w

”  Her throa
t quivered with 
convulsive sobs 
"and, afraid of w"
eakening and le
tting the force 
of her anger run
" to waste, she t"
urned and rushed
 headlong up th
e stairs.  Ber
g was sitting be
side the countes
s consoling her 
with the respect
ful attention o
f a relative. Th
"e count, pipe in"
" hand, was pacin"

"tásha, her face"
 distorted by an

ke a tempest an
d approached her
 mother with rap
id steps.  “
It’s horrid! I
t’s abominable
!” she screame
d. “You can’
t possibly have 
 ordered it!” 
  Berg and the 
countess looked 
"at her, perplexe"
d and frightened
. The count sto
od still at the 
window and liste
ned.  “Mamma
", it’s impossi"
ble: see what is
 going on in the

ied. “They wi

�  “What’s

"
“Why, the wo"

 It’s monstrou

 not the thing. 
Please forgive m

"amma, what

 it matter what 
we take away? On
ly look what is 
going on in the 
 yard... Mamma!.
.. It’s imposs
ible!”  The 
count stood by t
he window and li
stened without t
urning round. S
uddenly he sniff
ed and put his f
ace closer to th
e window.  The
 countess glance
d at her daughte
"r, saw her face "
full of shame fo
"r her
mother, s"
aw her agitation
", and understood"
 why her husband
 did not turn t
o look at her no
"w, and she glanc"
ed round quite d
isconcerted.  
"“Oh, do as you"
 like! Am I hind
ering anyone?”
" she said, not s"
urrendering at 
once.  “Mamm
"a, darling, forg"

t the countess p
ushed her daught

 up to her husba

"she, dropping he"

d the count thro

ed his wife who 
was glad to hide
 her look of sh

t.  “Papa! M
amma! May I see 
to it? May I?...
” asked Natás
ha. “We will s
till take all t
he most necessar
y things.”  
The count nodded
" affirmatively, "
"and Natásha, at"
 the rapid pace 
at which she us
ed to run when p
"laying at tag, r"
an through the b
allroom to the 
anteroom and dow
nstairs into the
 yard.  The se
rvants gathered 
"round Natásha, "
but could not be
lieve the strang
e order she bro
ught them until 
the count himsel
"f, in his wife�"
"�s name,
confir"
med the order to
 give up all the
 carts to the wo
unded and take t
he trunks to th
e storerooms. Wh
en they understo
od that order th
e servants set 
to work at this 
new task with pl
easure and zeal.
 It no longer se
emed strange to
 them but on the
 contrary it see
med the only thi
ng that could b
"e done, just as "
a quarter of an 
hour before it h
ad not seemed st
range to anyone
 that the wounde
d should be left
 behind and the 
goods carted aw
ay but that had 
seemed the only 
thing to do.  
The whole househ
"old, as if to at"
one for not havi
ng done it soone
"r, set
eagerly "
to work at the n
ew task of placi
ng the wounded i
n the carts. The
 wounded dragge
d themselves out
 of their rooms 
and stood with p
ale but happy f
aces round the c
arts. The news t
hat carts were t
o be had spread 
 to the neighbor
"ing houses, from"
 which wounded m
en began to come
 into the Rost�
�vs’ yard. Man
y of the wounded
 asked them not 
to unload the ca
rts but only to
 let them sit on
 the top of the 
things. But the 
work of unloadi
"ng, once started"
", could not be a"
rrested. It seem
ed not to matter
 whether all or
 only half the t
hings were left 
behind. Cases fu
"ll of
china, br"
"onzes, pictures,"
 and mirrors tha
t had been so ca
refully packed 
the night before
 now lay about t
"he yard, and sti"
ll they went on 
 searching for a
nd finding possi
bilities of unlo
ading this or th
at and letting 
the wounded have
 another and yet
 another cart. 
 “We can take
" four more men,�"
�� said the stew
ard. “They can
" have my trap,
"
or else what is 
to become of the
m?”  “Let 
them have my war
"drobe cart,” s"
aid the countess
. “Dunyásha c
an go with me i
n the carriage.�
��  They unloa
ded the wardrobe
 cart and sent i
t to take wounde
d men from a ho
use two doors of
f. The whole hou
"sehold, servants"
" included, was b"
right and anima
ted. Natásha wa
s in a state of 
rapturous excite
ment such as she
 had not known 
for a long time.
  “What coul
d we fasten this
 onto?” asked 
"the servants, tr"
ying to fix a t
runk on the narr
ow footboard beh
ind a carriage. 
“We must keep 
at least one ca
rt.”  “Wha
t’s in it?” 
asked Natásha. 
  “The count�
��s books.”  
"
“Leave it, Va"
sílich will put
 it away. It’s
 not wanted.” 
  The phaeton w
as full of peopl
e and there was 
a doubt as to wh
ere Count Peter
 could sit.  �
��On the box. Yo
u’ll sit on th
"e box, won’t y"
"ou, Pétya?” c"
ried Natásha. 
 Sónya too was
 busy all this t
"ime, but the aim"
 of her efforts 
was quite diffe
rent from Natás
ha’s. She was 
putting away the
 things that had
 to be left beh
ind and making a
 list of them as
 the countess wi

 CHAPTER XVII  
 Before two o’
clock in the aft
ernoon the Rost�
�vs’ four carr
"iages, packed
f"
ull and with the
 horses harnesse
"d, stood at the "
front door. One 
by one the cart
s with the wound
ed had moved out
 of the yard.  
 The calèche in
 which Prince An
drew was being t
aken attracted S
ónya’s atten
tion as it passe
d the front porc
h. With the help
 of a maid she w
as arranging a 
seat for the cou
ntess in the hug
e high coach tha
t stood at the 
entrance.  “
Whose calèche i
s that?” she i
"nquired, leaning"
 out of the carr
iage window.  
"
“Why, didn’"
"t you know, Miss"
?” replied the
 maid. “The wo
unded prince: he
 spent the nigh
t in our house a
nd is going with
 us.”  “Bu
t who is it? Wha
t’s his name?�
��  “It’s 
our intended tha
t was—Prince B
olkónski himsel
f! They say he i
"s
dying,” rep"
lied the maid wi
th a sigh.  S�
�nya jumped out 
of the coach and
 ran to the coun
tess. The counte
"ss,
tired out a"
nd already dress
ed in shawl and 
bonnet for her j
"ourney,
was pac"
ing up and down 
the drawing room
", waiting for th"
e household to 
assemble for the
 usual silent pr
ayer with closed
 doors before st
arting. Natásh
a was not in the
 room.  “Mam
"ma,” said Són"
"ya, “Prince An"
"drew is here, mo"
rtally wounded. 
He is going wit
h us.”  The 
countess opened 
her eyes in dism
"ay and, seizing "
"Sónya’s arm, "
glanced around.
  “Natásha?
” she murmured
.  At that mom
ent this news ha
d only one signi
ficance for both
 of them. They 
knew their Natá
"sha, and alarm a"
s to what would 
happen if she he
ard this news s
tifled all sympa
thy for the man 
they both liked.
  “Natásha 
does not know ye
"t, but he is goi"
"ng with us,” s"
aid Sónya.  �
��You say he is 
dying?”  Só
nya nodded.  T
he countess put 
her arms around 
Sónya and began
 to cry.  “T
he ways of God a
re past finding 
out!” she thou
"ght, feeling tha"
t the Almighty 
"Hand, hitherto u"
"nseen, was becom"
ing manifest in 
all that was no
w taking place. 
"

“Well, Mamm"
a? Everything is
 ready. What’s
 the matter?” 
"asked Natásha, "
as with animate
d face she ran i
nto the room.  
"
“Nothing,” "
answered the cou
ntess. “If eve
rything is ready
 let us start.�
�  And the cou
ntess bent over 
her reticule to 
hide her agitate
d face. Sónya 
embraced Natásh
a and kissed her
.  Natásha lo
oked at her inqu
iringly.  “W
hat is it? What 
has happened?”
  “Nothing..
. No...”  �
�Is it something
 very bad for me
? What is it?”
 persisted Natá
sha with her qu
ick intuition. 
 Sónya sighed 
and made no repl
"y. The count, P�"
"�tya, Madame Sch"
"oss, Mávra
Kuz"
"mínichna, and V"
asílich came in
to the drawing r
"oom and, having "
closed the door
"s, they all sat "
down and remaine
d for some momen
ts silently sea
ted without look
ing at one anoth
er.  The count
 was the first t
"o rise, and with"
 a loud sigh cro
ssed himself be
fore the icon. A
ll the others di
d the same. Then
 the count embra
ced Mávra Kuzm
ínichna and Vas
"ílich, who were"
 to remain in Mo
"scow, and while"
 they caught at 
his hand and kis
sed his shoulder
 he patted their
 backs lightly 
with some vaguel
y affectionate a
nd comforting wo
rds. The counte
ss went into the
 oratory and the
re Sónya found 
her on her knees
 before the ico
ns that had been
 left here and t
here hanging on 
the wall. (The 
most precious on
"es, with which s"
ome family tradi
tion was connect
"ed,
were being "
taken with them.
)  In the porc
h and in the yar
d the men whom P
étya had armed 
with swords and
" daggers, with t"
rousers tucked i
nside their high
 boots and with 
belts and girdl
"es tightened, we"
re taking leave 
of those remaini
ng behind.  As
 is always the c
ase at a departu
"re, much had bee"
n forgotten or p
ut in the wrong
" place, and for "
a long time two 
menservants stoo
d one on each s
ide of the open 
door and the car
riage steps wait
ing to help the 
"
countess in, wh"
ile maids rushed
 with cushions a
nd bundles from 
the house to th
"e carriages, the"
" calèche, the p"
"haeton, and back"
 again.  “Th
ey always will f
orget everything
!” said the co
untess. “Don�
�t you know I c
an’t sit like 
that?”  And 
"Dunyásha, with "
"clenched teeth, "
without replying
 but with an ag
grieved look on 
"her face, hastil"
y got into the c
oach to rearrang
e the seat.  
"“Oh, those ser"
vants!” said t
"he count, swayin"
g his head.  E
"fím, the old co"
"achman, who was "
the only one the
 countess truste
"d to
drive her,"
 sat perched up 
high on the box 
and did not so m
uch as glance r
ound at what was
 going on behind
 him. From thirt
y years’ exper
ience he knew i
t would be some 
time yet before 
"the order, “Be"
" off, in God’s"
 name!” would
 be given him: a
nd he knew that 
even when it was
 said he would 
be stopped once 
or twice more wh
ile they sent ba
ck to fetch som
ething that had 
"been forgotten, "
and even after t
hat he would aga
in be stopped a
nd the countess 
herself would le
an out of the wi
ndow and beg hi
m for the love o
f heaven to driv
e carefully down
 the hill. He kn
ew all this and
 therefore waite
d calmly for wha
"t would happen, "
with more patie
nce than the hor
"ses, especially "
"the near one, th"
e chestnut Falco
"n,
who was pawi"
ng the ground an
d champing his b
it. At last all 
"were
seated, th"
e carriage steps
 were folded and
" pulled up, the "
"door was shut,
"
somebody was sen
t for a travelin
"g case, and the "
countess leaned 
out and said wh
at she had to sa
y. Then Efím de
liberately doffe
d his hat and b
egan crossing hi
mself. The posti
lion and all the
 other servants 
did the same. �
"��Off, in God’"
s name!” said 
"Efím, putting o"
n his hat. “St
art!” The pos
tilion started t
"he horses, the o"
ff pole horse tu
gged at his coll
"ar,
the high sp"
"rings creaked, a"
nd the body of t
he coach swayed.
 The footman sp
rang onto the bo
x of the moving 
coach which jolt
ed as it passed 
out of the yard
 onto the uneven
 roadway; the ot
her vehicles jol
ted in their tu
"rn, and the proc"
ession of carria
ges moved up the
 street. In the 
"
carriages, the "
"calèche, and th"
"e phaeton, all c"
rossed themselve
s as they passe
d the church opp
osite the house.
 Those who were 
to remain in Mos
cow walked on e
ither side of th
e vehicles seein
g the travelers 
off.  Rarely h
ad Natásha expe
rienced so joyfu
l a feeling as n
"ow, sitting in
"
the carriage bes
ide the countess
 and gazing at t
he slowly recedi
ng walls of for
"saken, agitated "
Moscow. Occasion
ally she leaned 
out of the carr
iage window and 
looked back and 
then forward at 
the long train o
f wounded in fr
ont of them. Alm
ost at the head 
of the line she 
could see the r
aised hood of Pr
ince Andrew’s 
calèche. She di
d not know who w
"as
in it, but e"
ach time she loo
ked at the proce
ssion her eyes s
ought that cal�
�che. She knew i
t was right in f
ront.  In Kúd
"rino, from the N"
"ikítski, Présn"
"ya, and Podnoví"
nsk Streets came
 several other 
trains of vehicl
es similar to th
"e Rostóvs’, a"
nd as they pass
ed along the Sad
óvaya Street th
e carriages and 
carts formed two
 rows abreast. 
  As they were 
going round the 
Súkharev water 
"tower Natásha, "
who was inquisi
tively and alert
ly scrutinizing 
the people drivi
ng or walking p
"ast, suddenly cr"
ied out in joyfu
l surprise:  �
��Dear me! Mamma
", Sónya, look, "
it’s he!”  
 “Who? Who?”
  “Look! Yes
", on my word, it"
’s Bezúkhov!�
�� said Natásha
", putting her he"
ad out of the c
arriage and star
"ing at a tall, s"
tout man in a co
achman’s long
" coat, who from "
his manner of wa
lking and moving
 was evidently 
a gentleman in d
"isguise, and who"
 was passing und
er the arch of t
he Súkharev to
wer accompanied 
"by a small, sall"
"ow-faced, beardl"
ess old man in 
a frieze coat. 
"
“Yes, it rea"
lly is Bezúkhov
 in a coachman�
"�s coat, with a "
queer-looking o
"ld boy. Really,�"
�� said Natásha
", “look, look!"
"”

“No, it"
’s not he. How
 can you talk su
ch nonsense?” 
"

“Mamma,” "
screamed Natásh
"a, “I’ll sta"
ke my head it’
s he! I assure y
"ou!
Stop, stop!"
” she cried to
 the coachman. 
 But the coachm
an could not sto
"p, for from the "
Meshchánski Str
eet came more c
arts and carriag
"es, and the Rost"
óvs were being 
shouted at to mo
ve on and not b
lock the way.  
"
In fact, howeve"
"r, though now mu"
ch farther off t
"han before, the "
Rostóvs all sa
w Pierre—or so
meone extraordin
arily like him�
�in a coachman�
"�s coat,
going "
down the street 
with head bent a
nd a serious fac
e beside a small
",
beardless old"
 man who looked 
like a footman. 
That old man not
iced a face thr
ust out of the c
arriage window g
"azing at them, a"
nd respectfully 
 touching Pierre
’s elbow said 
something to him
 and pointed to 
the carriage. P
"ierre, evidently"
 engrossed in th
"ought, could not"
 at first under
stand him. At le
ngth when he had
 understood and 
looked in the d
irection the old
" man indicated, "
he recognized Na
"tásha, and foll"
owing his first
 impulse stepped
 instantly and r
apidly toward th
e coach. But ha
ving taken a doz
en steps he seem
ed to remember s
omething and sto
pped.  Natásh
"a’s face, lean"
ing out of the w
"indow, beamed wi"
th quizzical ki
ndliness.  “
Peter Kirílovic
"h, come here! We"
 have recognized
 you! This is w
onderful!” she
" cried, holding "
out her hand to 
him. “What are
 you doing? Why
 are you like th
is?”  Pierre
 took her outstr
etched hand and 
kissed it awkwar
dly as he walked
 along beside h
er while the coa
ch still moved o
n.  “What is
" the matter, Cou"
nt?” asked the
 countess in a s
urprised and co
mmiserating tone
.  “What? Wh
at? Why? Don’t
" ask me,” said"
" Pierre, and loo"
ked round at Na
tásha whose rad
"iant, happy expr"
ession—of whic
h he was conscio
us without look

led him with enc
hantment.  “
Are you remainin

n?”  Pierre 
hesitated.  �
�In Moscow?” h
e said in a ques
tioning tone. �
"�Yes, in Moscow."
 Good-by!”  
"“Ah, if only I"
 were a man! I�
�d certainly sta
y with you. How 
splendid!” sa
id Natásha. “
"Mamma, if you’"
"ll let me, I’l"
l stay!”  Pi
erre glanced abs
ently at Natásh
a and was about 
to say something
", but
the count"
ess interrupted 
him.  “You w

"

“Yes, I was"
",” Pierre answ"
ered. “There w
ill be another b
attle tomorrow.
"..” he began, "
but Natásha int
errupted him.  
 “But what is 
the matter with 
"you, Count? You "
are not like you

"“Oh, don’t a"
"sk me, don’t a"
sk me! I don’t

"o! Good-by, good"

red. “It’s a

 and dropping b

ge he stepped on
to the pavement.
  Natásha con
tinued to lean o

 for a long time

HAPTER XVIII  
For the last two
" days, ever sinc"
"e leaving home, "
Pierre had been 
living in the e
mpty house of hi
s deceased benef
"actor, Bazdéev."
 This is how it 
 happened.  Wh
en he woke up on
 the morning aft
er his return to
 Moscow and his 
 interview with 
Count Rostopchí
"n, he could not "
for some time ma
ke out where he
 was and what wa
s expected of hi
m. When he was i
nformed that am
ong others await
ing him in his r
eception room th
ere was a French
man who had bro
ught a letter fr
"om his wife, the"
 Countess Hélè
"ne, he felt
sud"
denly overcome b
y that sense of 
confusion and ho
pelessness to wh
ich he was apt 
to succumb. He f
elt that everyth
ing was now at a
"n end, all
was "
in confusion and
 crumbling to pi
"eces, that nobod"
y was right or 
"wrong, the futur"
"e held nothing, "
and there was no
 escape from thi
s position. Smi
ling unnaturally
 and muttering t
"o himself, he fi"
rst sat down on
 the sofa in an 
attitude of desp
"air, then rose, "
went to the door
 of the recepti
on room and peep
ed through the c
"rack, returned f"
lourishing his 
"arms, and took u"
p a book. His ma
jor-domo came in
 a second time t
o say that the 
Frenchman who ha
d brought the le
tter from the co
untess was very
 anxious to see 
him if only for 
"a minute, and th"
at someone from 
 Bazdéev’s wi
dow had called t
o ask Pierre to 
take charge of h
er husband’s 
"books, as she he"
rself was leavin
g for the countr
"y.

“Oh, yes"
", in a minute; w"
ait... or no! No
", of course... g"
o and say I will
"
come directly,"
” Pierre repli
ed to the major-
domo.  But as 
soon as the man 
had left the roo
m Pierre took up
 his hat which 
was lying on the
 table and went 
out of his study
 by the other do
or. There was n
o one in the pas
sage. He went al
ong the whole le
ngth of this pa
ssage to the sta
"irs and, frownin"
g and rubbing hi
s forehead with 
"
both hands, wen"
t down as far as
 the first landi
ng. The hall por
ter was standin
g at the front d
oor. From the la
nding where Pier
re stood there 
was a second sta
ircase leading t
o the back entra
nce. He went dow
n that staircas
e and out into t
he yard. No one 
had seen him. Bu
t there were so
me carriages wai
"ting, and as soo"
n as Pierre step
ped out of the g
ate the coachme
n and the yard p
orter noticed hi
m and raised the
ir caps to him.
 When he felt he
 was being looke
d at he behaved 
like an ostrich 
 which hides its
 head in a bush 
in order not to 
be seen: he hung
 his head and q
uickening his pa
ce went down the
 street.  Of a
ll the affairs a
waiting Pierre t
hat day the sort
ing of Joseph B
azdéev’s book
s and papers app
eared to him the
 most necessary.
  He hired the
 first cab he me
t and told the d
river to go to t
he Patriarch’
"s Ponds, where t"
he widow Bazdée
v’s house was.
  Continually 
turning round to
 look at the row
s of loaded cart
s that were mak
ing their way fr
om all sides out
" of Moscow, and "
balancing his bu
lky body so as 
not to slip out 
of the ramshackl
"e old vehicle, P"
"ierre,
experien"
cing the joyful 
feeling of a boy
 escaping from s
"chool, began to"
 talk to his dri
ver.  The man 
told him that ar
ms were being di
stributed today 
at the Krémlin 
 and that tomorr
ow everyone woul
d be sent out be
yond the Three H
ills gates and 
a great battle w
ould be fought t
here.  Having 
reached the Patr
iarch’s Ponds 
Pierre found the
 Bazdéevs’ ho
"use,
where he h"
ad not been for 
a long time past
. He went up to 
the gate. Gerá
"sim, that sallow"
 beardless old m
an Pierre had se
en at Torzhók f
ive years befor
e with Joseph Ba
"zdéev, came out"
 in answer to hi
s knock.  “A
t home?” asked
 Pierre.  “O
wing to the pres
ent state of thi
ngs Sophia Daní
lovna has gone t
o the Torzhók 
estate with the 
"children, your e"
xcellency.”  
 “I will come 
"in all the same,"
 I have to look 
through the book
"s,” said
Pier"
re.  “Be so 
good as to step 
in. Makár Alex�
"�evich, the brot"
her of my late 
master—may the
 kingdom of heav
en be his—has 
"remained here, b"
ut he is in a w
eak state as you
" know,” said t"
he old servant. 
  Pierre knew t
hat Makár Alex�
�evich was Josep
h Bazdéev’s h
alf-insane brot
her and a hard d
rinker.  “Ye
"s, yes, I know. "
Let us go in...�
�� said Pierre a
nd entered the h
"ouse.

A tall,"
 bald-headed old
 man with a red 
"nose, wearing a "
dressing gown an
d with galoshes
 on his bare fee
"t, stood in the "
anteroom. On see
ing Pierre he m
uttered somethin
g angrily and we
nt away along th
e passage.  �
�He was a very c
lever man but ha
s now grown quit
"e feeble, as you"
"r honor
sees,�"
� said Gerásim.
 “Will you ste
p into the study
?” Pierre nodd
ed. “As it wa
s sealed up so i
"t has remained, "
but Sophia Daní
lovna gave order
s that if anyon
e should come fr
om you they were
 to have the boo
ks.”  Pierre
 went into that 
gloomy study whi
ch he had entere
d with such tre
pidation in his 
benefactor’s l
ifetime. The roo
"m, dusty and unt"
ouched since th
e death of Josep
h Bazdéev was n
ow even gloomier
.  Gerásim op
ened one of the 
shutters and lef
t the room on ti
ptoe. Pierre we
nt round the stu
"dy, approached t"
he cupboard in w
hich the manuscr
"ipts
were kept,"
 and took out wh
at had once been
 one of the most
" important,
the"
 holy of holies 
of the order. Th
is was the authe
ntic Scotch Acts
 with Bazdéev�
��s notes and ex
planations. He s
at down at the d
usty writing ta
"ble, and, having"
 laid the manusc
ripts before him
", opened them ou"
"t,
closed them,"
 finally pushed 
"them away, and r"
esting his head 
on his hand san
k into meditatio
n.  Gerásim l
ooked cautiously
 into the study 
several times an
d saw Pierre al
ways sitting in 
the same attitud
e.  More than 
two hours passed
 and Gerásim to
ok the liberty o
f making a slig
ht noise at the 
door to attract 
"his attention, b"
ut Pierre did no
t hear him.  
“Is the cabman
 to be discharge
"d, your honor?�"
�  “Oh yes!�
"�� said Pierre, "
rousing himself 
and rising hurri
edly. “Look h
"ere,” he added"
", taking Gerási"
m by a button of
 his coat and lo
oking down at t
he old man with 
"moist, shining, "
and ecstatic eye
"s, “I say, do "
you know that t
here is going to
 be a battle tom
orrow?”  “
"We heard so,” "
replied the man.
  “I beg you
 not to tell any
"one who I am, an"
d to do what I a
sk you.”  �
"�Yes, your excel"
"lency,” replie"
d Gerásim. “W
ill you have som
ething to eat?�
"��

“No, but"
 I want somethin
g else. I want p
easant clothes a
"nd a pistol,”"
"
said Pierre, un"
expectedly blush
"ing.

“Yes, "
"your excellency,"
” said Gerási
m after thinking
 for a moment. 
 All the rest o
f that day Pierr
e spent alone in
 his benefactor�
"��s study,
and "
Gerásim heard h
im pacing restle
ssly from one co
rner to another 
and talking to 
himself. And he 
spent the night 
on a bed made up
 for him there.
"

Gerásim, be"
ing a servant wh
o in his time ha
d seen many stra
"nge things,
acc"
epted Pierre’s
 taking up his r
esidence in the 
house without su
"rprise,
and see"
med pleased to h
ave someone to w
ait on. That sam
e evening—with
out even asking
 himself what th
ey were wanted f
or—he procured
 a coachman’s 
 coat and cap fo
"r Pierre, and pr"
omised to get hi
m the pistol nex
t day. Makár A
lexéevich came 
twice that eveni
ng shuffling alo
ng in his galosh
es as far as th
e door and stopp
ed and looked in
gratiatingly at 
Pierre. But as 
soon as Pierre t
urned toward him
 he wrapped his 
dressing gown ar
ound him with a
 shamefaced and 
angry look and h
urried away. It 
was when Pierre
 (wearing the co
achman’s coat 
which Gerásim h
ad procured for 
him and had dis
infected by stea
m) was on his wa
y with the old m
an to buy the p
istol at the Sú
kharev market th
at he met the Ro
stóvs.     
  CHAPTER XIX 
 Kutúzov’s o
rder to retreat 
through Moscow t

t night on the f

troops started a

 of them masses 
of soldiers cro
wding and hurryi
ng across the br

on the opposite 
side and blocki

"nd alleys, while"
 endless masses 
of troops were 
bearing down on 
them from behind
", and an unreaso"
ning hurry and a
larm overcame t
hem. They all ru
shed forward to 
"the bridge, onto"

to the"
 fords and the b
oats. Kutúzov h
imself had drive

"
Napoleon was sta

troops on the Po

 before him. Fro

extraordinary au

"as a surprise, w"
hen the sun hang

more heat than 
"in spring, when "
everything shine
s so brightly in
 the rare clear 
 atmosphere that
" the eyes smart,"
 when the lungs 
are strengthened
 and refreshed 
by inhaling the 
aromatic autumn 
"air, when even t"
he nights are w
"arm, and when in"
 those dark warm
" nights, golden "
stars startle an
d delight us co
ntinually by fal
ling from the sk

the morning of t
he second of Sep
tember this weat
her still held.
  The brightne
ss of the mornin
g was magical. M
oscow seen from 
the Poklónny H
ill lay spacious
ly spread out wi
"th her river, he"
"r gardens, and h"
"er
churches, an"
d she seemed to 
be living her us
"ual life, her cu"
polas glitterin
g like stars in 
the sunlight.  
 The view of the
 strange city wi
th its peculiar 
"architecture, su"
ch as he had ne
"ver seen before,"
 filled Napoleon
 with the rather
 envious and un
easy curiosity m
en feel when the
y see an alien f
orm of life that
 has no knowled
ge of them. This
 city was eviden
tly living with 
the full force 
of its own life.
 By the indefini
"te signs which, "
even at a distan
"ce,
distinguish"
 a living body f
"rom a dead one, "
Napoleon from th
e Poklónny Hil
l perceived the 
throb of life in
 the town and fe
"lt, as it were, "
the breathing o
f that great and
 beautiful body.
  Every Russia
n looking at Mos
cow feels her to
 be a mother; ev
ery foreigner w
"ho sees her, eve"
n if ignorant of
 her significanc
e as the mother
" city, must feel"
 her feminine ch
"aracter, and Nap"
oleon felt it. 
 “Cette ville
 asiatique aux i
nnombrables égl
"ises, Moscou la "
sainte. La voil
"à donc enfin, c"
ette fameuse vil
le! Il était te
"mps,” * said h"
"e, and

to be spread out

 summoned Lelor

That Asiatic cit
y of the innumer

oly      Moscow
! Here it is the
"n at last, that "
famous city. It 
was      high t

A town captured 
by the enemy is 
like a maid who 
has lost her hon
"or,”
thought "
he (he had said 
so to Túchkov a
t Smolénsk). Fr
om that point of
 view he gazed 
at the Oriental 
beauty he had no

t seemed strang
e to him that hi
s long-felt wish

 had at last be
en realized. In

 now at the cit
y and now at the

and the assuranc

 awed him.  �
�But could it be
 otherwise?” h
e thought. “He

 In what light

"t he, thinking o"
f his troops. �
"��Here she is, t"
he reward for al

"reflected,
glan"
cing at those ne
ar him and at th
e troops who wer
e approaching an

��One word from 
"me, one movement"
" of my hand, and"
 that ancient c
apital of the Ts
ars would perish
. But my clemenc
y is always read
y to descend up
on the vanquishe

nanimous and tru
ly great. But n
"o, it can’t be"
 true that I am

 suddenly though
t. “Yet here

On the ancient

 just this which
 Alexander will 
 feel most painf

.” (It seemed 
to Napoleon that
 the chief impo
rt of what was t
aking place lay 
in the personal 
struggle between
 himself and Al
exander.) “Fro

the Krémlin—y

  “Qu’on m�
��amène les boy

e to his suite. 
      * “Brin
g the boyars to 
me.”   A ge
neral with a bri
lliant suite gal
loped off at onc
e to fetch the 
boyars.  Two h
ours passed. Nap
oleon had lunche
d and was again 
standing in the 
 same place on t
he Poklónny Hil
l awaiting the d
eputation. His s
peech to the bo
yars had already
 taken definite 
shape in his ima
gination. That 
speech was full 
of dignity and g
reatness as Napo
leon understood 
it.  He was hi
mself carried aw
ay by the tone o
f magnanimity he
 intended to ad
opt toward Mosco
w. In his imagin
ation he appoint
ed days for asse
mblies at the p
alace of the Tsa
"rs, at which Rus"
sian notables an
d his own would 
 mingle. He ment
ally appointed a
" governor, one w"
ho would win the
 hearts of the 
people. Having l
earned that ther
e were many char
itable institut
ions in Moscow h
e mentally decid
ed that he would
 shower favors 
on them all. He 
"thought that, as"
 in Africa he ha
d to put on a bu
rnoose and sit 
"in a mosque, so "
in Moscow he mus
t be beneficent 
like the Tsars. 
 And in order fi
nally to touch t
he hearts of the
 Russians—and 
being like all 
Frenchmen unable
 to imagine anyt
hing sentimental
 without a refer
ence to ma chè
"re, ma tendre, m"
a pauvre mère *
 —he decided t
hat he would pl
ace an inscripti
on on all these 
establishments i
n large letters:
 “This establ
ishment is dedic
ated to my dear 
mother.” Or no
", it should
be "
simply: Maison d
"e ma Mère, *(2)"
 he concluded. �
��But am I reall
y in Moscow? Ye
"s, here it lies "
"before me, but w"
hy is the deputa
tion from the c
ity so long in a
ppearing?” he 
wondered.     
"  * “My dear, "
"my tender, my po"
or mother.”  
      * (2) “H
ouse of my Mothe
r.”   Meanw
hile an agitated
 consultation wa
s being carried 
on in whispers 
among his genera
ls and marshals 
at the rear of h
is suite. Those 
sent to fetch t
he deputation ha
d returned with 
the news that Mo
"scow was empty,"
 that everyone h
ad left it. The 
faces of those w
ho were not conf
erring together
 were pale and p
erturbed. They w
ere not alarmed 
by the fact tha
t Moscow had bee
n abandoned by i
ts inhabitants (
grave as that fa
"ct
seemed), but"
 by the question
 how to tell the
 Emperor—witho
ut putting him 
in the terrible 
position of appe
aring ridiculous
—that he had b
een awaiting th
e boyars so long
 in vain: that t
here were drunke
n mobs left in 
Moscow but no on
e else. Some sai
d that a deputat
ion of some sort
 must be scrape
"d together, othe"
rs disputed that
 opinion and mai
ntained that th
e Emperor should
 first be carefu
lly and skillful
"ly prepared, and"
 then told the 
truth.  “He 
will have to be 
"told, all the sa"
"me,” said some"
 gentlemen of th
e suite. “But
", gentlemen...�"
�  The positio
n was the more a
wkward because t
"he Emperor, medi"
tating upon his
 magnanimous pla
"ns, was pacing p"
atiently up and 
down before the 
"
outspread map, "
occasionally gla
ncing along the 
road to Moscow f
rom under his l
ifted hand with 
a bright and pro
ud smile.  “
But it’s impos
sible...” decl
ared the gentlem
"en of the suite,"
 shrugging thei
r shoulders but 
not venturing to
 utter the impli
ed word—le ri
dicule....  At
 last the Empero
"r, tired of futi"
"le expectation, "
his actor’s in
stinct suggesti
ng to him that t
he sublime momen
t having been to
o long drawn out
 was beginning 
to lose its subl
"imity, gave a si"
gn with his hand
. A single repo
rt of a signalin
"g gun followed, "
"and the troops, "
who were already
 spread out on 
different sides 
"of Moscow, moved"
 into the city t
hrough the Tver
", Kalúga, and D"
orogomílov gate
s. Faster and fa
"ster, vying with"
"
one another, t"
hey moved at the
 double or at a 
"trot, vanishing "
amid the clouds
 of dust they ra
ised and making 
the air ring wit
h a deafening ro
ar of mingling 
shouts.  Drawn
 on by the movem
ent of his troop
s Napoleon rode 
with them as far
 as the Dorogom
"ílov gate, but "
there again stop
"ped and, dismoun"
ting from his h
"orse, paced for "
a long time by t
he Kámmer-Koll�
"�zski rampart, a"
waiting the dep
utation.    
  CHAPTER XX 
 Meanwhile Mosc
ow was empty. Th
ere were still p
"eople in it, per"
haps a fiftieth
 part of its for
mer inhabitants 
"had remained, bu"
t it was empty. 
 It was empty in
 the sense that 
a dying queenles
s hive is empty.
  In a queenle
ss hive no life 
is left though t
o a superficial 
glance it seems
 as much alive a
s other hives. 
 The bees circl
e round a queenl
ess hive in the 
hot beams of the
 midday sun as 
gaily as around 
the living hives
; from a distanc
e it smells of 
honey like the o
"thers, and bees "
fly in and out i
n the same way. 
But one has onl
y to observe tha
t hive to realiz
e that there is 
no longer any l
ife in it. The b
ees do not fly i
"n the same way, "
the smell and th
e sound that me
et the beekeeper
 are not the sam
e. To the beekee
per’s tap on t
he wall of the 
"sick hive, inste"
ad of the former
 instant unanimo
us humming of t
ens of thousands
 of bees with th
eir abdomens thr
eateningly comp
"ressed, and prod"
ucing by the rap
id vibration of 
their wings an 
aerial living so
"und, the only re"
ply is a disconn
ected buzzing fr
om different pa
rts of the deser
ted hive. From t
he alighting boa
"rd, instead
of "
the former spiri
tuous fragrant s
mell of honey an
"d venom, and the"
 warm whiffs of
" crowded life, c"
omes an odor of 
emptiness and de
cay mingling wi
th the smell of 
honey. There are
 no longer senti
nels sounding th
e alarm with th
eir abdomens rai
"sed, and ready t"
o die in defense
 of the hive. T
here is no longe
r the measured q
uiet sound of th
robbing activity
",
like the soun"
d of boiling wat
"er, but diverse "
discordant sound
s of disorder. 
In and out of th
e hive long blac
k robber bees sm
eared with hone
y fly timidly an
d shiftily. They
" do not sting, b"
ut crawl away fr
om danger. Form
erly only bees l
aden with honey 
flew into the hi
"ve, and they
fl"
ew out empty; no
w they fly out l
aden. The beekee
per opens the lo
wer part of the
 hive and peers 
in. Instead of b
"lack, glossy bee"
s—tamed by to
"il, clinging to "
one another’s 
legs and drawing
" out the wax, wi"
th a ceaseless 
hum of labor—t
hat used to hang
 in long cluster
s down to the f
loor of the hive
", drowsy shrivel"
ed bees crawl ab
out separately i
n various direc
tions on the flo
or and walls of 
the hive. Instea
d of a neatly g
"lued floor, swep"
t by the bees wi
th the fanning o
"f their wings,
"
there is a floor
 littered with b
"its of wax, excr"
"ement, dying bee"
s scarcely movi
"ng their legs, a"
nd dead ones tha
t have not been 
cleared away. 
 The beekeeper 
opens the upper 
part of the hive
 and examines th
e super. Instea
d of serried row
s of bees sealin
g up every gap i
n the combs and 
 keeping the bro
"od warm, he sees"
 the skillful co
mplex structures
" of the
combs, "
but no longer in
 their former st
ate of purity. A
ll is neglected 
 and foul. Black
 robber bees are
 swiftly and ste
althily prowling
 about the comb
"s, and the short"
" home bees, shri"
veled and listle
ss as if they w
"ere old, creep s"
lowly about with
out trying to hi
nder the robbers
",
having lost a"
ll motive and al
l sense of life.
" Drones, bumbleb"
"ees, wasps,
and"
 butterflies kno
ck awkwardly aga
inst the walls o
f the hive in th
eir flight. Her
e and there amon
g the cells cont
aining dead broo
d and honey an 
angry buzzing ca
n sometimes be h
eard. Here and t
here a couple of
"
bees, by force"
 of habit and cu
stom cleaning ou
t the brood cell
"s, with
efforts"
 beyond their st
rength laborious
ly drag away a d
ead bee or bumb
lebee without kn
owing why they d
o it. In another
 corner two old 
bees are langui
"dly fighting, or"
 cleaning themse
"lves, or feeding"
" one another,
w"
ithout themselve
s knowing whethe
r they do it wit
h friendly or ho
stile intent. I
n a third place 
"a crowd of bees,"
 crushing one an
"other, attack
s"
ome victim and f
ight and smother
" it, and the vic"
"tim, enfeebled o"
"r
killed, drops"
 from above slow
ly and lightly a
"s a feather, amo"
ng the heap of 
corpses. The kee
per opens the tw
o center partiti
ons to examine 
the brood cells.
 In place of the
 former close da
rk circles forme
d by thousands 
of bees sitting 
back to back and
 guarding the hi
gh mystery of g
"eneration, he se"
es hundreds of d
"ull, listless, a"
nd sleepy shells
 of bees. They 
have almost all 
"died unawares, s"
itting in the sa
nctuary they ha
d guarded and wh
ich is now no mo
re. They reek of
 decay and death
. Only a few of
 them still move
", rise, and feeb"
ly fly to settle
 on the enemy’
"s
hand, lacking"
 the spirit to d
ie stinging him;
 the rest are de
ad and fall as 
lightly as fish 
scales. The beek
eeper closes the
" hive, chalks a "
"mark
on it, and"
 when he has tim
e tears out its 
contents and bur
ns it clean.  
So in the same w
ay Moscow was em
pty when Napoleo
"n, weary, uneasy"
", and
morose, p"
aced up and down
 in front of the
 Kámmer-Kolléz
"ski rampart,
aw"
aiting what to h
is mind was a ne
"cessary, if but "
"formal, observan"
ce of the propr
ieties—a deput
ation.  In var
ious corners of 
Moscow there sti
ll remained a fe
w people aimless
ly moving about
", following thei"
r old habits and
 hardly aware of
 what they were
 doing.  When 
with due circums
pection Napoleon
 was informed th
at Moscow was e
"mpty, he looked "
angrily at his i
"nformant, turned"
" away, and silen"
tly continued t
o walk to and fr
o.  “My carr
iage!” he said
.  He took his
 seat beside the
 aide-de-camp on
 duty and drove 
into the suburb
. “Moscow dese
rted!” he said
 to himself. “
What an incredib
le event!”  
 He did not driv
"e into the town,"
 but put up at a
n inn in the Dor
ogomílov subur
b.  The coup d
e théâtre had 
not come off.  
     CHAPTER
 XXI  The Russ
ian troops were 
passing through 
Moscow from two 
o’clock at nig
ht till two in 
the afternoon an

 past the church
 of Vasíli the
 Beatified and u
nder the Boroví

up the hill to 
the Red Square w
here some instin
ct told them the
y could easily t
ake things not

 the Bazaar. But
 there were no

forms and overco

"ut
muskets, ent"
ering the Bazaar
 empty-handed an
d silently makin
g their way out
 through its pas
sages with bundl
es. Tradesmen an
d their assistan
ts (of whom the
re were but few)
 moved about amo
ng the soldiers 
quite bewildere
d. They unlocked
 their shops and
 locked them up 
"again, and
them"
selves carried g
oods away with t
he help of their
 assistants. On 
the square in f
ront of the Baza
ar were drummers
 beating the mus

he roll of the d
rums did not mak

is uniform and m
ounted on a lean
", dark-gray hors"
"e,
the other in"
 an overcoat and
" on foot, stood "
at the corner of
 Ilyínka Stree
"t, talking. A th"
ird officer gall
oped up to them.
  “The gener
al orders them a
ll to be driven 
"out at once, wit"
hout fail. This
 is outrageous! 
Half the men hav
e dispersed.” 
  “Where are 
you off to?... W
here?...” he s
houted to three 
infantrymen wit
hout muskets who
", holding up the"
 skirts of their
" overcoats, were"
 slipping past 
him into the Baz

"Stop, you rascal"
s!”  “But 
how are you goin

�� replied anoth
er officer. “T

"Come, go in ther"
e and drive them
 out!” shouted
 the senior offi
cer.  The offi

" dismounted, cal"
led up a drummer

 him into the ar

�  Several sho

“Eh, wh"

 “Come inside

 repeated the tr

  The officer 
stood perplexed 
and his face sho

  “It’s not

" he exclaimed, a"

 the passages. 
  From one open
 shop came the s
ound of blows an

and just as the
 officer came up
 to it a man in 
a gray coat with
 a shaven head w

ficer ran out in
to the square. 
 “What is it?
 What is it?” 
"he asked, but hi"
s comrade was al
ready galloping
 off past Vasíl
i the Beatified 
in the direction
 from which the 
 screams came. 
 The officer mo
unted his horse 
and rode after h
im. When he reac
hed the bridge 
he saw two unlim
"bered guns, the "
infantry crossin
"g the bridge,
s"
everal overturne
"d carts, and fri"
ghtened and laug
hing faces among
 the troops. Be
side the cannon 
a cart was stand
ing to which two
 horses were ha
rnessed. Four bo
rzois with colla
rs were pressing
 close to the wh
eels. The cart 
"was loaded high,"
 and at the very
" top, beside a c"
hild’s chair 
with its legs in
" the air, sat a "
peasant woman ut
tering piercing 
and desperate s
hrieks. He was t
old by his fello
w officers that 
the screams of 
the crowd and th
e shrieks of the
 woman were due 
to the fact that
 General Ermól
"ov, coming up to"
 the crowd and l
earning that sol
diers were disp
ersing among the
 shops while cro
wds of civilians
 blocked the bri
"dge,
had ordere"
d two guns to be
 unlimbered and 
made a show of f
iring at the br
"idge. The crowd,"
 crushing one an
"other, upsetting"
" carts, and shou"
ting and squeez
"ing desperately,"
 had cleared off
 the bridge and 
the troops were
 now moving forw
ard.      
CHAPTER XXII  
"Meanwhile, the c"
ity itself was d
eserted. There w
as hardly anyone
 in the streets
. The gates and 
shops were all c
"losed, only here"
 and there round
 the taverns so
litary shouts or
 drunken songs c
ould be heard. N
obody drove thr
ough the streets
 and footsteps w
ere rarely heard
. The Povarská
ya was quite sti
ll and deserted.
 The huge courty
ard of the Rost
óvs’ house wa
s littered with 
wisps of hay and
 with dung from 
"the
horses, and"
 not a soul was 
to be seen there
. In the great d
rawing room of 
"the house, which"
 had been left w
ith all it conta
"ined, were
two "
people. They wer
e the yard porte
"r Ignát, and th"
e page boy Mísh
"ka,
Vasílich�"
�s grandson who 
had stayed in Mo
scow with his gr
andfather. Mís
hka had opened t
he clavichord an
d was strumming 
on it with one 
finger. The yard
" porter, his arm"
"s akimbo, stood "
smiling with sa
tisfaction befor
e the large mirr
or.  “Isn’
"t it fine, eh, U"
ncle Ignát?” 
"said the boy, su"
ddenly beginning
 to strike the 
keyboard with bo
th hands.  “
Only fancy!” a
"nswered Ignát, "
surprised at the
 broadening grin
 on his face in
 the mirror.  
“Impudence! Im
pudence!” they
 heard behind th
em the voice of 
Mávra Kuzmíni
chna who had ent
ered silently. �
��How he’s gri
"nning, the fat m"
ug! Is that wha
t you’re here 
for? Nothing’s
 cleared away do
wn there and Va
sílich is worn 
out. Just you wa
it a bit!”  
Ignát left off 
"smiling, adjuste"
"d his belt, and "
went out of the 
room with meekl
y downcast eyes.
"

“Aunt, I d"
"id it gently,”"
 said the boy. 
 “I’ll give
 you something g
"ently, you monke"
y you!” cried 
Mávra Kuzmíni
"chna, raising he"
r arm threatenin
gly. “Go and g
et the samovar t
o boil for your
 grandfather.”
  Mávra Kuzm�
�nichna flicked 
the dust off the
 clavichord and 
"closed it, and
"
with a deep sigh
 left the drawin
g room and locke
d its main door.
  Going out in
to the yard she 
paused to consid
er where she sho
uld go next—t
o drink tea in t
he servants’ w
ing with Vasíli
"ch, or into the"
 storeroom to pu
t away what stil
l lay about.  
She heard the so
und of quick foo
tsteps in the qu
iet street. Some
one stopped at 
"the gate, and th"
e latch rattled 
as someone tried
 to open it. M�
�vra Kuzmínichn
a went to the ga
te.  “Who do
 you want?”  
 “The count—
Count Ilyá Andr
éevich Rostóv.
”  “And wh
o are you?”  
"
“An officer, "
I have to see hi
"m,” came the r"
eply in a pleasa
"nt, well-bred
R"
ussian voice.  
 Mávra Kuzmíni
chna opened the 
gate and an offi
"cer of eighteen,"
 with the round
 face of a Rost�
"�v, entered the "
yard.  “They
" have gone away,"
 sir. Went away 
yesterday at ves
"pertime,” said"
 Mávra Kuzmín
ichna cordially.
  The young of
ficer standing i
"n the gateway, a"
s if hesitating 
whether to ente
"r or not, clicke"
d his tongue.  
"
“Ah, how anno"
ying!” he mutt
ered. “I shoul
d have come yest
"erday.... Ah,
w"
hat a pity.” 
"
Meanwhile, Má"
vra Kuzmínichna
 was attentively
 and sympathetic
ally examining 
the familiar Ros
tóv features of
 the young man�
"�s face, his
ta"
ttered coat and 
trodden-down boo
ts.  “What d
id you want to s
ee the count for
?” she asked. 
  “Oh well...
 it can’t be h
elped!” said h
e in a tone of v
exation and pla
ced his hand on 
the gate as if t
o leave.  He a
gain paused in i
ndecision.  �
"�You see,” he "
"suddenly said, �"
��I am a kinsman
 of the count’
s and he has be
en very kind to 
me. As you see�
� (he glanced wi
th an amused air
 and good-natur
ed smile at his 
coat and boots) 
“my things are
 worn out and I 
"
have no money, "
so I was going t
o ask the count.
..”  Mávra 
Kuzmínichna did
 not let him fin
ish.  “Just 
"wait a minute, s"
ir. One little m
"oment,” said s"
he.  And as so
on as the office
r let go of the 
gate handle she 
"turned and,
hur"
rying away on he

 through the bac
k yard to the s
ervants’ quart

�vra Kuzmínichn
a was running to
 her room the of
ficer walked abo
ut the yard gaz
ing at his worn-
out boots with l
owered head and 
a faint smile o
n his lips. “W
hat a pity I’v

What a nice old

? And how am I t
o find the neare
st way to overt
"ake my regiment,"
 which must by n

ght he. Just the

corner of the ho

tened yet resolu
"te look, carryin"
g a rolled-up c
heck kerchief in
 her hand. While
 still a few ste
ps from the off
icer she unfolde
d the kerchief a
nd took out of i
t a white twent
y-five-ruble ass
ignat and hastil
y handed it to h
im.  “If his
 excellency had 
"been at home, as"
 a kinsman he wo
uld of course...
 but as it is..
.”  Mávra K
uzmínichna grew
 abashed and con
fused. The offic
er did not decl
"ine, but took th"
e note quietly a
nd thanked her. 
  “If the cou
nt had been at h

 Kuzmínichna we
nt on apologeti
cally. “Christ
" be with you, si"
r! May God prese
rve you!” said
"
she, bowing as"
 she saw him out
.  Swaying his
 head and smilin
g as if amused a
"t himself, the o"
fficer ran almo
st at a trot thr
ough the deserte
d streets toward
 the Yaúza brid
ge to overtake 
his regiment.  
 But Mávra Kuzm
ínichna stood a
t the closed gat
e for some time 
with moist eyes
", pensively sway"
ing her head and
 feeling an unex
pected flow of 
motherly tendern
ess and pity for
 the unknown you

    CHAPTER X
XIII  From an 
unfinished house
 on the Varvárk
"a, the ground fl"
oor of which was
"
a dramshop, ca"
me drunken shout
s and songs. On 
benches round th
e tables in a d
irty little room
 sat some ten fa
ctory hands. Tip
sy and perspirin
"g,
with dim eye"
s and wide-open 
"mouths, they wer"
e all laboriousl
y singing some 
song or other. T
hey were singing
" discordantly, a"
"rduously, and wi"
th great effort
", evidently not "
because they wis
"hed to sing, but"
 because they w
anted to show th
ey were drunk an
d on a spree. On
"e, a tall,
fair"
-haired lad in a
 clean blue coat
", was standing o"
ver the others. 
His face with i
ts fine straight
 nose would have
 been handsome h
ad it not been 
"for his thin, co"
"mpressed, twitch"
ing lips and dul
"l, gloomy, fixed"
 eyes. Evidentl
y possessed by s
"ome idea, he sto"
od over those wh
"o were
singing,"
 and solemnly an
d jerkily flouri
shed above their
 heads his white
 arm with the s
leeve turned up 
"to the elbow, tr"
ying unnaturally
 to spread out 
his dirty finger
s. The sleeve of
 his coat kept s
lipping down and
 he always care
fully rolled it 
up again with hi
"s left hand, as "
if it were most
 important that 
the sinewy white
 arm he was flou
rishing should b
e bare. In the 
midst of the son
g cries were hea
"rd, and fighting"
 and blows in t
he passage and p
orch. The tall l
ad waved his arm
.  “Stop it!
” he exclaimed
 peremptorily. �
��There’s a fi
"ght, lads!” An"
"d,
still rollin"
"g up his sleeve,"
 he went out to 
the porch.  Th
e factory hands 
followed him. Th
"ese men, who und"
er the leadershi
p of the tall l
ad were drinking
 in the dramshop
" that morning, h"
ad brought the 
publican some sk
ins from the fac
tory and for thi
s had had drink 
served them. Th
e blacksmiths fr
om a neighboring
" smithy, hearing"
 the sounds of 
revelry in the t
avern and suppos
ing it to have b
"een broken into,"
 wished to forc
e their way in t
oo and a fight i
n the porch had 
resulted.  The
 publican was fi
ghting one of th
e smiths at the 
"door, and when t"
he workmen came
" out the smith, "
wrenching himsel
f free from the 
"tavern
keeper, "
fell face downwa
rd on the paveme
nt.  Another s
mith tried to en
"ter the doorway,"
 pressing agains
t the publican 
with his chest. 
  The lad with 
the turned-up sl
eeve gave the sm
ith a blow in th
e face and crie
d wildly: “The
y’re fighting 
"us, lads!”

"
At that moment t
he first smith g
"ot up and, scrat"
ching his bruise
d face to make 
"it bleed, shoute"
d in a tearful v
oice: “Police!
 Murder!... The
y’ve killed a 
"man, lads!”
"
"
“Oh, gracious"
" me, a man beate"
n to death—kil
led!...” screa
med a woman com
ing out of a gat
e close by.  A
 crowd gathered 
round the bloods
tained smith.  
 “Haven’t yo
u robbed people 
enough—taking 
their last shirt
s?” said a vo
ice addressing t
he publican. “
What have you ki
"lled a man for, "
you thief?” 
"
The tall lad, "
standing in the 
"porch, turned hi"
s bleared eyes f
rom the publica
n to the smith a
nd back again as
 if considering 
whom he ought to
 fight now.  
“Murderer!” 
he shouted sudde
nly to the publi
can. “Bind him
", lads!”

�"
�I daresay you w
ould like to bin
d me!” shouted
" the publican, p"
ushing away the
 men advancing o
"n him, and snatc"
hing his cap fro
m his head he f
lung it on the g
round.  As if 
this action had 
some mysterious 
and menacing sig
"nificance, the
"
workmen surround
ing the publican
 paused in indec
ision.  “I k
now the law very
" well, mates! I�"
��ll take the ma
tter to the capt
ain of police. 
You think I won�
��t get to him? 
Robbery is not p
ermitted to any
body nowadays!�
� shouted the pu
"blican, picking "
up his cap.  �
��Come along the
n! Come along th
en!” the publi
can and the tall
 young fellow r
epeated one afte
"r the other, and"
 they moved up t
he street toget
her.  The bloo
dstained smith w
ent beside them.
 The factory han
ds and others f
"ollowed behind, "
talking and shou
ting.  At the 
corner of the Mo
"roséyka, opposi"
te a large house
 with closed sh
utters and beari
ng a bootmaker�
"�s signboard, st"
ood a score of t
"hin,
worn-out, "
gloomy-faced boo
"tmakers, wearing"
 overalls and lo
ng tattered coa
ts.  “He sho
uld pay folks of
"f properly,” a"
 thin workingman
", with frowning"
 brows and a str
"aggly beard, was"
 saying.  “B
ut he’s sucked
 our blood and n
ow he thinks he�
��s quit of us. 
He’s been mis
leading us all t
he week and now 
that he’s brou
ght us to this p
ass he’s made
 off.”  On s
eeing the crowd 
and the bloodsta
ined man the wor
kman ceased spe
"aking, and with "
eager curiosity 
all the bootmake
rs joined the mo
ving crowd.  
“Where are all
 the folks going
"?”

“Why, "
"to the police, o"
f course!”  
"“I say, is it "
true that we hav
e been beaten?�
� “And what di
d you think? Lo
ok what folks ar
e saying.”  
Questions and an
swers were heard
". The publican, "
taking advantage
 of the increas
"ed crowd, droppe"
d behind and ret
urned to his tav
ern.  The tall
" youth, not noti"
cing the disappe
arance of his fo
"e, waved his
ba"
re arm and went 
on talking inces
"santly, attracti"
ng general atten
tion to himself
. It was around 
him that the peo
ple chiefly crow
"ded, expecting
"
answers from him
 to the question
s that occupied 
all their minds.
  “He must k
"eep order, keep "
"the law, that’"
s what the gover
nment is there 
for. Am I not ri
"ght, good Christ"
ians?” said th
"e tall youth, wi"
th a scarcely p
erceptible smile
. “He thinks t
here’s no gove
rnment! How can 
 one do without 
government? Or e
lse there would 
be plenty who’
d rob us.”  
“Why talk nons
ense?” rejoine
d voices in the 
crowd. “Will t
hey give up Mos
cow like this? T
hey told you tha
"t for fun, and y"
ou believed it! 
 Aren’t there 
plenty of troops
 on the march? L
"et him in, indee"
d! That’s wha
t the government
 is for. You’d
 better listen t
o what people ar
"e
saying,” sa"
id some of the m
ob pointing to t
he tall youth. 
 By the wall of
 China-Town a sm
aller group of p
eople were gathe
red round a man
 in a frieze coa
t who held a pap
er in his hand. 
"

“An ukáse,"
 they are readin
g an ukáse! Rea
ding an ukáse!�
�� cried voices 
"in
the crowd, a"
nd the people ru
shed toward the 
reader.  The m
an in the frieze
 coat was readin
g the broadsheet
 of August 31. W
hen the crowd c
ollected round h
im he seemed con
"fused, but at th"
e demand of the
 tall lad who ha
d pushed his way
" up to him, he b"
egan in a rather
 tremulous voic
e to read the sh
eet from the beg
inning.  “Ea
rly tomorrow I s
hall go to his S
"erene Highness,�"
�� he read (“S
"irin
Highness,�"
�� said the tall
 fellow with a t
riumphant smile 
on his lips and 
 a frown on his 
"brow), “to con"
sult with him to
" act, and to aid"
 the army to ex
terminate these 
scoundrels. We t
oo will take par

"er
went on, and"
 then paused (�
"�Do you see,” "
shouted the yout

 “he’s going

�  The last wo
rds were read ou
t in the midst o
f complete silen
ce. The tall la
d hung his head 
gloomily. It was
 evident that no
 one had underst
ood the last pa
rt. In particula
"r, the words “"
I will come back
" to dinner,”
"
evidently disple
ased both reader
 and audience. T
he people’s mi
nds were tuned 
to a high pitch 
and this was too
 simple and need
lessly comprehe
nsible—it was 
what any one of 
them might have 
said and therefo
re was what an 
ukáse emanating
 from the highes
t authority shou
ld not say.  T
hey all stood de
spondent and sil

rom side to side
.  “We shoul

t’s he himself

ask him indeed!.
.. Why not? He�
��ll explain”.
.. voices in the
 rear of the cro
wd were suddenl
"y heard saying, "
and the general 
attention turned
 to the police 
superintendent�
�s trap which dr
ove into the squ
are attended by 
two mounted dra
goons.  The su
perintendent of 
"police, who had "
gone that mornin
g by Count Rost
opchín’s orde

 connection with
 that matter ac
quired a large s

 crowd bearing d

who were moving 
singly and timi

.  “What peo

� he shouted aga
"in, receiving no"

replied the shop
man in the friez

 he ordered his

perintendent had

 superintendent 
of police turned
 round at that m

something to his

houted the tall 
 youth. “Don�

fferent people a

of the trap.  
Following the su
perintendent of 
police and talki

 direction of th
e Lubyánka Stre

"now, the gentry "
and merchants ha
ve gone away and
 left us to per

” voices in th

and more frequen

CHAPTER XXIV  
On the evening o
f the first of S
"eptember, after "
his interview wi
"th
Kutúzov, Co"
unt Rostopchín 
had returned to 
Moscow mortified
 and offended b
ecause he had no
t been invited t
o attend the cou
"ncil of war, and"
 because Kutúz
ov had paid no a
ttention to his 
offer to take pa
rt in the defen
se of the city; 
amazed also at t
he novel outlook
 revealed to him
"
at the camp, w"
hich treated the
 tranquillity of
 the capital and
 its patriotic 
fervor as not me
rely secondary b
ut quite irrelev
ant and unimpor
tant matters. Di
"stressed, offend"
"ed, and surprise"
"d by all this,
"
Rostopchín had 
returned to Mosc
ow. After supper
 he lay down on 
a sofa without 
"undressing, and "
was awakened soo
n after midnight
 by a courier b
ringing him a le
tter from Kutúz
ov. This letter 
requested the co
unt to send pol
ice officers to 
guide the troops
 through the tow
"n, as the army
"
was retreating t
o the Ryazán ro
ad beyond Moscow
. This was not n
ews to Rostopch
ín. He had know
n that Moscow wo
uld be abandoned
 not merely sinc
e his interview
 the previous da
y with Kutúzov 
on the Poklónny
 Hill but ever 
since the battle
" of Borodinó, f"
or all the gener
als who came to 
 Moscow after th
at battle had sa
id unanimously t
hat it was impos
sible to fight 
"another battle, "
and since then t
he government pr
operty had been 
 removed every n
"ight, and half t"
he inhabitants h
ad left the city
 with Rostopch�
�n’s own permi
ssion. Yet all t
he same this inf
ormation astoni
shed and irritat
"ed the count, co"
ming as it did i
n the form of a 
 simple note wit
h an order from 
"Kutúzov, and re"
"ceived at night,"
 breaking in on
 his beauty slee
p.  When later
 on in his memoi
rs Count Rostopc
hín explained h
is actions at t
"his time, he rep"
eatedly says tha
t he was then ac
tuated by two im
portant conside
rations: to main
tain tranquillit
y in Moscow and 
expedite the de
parture of the i
nhabitants. If o
ne accepts this 
twofold aim all 
 Rostopchín’s
 actions appear 
irreproachable. 
“Why were the 
"holy relics,
th"
"e arms, ammuniti"
"on, gunpowder, a"
nd stores of cor
n not removed? W
hy were thousan
ds of inhabitant
s deceived into 
believing that M
oscow would not
 be given up—a
nd thereby ruine
d?” “To pres
erve the tranqui
llity of the ci
"ty,” explains "
Count Rostopchí
n. “Why were b
undles of useles
s papers from t
he government of
"fices, and Leppi"
ch’s balloon a
nd other articl
es removed?” �
��To leave the t
"own empty,” ex"
plains Count Ros
topchín. One n
eed only admit t
hat public tranq
uillity is in da
nger and any act
ion finds a jus
tification.  A
ll the horrors o
f the reign of t
error were based
 only on solicit
ude for public 
tranquillity.  
"
On what, then, "
was Count Rostop
chín’s fear f
or the tranquill
ity of Moscow b
ased in 1812? Wh
at reason was th
ere for assuming
 any probability
 of an uprising
 in the city? Th
e inhabitants we
re leaving it an
d the retreatin
g troops were fi
lling it. Why sh
ould that cause 
the masses to r
iot?  Neither 
in Moscow nor an
ywhere in Russia
 did anything re
sembling an ins
urrection ever o
ccur when the en
emy entered a to
wn. More than t
en thousand peop
le were still in
 Moscow on the f
irst and second 
"of
September, a"
nd except for a 
mob in the gover
nor’s courtyar
"d, assembled
th"
ere at his biddi
"ng, nothing happ"
ened. It is obvi
ous that there w
ould have been 
even less reason
 to expect a dis
turbance among t
he people if af
ter the battle o
"f Borodinó, whe"
n the surrender 
of Moscow became
 certain or at 
"least probable, "
Rostopchín inst
ead of exciting 
the people by d
istributing arms
 and broadsheets
 had taken steps
 to remove all 
"the holy relics,"
" the gunpowder, "
"munitions, and m"
"oney, and had to"
ld the populati
on plainly that 
the town would b
e abandoned.  
"Rostopchín, tho"
ugh he had patri
"otic sentiments,"
 was a sanguine 
and impulsive m
an who had alway
s moved in the h
ighest administr
ative circles a
nd had no unders
tanding at all o
f the people he 
supposed himself
 to be guiding.
 Ever since the 
enemy’s entry 
into Smolénsk h
e had in imagin
ation been playi
ng the role of d
irector of the p
opular feeling 
of “the heart 
of Russia.” No
t only did it se
em to him (as to
 all administra
tors) that he co
ntrolled the ext
ernal actions of
 Moscow’s inh
"abitants, but he"
 also thought he
 controlled thei
r mental attitud
e by means of h
is broadsheets a
"nd posters, writ"
ten in a coarse 
tone which the 
people despise i
n their own clas
s and do not und
erstand from tho
se in authority
. Rostopchín wa
s so pleased wit
h the fine role 
of leader of po
"pular feeling, a"
nd had grown so 
"used to it, that"
 the necessity o
f relinquishing
 that role and a
bandoning Moscow
 without any her
oic display too
k him unawares a
nd he suddenly f
elt the ground s
lip away from un
"der
his feet, s"
o that he positi
vely did not kno
w what to do. Th
ough he knew it
" was coming, he "
did not till the
 last moment who
leheartedly beli
eve that Moscow
 would be abando
"ned, and did not"
 prepare for it.
 The inhabitant
s left against h
is wishes. If th
e government off
ices were remov
"ed, this was onl"
y done on the de
mand of official
s to whom the co
unt yielded rel
uctantly. He was
 absorbed in the
 role he had cre
ated for himsel
f. As is often t
he case with tho
se gifted with a
n ardent imagin
"ation, though he"
 had long known 
that Moscow woul
d be abandoned h
e knew it only 
with his intelle
"ct, he did not b"
elieve it in his
 heart and did 
not adapt himsel
f mentally to th
is new position 
of affairs.  A
ll his painstaki
ng and energetic
 activity (in ho
w far it was use
ful and had any
 effect on the p
eople is another
 question) had b
een simply dire
cted toward arou
sing in the mass
es his own feeli
ng of patriotic 
 hatred of the F
rench.  But wh
en events assume
d their true his
torical characte
"r, when expressi"
ng hatred for t
he French in wor
ds proved insuff
"icient, when it "
was not even po
ssible to expres
s that hatred by
 fighting a batt
"le, when
self-c"
onfidence was of
 no avail in rel
ation to the one
 question before
"
Moscow, when t"
he whole populat
ion streamed out
 of Moscow as on
"e man,
abandoni"
ng their belongi
ngs and proving 
by that negative
 action all the
 depth of their 
national feeling
", then the role "
chosen by Rostop
chín suddenly 
appeared sensele
ss. He unexpecte
dly felt himself
" ridiculous,
we"
"ak, and alone, w"
ith no ground to
 stand on.  Wh
"en, awakened fro"
"m his sleep, he "
received that co
"ld, peremptory n"
ote from Kutúz
"ov, he felt the "
more irritated t
he more he felt 
himself to blam
e. All that he h
ad been speciall
y put in charge 
"of, the state
p"
roperty which he
 should have rem
"oved, was still "
in Moscow and it
 was no longer 
possible to take
 the whole of it
 away.  “Who
 is to blame for
 it? Who has let
 things come to 
such a pass?” 
he ruminated. �
"��Not I, of cour"
se. I had everyt
hing ready. I ha
d Moscow firmly
 in hand. And th
is is what they 
have let it come
 to! Villains! 
Traitors!” he 
"thought, without"
 clearly definin
g who the villai
ns and traitors
" were, but feeli"
ng it necessary 
to hate those tr
aitors whoever 
they might be wh
o were to blame 
for the false an
d ridiculous pos
ition in which 
he found himself
.  All that ni
ght Count Rostop
chín issued ord
"ers, for which p"
eople came to h
im from all part
s of Moscow. Tho
se about him had
 never seen the 
count so morose
 and irritable. 
  “Your excel

t long such anno

 and angry repli

"e whole affair, "
carefully prepa

"��Oh, tell that "

 about the convi

chín shouted an
grily at the gov

 CHAPTER XXV  
Toward nine o’
clock in the mor
"ning, when the t"
roops were alrea
dy moving throu
"gh Moscow, nobod"
y came to the co
unt any more for
 instructions. 
Those who were a
ble to get away 
were going of th
"eir own accord, "
those who remai
ned behind decid
ed for themselve
s what they must
 do.  The coun
t ordered his ca
rriage that he m
ight drive to So
"kólniki, and sa"
t in his study 
with folded hand
"s, morose, sallo"
"w, and taciturn."
  In quiet and
 untroubled time
s it seems to ev
ery administrato
r that it is on
ly by his effort
s that the whole
 population unde
r his rule is k
"ept going, and i"
n this conscious
ness of being in
dispensable ever
y administrator
 finds the chief
 reward of his l
abor and efforts
. While the sea
 of history rema
ins calm the rul
er-administrator
 in his frail ba
"rk,
holding on "
with a boat hook
 to the ship of 
the people and h
"imself
moving, "
naturally imagin
es that his effo
rts move the shi
p he is holding 
 on to. But as s
oon as a storm a
rises and the se
a begins to heav
e and the ship 
"to move, such a "
delusion is no l
onger possible. 
The ship moves 
independently wi
th its own enorm
"ous motion, the "
boat hook no lon
ger reaches the
" moving vessel, "
and suddenly the
" administrator, "
instead of appe
aring a ruler an
d a source of po
"wer, becomes an "
"insignificant,
"
"useless, feeble "
man.  Rostopch
"ín felt this, a"
nd it was this w
hich exasperated
 him.  The sup
erintendent of p
"olice, whom the "
crowd had stoppe
"d, went in to
s"
ee him at the sa
me time as an ad
jutant who infor
med the count th
at the horses w
ere harnessed. T
hey were both pa
"le, and the supe"
rintendent of p
"olice, after rep"
orting that he h
ad executed the 
instructions he 
"had
received, i"
nformed the coun
t that an immens
e crowd had coll
ected in the co
urtyard and wish
ed to see him. 
 Without saying
 a word Rostopch
ín rose and wal
ked hastily to h
"is light,
luxur"
ious drawing roo
"m, went to the b"
"alcony door, too"
k hold of the h
"andle, let it go"
" again, and went"
 to the window f
rom which he had
 a better view 
of the whole cro
wd. The tall lad
 was standing in
" front,
flouris"
hing his arm and
 saying somethin
g with a stern l
ook. The blood-
stained smith st
ood beside him w
ith a gloomy fac
e. A drone of v
oices was audibl
e through the cl
osed window.  
“Is my carriag
e ready?” aske
"d Rostopchín, s"
tepping back fro
m the window.  
"
“It is, your "
"excellency,” r"
eplied the adjut
ant.  Rostopch
ín went again t
o the balcony do
or.  “But wh
at do they want?
” he asked the
 superintendent 
of police.  �
�Your excellency
", they say they "
"have got ready, "
according to you
"r
orders, to go"
 against the Fre
"nch, and they sh"
outed something 
about treachery
. But it is a tu
"rbulent crowd, y"
our excellency�
�I hardly manage
d to get away f
rom it. Your exc
"ellency, I ventu"
re to suggest...
”  “You ma
y go. I don’t 
need you to tell
 me what to do!�
�� exclaimed Ro
stopchín angril
y.  He stood b
y the balcony do
or looking at th
e crowd.  “T
his is what they
 have done with 
Russia! This is 
what they have d
one with me!”
" thought he, ful"
l of an irrepres
sible fury that 
welled up withi
n him against th
e someone to who
m what was happe
ning might be a
ttributed. As of
ten happens with
 passionate peop
"le, he was maste"
red by anger bu
t was still seek
ing an object on
 which to vent i
t. “Here is t
"hat mob, the dre"
gs of the people
",” he thought "
as he gazed at t
he crowd: “th
is rabble they h
ave roused by th
eir folly! They 
"want a victim,�"
� he thought as
 he looked at th
e tall lad flour
ishing his arm. 
And this though
t occurred to hi
m just because h
e himself desire
"d a victim,
som"
ething on which 
to vent his rage
.  “Is the c
arriage ready?�
� he asked again
".

“Yes, you"
r excellency. Wh
at are your orde
rs about Vereshc
hágin? He is w
aiting at the po
"rch,” said the"
 adjutant.  �
�Ah!” exclaime
"d Rostopchín, a"
s if struck by a
n unexpected rec
ollection.  An
d rapidly openin
g the door he we
nt resolutely ou
t onto the balco
ny. The talking
 instantly cease
"d, hats and caps"
" were doffed, an"
d all eyes were
 raised to the c
ount.  “Good
" morning, lads!�"
�� said the coun
t briskly and lo
udly. “Thank y
ou for coming. 
I’ll come out 
to you in a mome
"nt, but we must "
first settle wi
th the villain. 
We must punish t
he villain who h
as caused the ru
in of Moscow. W
ait for me!” 
 And the count 
stepped as brisk
ly back into the
 room and slamme
d the door behi
nd him.  A mur
mur of approbati
on and satisfact
ion ran through 
the crowd. “He
’ll settle wi
th all the villa
"ins, you’ll se"
e! And you said 
the French... H
e’ll show you 
what law is!” 
the mob were say
ing as if reprov
ing one another
 for their lack 
of confidence. 
 A few minutes 
later an officer
 came hurriedly 
out of the front
" door,
gave an "
"order, and the d"
ragoons formed u
p in line. The c
rowd moved eage
rly from the bal
cony toward the 
porch. Rostopch�
"�n, coming out t"
here with quick
" angry steps, lo"
oked hastily aro
und as if seekin
g someone.  �
�Where is he?”
 he inquired. An
d as he spoke he
 saw a young man
 coming round t
he corner of the
 house between t
wo dragoons. He 
had a long thin 
"
neck, and his h"
"ead, that had be"
"en half shaved, "
was again covere
d by short hair
. This young man
 was dressed in 
a threadbare blu
e cloth coat li
ned with fox fur
", that had once "
"been smart, and "
dirty hempen con
"vict
trousers, "
over which were 
"pulled his thin,"
" dirty, trodden-"
down boots. On 
"his thin, weak l"
egs were heavy c
hains which hamp
ered his irresol
ute movements. 
  “Ah!” sai
"d Rostopchín, h"
urriedly turning
 away his eyes f
rom the young m
an in the fur-li
ned coat and poi
nting to the bot
tom step of the 
porch. “Put h
im there.”  
The young man in
 his clattering 
chains stepped c
lumsily to the s
"pot
indicated, "
holding away wit
h one finger the
 coat collar whi
ch chafed his n
"eck, turned his "
long neck twice 
this way and tha
"t, sighed, and
"
submissively fol
ded before him h
"is thin hands, u"
nused to work. 
 For several se
conds while the 
young man was ta
king his place o
n the step the 
silence continue
d. Only among th
e back rows of t
"he people, who w"
ere all pressin
g toward the one
" spot, could sig"
"hs, groans, and "
the shuffling o
f feet be heard.
  While waitin
g for the young 
man to take his 
place on the ste
p Rostopchín s
tood frowning an
d rubbing his fa
ce with his hand
.  “Lads!”
" said he, with a"
 metallic ring i
n his voice. “
"This man,
Veres"
"hchágin, is the"
 scoundrel by wh
ose doing Moscow
 is perishing.�
�  The young m
an in the fur-li
"ned coat, stoopi"
"ng a little, sto"
od in a submiss
"ive attitude, hi"
s fingers claspe
d before him. Hi
s emaciated youn
"g
face, disfigu"
red by the half-
"shaven head, hun"
g down hopelessl
y. At the count
’s first words
 he raised it sl
owly and looked 
up at him as if 
 wishing to say 
something or at 
least to meet hi
s eye. But Rosto
pchín did not 
look at him. A v
ein in the young
 man’s long th
in neck swelled 
like a cord and
 went blue behin
"d the ear, and s"
uddenly his face
 flushed.  All
 eyes were fixed
 on him. He look
"ed at the crowd,"
 and rendered mo
re hopeful by t
he expression he
 read on the fac
"es there, he smi"
led sadly and t
"imidly, and lowe"
ring his head sh
ifted his feet o
n the step.  �
��He has betraye
d his Tsar and h
"is country, he h"
as gone over to 
 Bonaparte. He a
lone of all the 
Russians has dis
graced the Russi
"an name,
he has"
 caused Moscow t
"o perish,” sai"
d Rostopchín in
" a sharp, even v"
"oice,
but sudde"
nly he glanced d
own at Vereshch�
�gin who continu
ed to stand in 
the same submiss
ive attitude. As
 if inflamed by 
"the sight, he ra"
ised his arm an
d addressed the 
"people, almost s"
houting:  “D
eal with him as 
you think fit! I
 hand him over t
o you.”  The
 crowd remained 
silent and only 
pressed closer a
nd closer to on
e another. To ke
ep one another b
"ack, to breathe "
in that stifling
"
atmosphere, to"
 be unable to st
"ir, and to await"
 something unkno
"wn,
uncomprehen"
"ded, and terribl"
"e, was becoming "
unbearable. Thos
e standing in f
"ront, who had se"
en and heard wha
t had taken plac
"e before them, a"
ll stood with w
ide-open eyes an
"d mouths, strain"
ing with all the
"ir strength,
an"
d held back the 
crowd that was p
ushing behind th
em.  “Beat h
im!... Let the t
raitor perish an
d not disgrace t
he Russian name!
” shouted Ros
topchín. “Cut
 him down. I com
mand it.”  H
earing not so mu
ch the words as 
the angry tone o
f Rostopchín’
"s voice,
the cr"
owd moaned and h
"eaved forward, b"
ut again paused.
  “Count!”
 exclaimed the t
imid yet theatri
cal voice of Ver
eshchágin in th
e midst of the 
momentary silenc
"e that ensued, �"
��Count! One God
 is above us bo
th....” He lif
ted his head and
 again the thick
 vein in his thi
n neck filled w
ith blood and th
e color rapidly 
came and went in
 his face.  He
 did not finish 
what he wished t
o say.  “Cut
 him down! I com
mand it...” sh
outed Rostopchí
"n, suddenly grow"
ing pale like V
ereshchágin.  
 “Draw sabers!
” cried the dr
"agoon officer, d"
rawing his own. 
  Another still
 stronger wave f
lowed through th
e crowd and reac
hing the front 
ranks carried it
 swaying to the 
very steps of th
e porch. The tal
"l
youth, with a"
 stony look on h
"is face, and rig"
id and uplifted 
"arm, stood
besi"
de Vereshchágin
.  “Saber hi
m!” the dragoo
n officer almost
 whispered.  A
nd one of the so
"ldiers, his face"
 all at once dis
torted with fury
",
struck Veresh"
chágin on the h
ead with the blu
nt side of his s
aber.  “Ah!�
�� cried Vereshc
hágin in meek s
"urprise, looking"
 round with a f
rightened glance
 as if not under
standing why thi
s was done to hi
m. A similar mo
an of surprise a
nd horror ran th
rough the crowd.
 “O Lord!” 
exclaimed a sorr
owful voice.  
But after the ex
clamation of sur
prise that had e
scaped from Vere
shchágin he ut
tered a plaintiv
"e cry of pain, a"
nd that cry was 
fatal. The barri
er of human fee
"ling, strained t"
"o the utmost, th"
at had held the 
crowd in check 
suddenly broke. 
The crime had be
gun and must now
 be completed. T
he plaintive mo
an of reproach w
as drowned by th
e threatening an
d angry roar of
 the crowd. Like
 the seventh and
 last wave that 
"shatters a ship,"
 that last irre
sistible wave bu
rst from the rea
r and reached th
"e front ranks,
"
carrying them of
f their feet and
 engulfing them 
all. The dragoon
 was about to r
epeat his blow. 
Vereshchágin wi
th a cry of horr
"or, covering
hi"
s head with his 
"hands, rushed to"
ward the crowd. 
"The tall youth,"
 against whom he
" stumbled, seize"
d his thin neck 
with his hands a
"nd,
yelling wil"
"dly, fell with h"
im under the fee
t of the pressin
"g, struggling
c"
rowd.  Some be
at and tore at V
"ereshchágin, ot"
hers at the tall
 youth. And the 
 screams of thos
e that were bein
g trampled on an
d of those who t
ried to rescue 
the tall lad onl
y increased the 
fury of the crow
d. It was a long
 time before th
e dragoons could
 extricate the b
"leeding youth, b"
eaten almost to
 death. And for 
"a long time, des"
pite the feveris
h haste with wh
ich the mob trie
d to end the wor
k that had been 
"begun, those who"
" were
hitting, "
"throttling, and "
tearing at Veres
hchágin were un
able to kill hi
"m, for the crowd"
 pressed from al
"l sides, swaying"
 as one mass wit
h them in the c
enter and render
ing it impossibl

 “Hit him with

  Only when the

is cries changed
 to a long-draw

 crowd around hi
"s prostrate,

"ch one came
up,"
 glanced at what

"and with horror,"
" reproach, and

astonishment pus
hed back again. 
  “O Lord! Th

 in the crowd co

d the same mob n
"ow, looking with"
 pained distres
s at the dead bo
dy with its long

s livid face st
ained with blood
 and dust.  A 
painstaking poli

idering the pres

 in his excelle

"d unseemly, told"
 the dragoons to
 take it away. 
Two dragoons too

ragged it along

 crowd shrank ba

n suddenly turne

oar of the yelli
ng crowd was aud
ible even there.
 He hastily too
k his seat and t
old the coachman
 to drive him to
 his country hou
se in Sokólnik
i.  When they 
reached the Myas
nítski Street a
nd could no long
er hear the sho
"uts of the mob, "
the count began 
to repent. He re
membered with d
issatisfaction t
he agitation and
 fear he had bet
rayed before his
 subordinates. 
“The mob is te
rrible—disgust
"ing,” he said "
to himself in F
rench. “They a
re like wolves w
hom nothing but 
flesh can appeas
e.” “Count!
 One God is abov
e us both!”—
Vereshchágin’
s words suddenly
 recurred to hi
"m, and a disagre"
eable shiver ran
 down his back. 
But this was on
ly a momentary f
eeling and Count
 Rostopchín smi
led disdainfully
 at himself. �
�I had other dut
"ies,” thought "
he. “The peopl
e had to be app
eased. Many othe
r victims have p
erished and are 
perishing for th
e public good�
�—and he began
 thinking of his
 social duties t
o his family an
d to the city en
"trusted to him, "
and of himself�
�not himself as 
Theodore Vasíl
yevich Rostopch�
�n (he fancied t
hat Theodore Vas
ílyevich Rostop
chín was sacri
ficing himself f
or the public go
od) but himself 
"as governor,
th"
e representative
 of authority an
d of the Tsar. �
��Had I been sim
ply Theodore Va
sílyevich my co
urse of action w
ould have been q
"uite
different,"
 but it was my d
uty to safeguard
 my life and dig
nity as command
er in chief.” 
  Lightly swayi
ng on the flexib
le springs of hi
s carriage and n
o longer hearin
g the terrible s
ounds of the cro
"wd, Rostopchín "
grew physically 
"
calm and, as al"
"ways happens, as"
 soon as he beca
me physically tr
anquil his mind
 devised reasons
 why he should b
e mentally tranq
uil too. The th
ought which tran
quillized Rostop
chín was not a 
new one. Since t
he world began 
and men have kil
led one another 
no one has ever 
committed such 
a crime against 
his fellow man w
ithout comfortin
g himself with 
this same idea. 
This idea is le 
"bien public, the"
 hypothetical we
lfare of other 
people.  To a 
man not swayed b
y passion that w
elfare is never 
"certain, but he"
 who commits suc
h a crime always
 knows just wher
e that welfare l
ies. And Rostop
chín now knew i
t.  Not only d
id his reason no
t reproach him f
or what he had d
"one, but
he eve"
n found cause fo
r self-satisfact
ion in having so
 successfully c
ontrived to avai
l himself of a c
onvenient opport
unity to punish 
a criminal and 
at the same time
 pacify the mob.
  “Vereshch�
�gin was tried a
nd condemned to 
"death,” though"
t Rostopchín (
though the Senat
e had only conde
mned Vereshchág
in to hard labor
"), “he
was a "
traitor and a sp
y. I could not l
et him go unpuni
shed and so I ha
ve killed two b
irds with one st
one: to appease 
the mob I gave t
hem a victim an
d at the same ti
me punished a mi
screant.”  H
aving reached hi
s country house 
and begun to giv
e orders about d
omestic arrange
"ments, the count"
 grew quite tran
quil.  Half an
 hour later he w
as driving with 
his fast horses 
across the Sok�
"�lniki field, no"
 longer thinking
 of what had occ
urred but consid
ering what was 
to come. He was 
driving to the Y
aúza bridge whe
re he had heard 
 that Kutúzov w
as. Count Rostop
chín was mental
ly preparing the
 angry and stin
ging reproaches 
he meant to addr
ess to Kutúzov 
for his deceptio
n. He would mak
e that foxy old 
courtier feel th
at the responsib
ility for all t
he calamities th
at would follow 
the abandonment 
of the city and 
the ruin of Rus
sia (as Rostopch
ín regarded it)
 would fall upon
 his doting old
 head. Planning 
beforehand what 
he would say to 
"Kutúzov, Rostop"
chín turned an
grily in his cal
èche and gazed 
sternly from sid
e to side.  Th
e Sokólniki fie
ld was deserted.
 Only at the end
" of it, in front"
 of the almshou
se and the lunat
"ic asylum, could"
 be seen some pe
ople in white a
nd others like t
hem walking sing
ly across the fi
eld shouting and
 gesticulating.
  One of these
 was running to 
cross the path o
f Count Rostopch
ín’s carriag
"e, and the count"
" himself, his co"
"achman, and his "
dragoons looked
 with vague horr
or and curiosity
 at these releas
ed lunatics and 
 especially at t
he one running t
oward them.  S
waying from side
 to side on his 
"long, thin legs "
in his flutterin
g dressing gown
", this lunatic w"
as running impet
"uously, his gaze"
 fixed on Rosto
"pchín, shouting"
 something in a 
hoarse voice and
 making signs to
 him to stop. T
he lunatic’s s
"olemn, gloomy fa"
ce was thin and 
"yellow, with
it"
s beard growing 
in uneven tufts.
" His black, agat"
e pupils with s
affron-yellow wh
ites moved restl
essly near the l
ower eyelids.  
 “Stop! Pull u
"p, I tell you!�"
� he cried in a 
"piercing voice, "
and again shout
ed something bre
athlessly with e
mphatic intonati
ons and gestures
.  Coming abre
ast of the calè
che he ran besid
e it.  “Thri
ce have they sla
"in me, thrice ha"
ve I risen from 
the dead. They 
"stoned me, cruci"
fied me... I sha
ll rise... shall
 rise... shall r
ise. They have 
torn my body. Th
e kingdom of God
 will be overthr
own... Thrice w
ill I overthrow 
it and thrice re
-establish it!�
"� he cried, rais"
ing his voice h
igher and higher
.  Count Rosto
pchín suddenly 
grew pale as he 
had done when th
e crowd closed 
in on Vereshchá
gin. He turned a
way. “Go fas..
. faster!” he 
cried in a trem
bling voice to h
is coachman. The
 calèche flew o
ver the ground a
s fast as the h
orses could draw
" it, but for a l"
ong time Count R
ostopchín stil
l heard the insa
ne despairing sc
reams growing fa
inter in the di
"stance, while hi"
s eyes saw nothi
ng but the aston
"ished, frightene"
"d,
bloodstained"
 face of “the 
traitor” in th
e fur-lined coat
.  Recent as t
hat mental pictu
"re was, Rostopch"
ín already felt
 that it had cu
t deep into his 
heart and drawn 
blood. Even now 
he felt clearly 
that the gory t
race of that rec
ollection would 
not pass with ti
"me, but that
th"
e terrible memor
"y would, on the "
"contrary, dwell "
in his heart eve
r more cruelly 
and painfully to
 the end of his 
life. He seemed 
still to hear t
he sound of his 
own words: “Cu
t him down! I co
mmand it....” 
  “Why did I 
utter those word
s? It was by som
e accident I sai
d them.... I ne
ed not have said
" them,” he tho"
ught. “And the
n nothing would 
have happened.�
�� He saw the fr
ightened and the
n infuriated fac
e of the dragoon
 who dealt the 
"blow, the look o"
"f silent, timid "
reproach that bo
y in the fur-li
ned coat had tur
ned upon him. �
�But I did not d
o it for my own 
 sake. I was bou
nd to act that w
"ay.... The mob, "
the traitor... t
he public welfa
"re,” thought h"
e.  Troops wer
e still crowding
 at the Yaúza b
ridge. It was ho
"t. Kutúzov,
de"
jected and frown
"ing, sat on a be"
nch by the bridg
e toying with hi
s whip in the s
and when a calè
che dashed up no
isily. A man in 
a general’s u
niform with plum
es in his hat we
nt up to Kutúzo
v and said somet
hing in French.
 It was Count Ro
stopchín. He to
ld Kutúzov that
 he had come be
"cause Moscow, th"
"e capital, was n"
o more and only 
the army remaine
d.  “Things 
would have been 
different if you
r Serene Highnes
s had not told 
me that you woul
d not abandon Mo
scow without ano
ther battle; all
 this would not
" have happened,�"
�� he said.  K
utúzov looked a
t Rostopchín as
" if, not graspin"
g what was said 
"to him,
he was "
trying to read s
omething peculia
r written at tha
t moment on the 
 face of the man
 addressing him.
 Rostopchín gre
w confused and b
ecame silent. K
utúzov slightly
 shook his head 
and not taking h
is penetrating 
gaze from Rostop
chín’s face m
uttered softly: 
  “No! I shal
l not give up Mo
scow without a b
attle!”  Whe
ther Kutúzov wa
s thinking of so
mething entirely
 different when 
 he spoke those 
"words, or uttere"
d them purposely
", knowing them t"
o be meaningles
"s, at any rate R"
ostopchín made 
no reply and has
tily left him. 
And strange to s
"ay, the Governor"
" of Moscow, the "
proud Count Rost
"opchín,
took u"
p a Cossack whip
 and went to the
 bridge where he
 began with shou
ts to drive on 
the carts that b
locked the way. 
      CHAPT
ER XXVI  Towar
d four o’clock
 in the afternoo
n Murat’s troo
ps were entering
 Moscow. In fro
nt rode a detach
ment of Württem
berg hussars and
 behind them ro
de the King of N
aples himself ac
companied by a n
umerous suite. 
 About the midd
le of the Arbát
" Street, near th"
e Church of the 
Miraculous Icon
 of St. Nicholas
", Murat halted t"
o await news fro
m the advanced 
detachment as to
 the condition i
n which they had
 found the citad
"el, le
Kremlin."
  Around Murat
 gathered a grou
p of those who h
ad remained in M
oscow. They all
 stared in timid
 bewilderment at
" the strange, lo"
ng-haired comman
der dressed up 
in feathers and 
gold.  “Is t
hat their Tsar h
imself? He’s n
ot bad!” low v
oices could be h
eard saying.  
 An interpreter 
rode up to the g
roup.  “Take
 off your cap...
 your caps!” T
hese words went 
from one to anot
her in the crow
d. The interpret
er addressed an 
old porter and a
sked if it was 
far to the Krém
"lin. The porter,"
 listening in pe
rplexity to the 
 unfamiliar Poli
sh accent and no
t realizing that
 the interpreter
 was speaking R
"ussian, did not "
understand what 
was being said t
o him and slipp
ed behind the ot
hers.  Murat a
pproached the in
terpreter and to
ld him to ask wh
ere the Russian 
 army was. One o
f the Russians u
nderstood what w
as asked and sev
eral voices at 
once began answe
ring the interpr
eter. A French o
"fficer,
returni"
ng from the adva
"nced detachment,"
 rode up to Mura
t and reported 
that the gates o
f the citadel ha
d been barricade
d and that there
 was probably a
n ambuscade ther
e.  “Good!�
� said Murat and
", turning to one"
 of the gentleme
"n in his suite,"
 ordered four li
ght guns to be m
oved forward to 
fire at the gate
s.  The guns e
merged at a trot
 from the column
 following Murat
 and advanced u
p the Arbát. Wh
en they reached 
the end of the V
ozdvízhenka Str
eet they halted
 and drew in the
 Square. Several
 French officers
 superintended t
he placing of t
he guns and look
ed at the Kréml
in through field
 glasses.  The
 bells in the Kr
émlin were ring
"ing for vespers,"
 and this sound 
 troubled the Fr
ench. They imagi
ned it to be a c
all to arms. A f
ew infantrymen 
ran to the Kutá
fyev Gate. Beams
 and wooden scre
ens had been pu
"t there, and two"
 musket shots ra
ng out from unde
r the gate as so
on as an office
r and men began 
to run toward it
. A general who 
was standing by
 the guns shoute
d some words of 
command to the o
"fficer, and the "
latter ran back
 again with his 
men.  The soun
d of three more 
shots came from 
the gate.  One
 shot struck a F
rench soldier’
"s foot, and from"
 behind the scre
ens came the st
range sound of a
 few voices shou
ting. Instantly 
as at a word of
 command the exp
ression of cheer
ful serenity on 
the faces of th
e French general
", officers, and "
men changed to o
ne of determined
 concentrated r
eadiness for str
ife and sufferin
g. To all of the
m from the mars
hal to the least
" soldier, that p"
lace was not the
" Vozdvízhenka,"
"
Mokhaváya, or "
Kutáfyev Street
", nor the Tróit"
sa Gate (places 
familiar in Mos
"cow), but a new "
battlefield whic
h would probably
 prove sanguinar
y. And all made
 ready for that 
battle. The crie
s from the gates
 ceased. The gu
ns were advanced
", the artillerym"
en blew the ash 
off their linsto
"cks,
and an off"
icer gave the wo
rd “Fire!” T
his was followed
 by two whistlin
g sounds of can
"ister shot, one "
after another. T
he shot rattled 
against the sto
ne of the gate a
nd upon the wood
en beams and scr
"eens, and two
w"
avering clouds o
f smoke rose ove
r the Square.  
 A few instants 
after the echo o
f the reports re
sounding over th
e stone-built K
rémlin had died
 away the French
 heard a strange
 sound above th
eir head. Thousa
nds of crows ros
e above the wall
s and circled in
" the
air, cawin"
g and noisily fl
apping their win
gs. Together wit
h that sound ca
me a solitary hu
man cry from the
 gateway and ami
d the smoke appe
ared the figure
 of a bareheaded
 man in a peasan
t’s coat. He g
rasped a musket 
 and took aim at
 the French. “
Fire!” repeate
d the officer on
"ce more,
and th"
e reports of a m
usket and of two
 cannon shots we
re heard simult
aneously. The ga
te was again hid
den by smoke.  
 Nothing more st
irred behind the
 screens and the
 French infantry
 soldiers and o
fficers advanced
 to the gate. In
 the gateway lay
 three wounded a
nd four dead. T
wo men in peasan
t coats ran away
 at the foot of 
"the wall,
towar"
d the Známenka.
  “Clear tha
t away!” said 
"the officer, poi"
nting to the bea
ms and the corp
"ses, and the Fre"
"nch soldiers, af"
ter dispatching 
"the wounded, thr"
ew the corpses 
over the parapet
.  Who these m
en were nobody k
new. “Clear th
at away!” was 
all that was sai
"d
of them, and "
they were thrown
 over the parape
t and removed la
ter on that the
y might not stin
k. Thiers alone 
dedicates a few 
eloquent lines t
o their memory:
 “These wretch
es had occupied 
the sacred citad
"el, having
supp"
lied themselves 
with guns from t
"he arsenal, and "
fired” (the w
retches) “at t
he French. Some 
of them were sab
ered and the Kr�
�mlin was purge
d of their prese
nce.”  Murat
 was informed th
at the way had b
een cleared. The
 French entered 
 the gates and b
egan pitching th
eir camp in the 
Senate Square. O
ut of the windo
ws of the Senate
 House the soldi
ers threw chairs
 into the Square
 for fuel and k
indled fires the
re.  Other det
achments passed 
through the Kré
mlin and encampe
d along the Mor
"oséyka, the Lub"
"yánka, and Pokr"
óvka Streets. O
thers quartered 
 themselves alon
g the Vozdvízhe
"nka, the Nikóls"
"ki, and the Tver"
skóy Streets. 
No masters of th
e houses being f
"ound anywhere, t"
he French were 
not billeted on 
the inhabitants 
as is usual in t
owns but lived i
n it as in a ca
mp.  Though ta
"ttered, hungry, "
"worn out, and re"
duced to a third
 of their origi
"nal number, the "
French entered M
oscow in good ma
rching order. It
 was a weary an
"d famished, but "
still a fighting
 and menacing ar
my. But it rema
ined an army onl
y until its sold
iers had dispers
ed into their d
ifferent lodging
s. As soon as th
e men of the var
ious regiments b
egan to dispers
e among the weal
thy and deserted
" houses, the arm"
y was lost fore
ver and there ca
me into being so
mething nondescr
"ipt, neither
ci"
tizens nor soldi
ers but what are
 known as maraud
ers. When five w
eeks later thes
e same men left 
"Moscow, they no "
longer formed an
 army. They wer
e a mob of marau
"ders, each carry"
ing a quantity o
f articles which
 seemed to him 
valuable or usef
ul. The aim of e
ach man when he 
left Moscow was
" no longer, as i"
"t had been, to c"
"onquer, but mere"
ly to keep what
 he had acquired
. Like a monkey 
which puts its p
aw into the narr
ow neck of a ju
"g, and having se"
ized a handful o
f nuts will not 
open its fist f
or fear of losin
"g what it holds,"
 and therefore p
"erishes, the
Fr"
ench when they l
eft Moscow had i
nevitably to per
ish because they
 carried their 
"loot with them, "
yet to abandon w
hat they had sto
len was as impo
ssible for them 
as it is for the
 monkey to open 
its paw and let 
 go of its nuts.
 Ten minutes aft
er each regiment
 had entered a M
"oscow
district,"
 not a soldier o
r officer was le
ft. Men in milit
ary uniforms an
d Hessian boots 
could be seen th
rough the window
"s, laughing and"
 walking through
 the rooms. In c
ellars and store
rooms similar me
n were busy amo
ng the provision
"s, and in the ya"
rds unlocking or
 breaking open 
coach house and 
"stable doors, li"
ghting fires in 
kitchens and kne
ading and bakin
g bread with rol
"led-up sleeves, "
and cooking; or 
"frightening,
am"
"using, or caress"
ing women and ch
ildren. There we
re many such men
 both in the sh
ops and houses�
�but there was n
o army.  Order
 after order was
 issued by the F
rench commanders
 that day forbi
dding the men to
 disperse about 
"the town, sternl"
y forbidding any
 violence to th
e inhabitants or
" any looting, an"
d announcing a r
oll call for th
at very evening.
 But despite all
 these measures 
"the men, who had"
 till then cons
"tituted an army,"
 flowed all over
" the wealthy, de"
serted city wit
h its comforts a
nd plentiful sup
plies. As a hung
ry herd of catt
le keeps well to
gether when cros
sing a barren fi
"eld, but gets ou"
t of hand and a
t once disperses
 uncontrollably 
as soon as it re
aches rich past
"ures, so did the"
 army disperse a
ll over the weal
thy city.  No 
residents were l
"eft in Moscow, a"
nd the soldiers�
��like water pe
rcolating throug
h sand—spread 
irresistibly thr
ough the city in
 all directions
 from the Kréml
in into which th
ey had first mar
ched. The caval
"ry, on entering "
a merchant’s h
ouse that had be
en abandoned and
 finding there 
stabling more th
an sufficient fo
"r their horses, "
"went on,
all th"
"e same, to the n"
ext house which 
seemed to them b
etter. Many of 
them appropriate
d several houses
", chalked their "
"names on them, a"
nd quarreled an
d even fought wi
th other compani
es for them. Bef
ore they had ha
d time to secure
 quarters the so
ldiers ran out i
nto the streets 
to see the city
" and, hearing th"
at everything ha
d been abandoned
", rushed
to pla"
ces where valuab
les were to be h
ad for the takin
g. The officers 
 followed to che
ck the soldiers 
and were involun
tarily drawn int
o doing the sam
e. In Carriage R
ow carriages had
 been left in th
"e shops, and
ge"
nerals flocked t
here to select c
alèches and coa
ches for themsel
ves. The few in
habitants who ha
d remained invit
ed commanding of
ficers to their
" houses, hoping "
thereby to secur
e themselves fro
m being plundere
d. There were m
asses of wealth 
and there seemed
 no end to it. A
ll around the q
uarters occupied
 by the French w
ere other region
s still unexplor
ed and unoccupi
"ed where, they t"
"hought, yet grea"
ter riches might
 be found. And 
Moscow engulfed 
the army ever de
eper and deeper.
 When water is 
spilled on dry g
round both the d
ry ground and th
e water disappea
r and mud resul
ts; and in the s
ame way the entr
y of the famishe
d army into the 
 rich and desert
ed city resulted
 in fires and lo
oting and the de
struction of bo
th the army and 
the wealthy city
.   The Frenc
h attributed the
 Fire of Moscow 
au patriotisme f
éroce de Rosto
"pchíne, * the R"
ussians to the b
arbarity of the 
French. In reali
"ty,
however, it"
" was not, and co"
"uld not be, poss"
ible to explain 
the burning of 
Moscow by making
" any individual,"
 or any group of
" people, respons"
ible for it. Mo
scow was burned 
because it found
 itself in a pos
ition in which 
any town built o
f wood was bound
" to burn, quite "
apart from wheth
"er it
had, or h"
"ad not, a hundre"
d and thirty inf
erior fire engin
es. Deserted Mo
scow had to burn
 as inevitably a
s a heap of shav
ings has to burn
 on which spark
s continually fa
ll for several d
ays. A town buil
"t of wood,
wher"
e scarcely a day
 passes without 
conflagrations w
hen the house ow
ners are in res
idence and a pol
ice force is pre
"sent, cannot hel"
p burning when 
its inhabitants 
have left it and
 it is occupied 
by soldiers who 
"smoke
pipes, ma"
ke campfires of 
the Senate chair
s in the Senate 
"Square, and
coo"
k themselves mea
ls twice a day. 
In peacetime it 
is only necessar
y to billet tro
ops in the villa
ges of any distr
ict and the numb
er of fires in 
that district im
mediately increa
ses. How much th
en must the prob
ability of fire
 be increased in
" an abandoned, w"
ooden town where
 foreign troops 
 are quartered. 
“Le patriotism
e féroce de Ros
topchíne” and
 the barbarity 
of the French we
re not to blame 
in the matter. M
oscow was set on
 fire by the so
"ldiers’ pipes,"
" kitchens, and c"
"ampfires, and by"
 the carelessnes
s of enemy sold
iers occupying h
ouses they did n
ot own. Even if 
there was any a
rson (which is v
"ery doubtful, fo"
r no one had any
 reason to burn 
the houses—in
 any case a trou
blesome and dang
erous thing to d
"o), arson
canno"
t be regarded as
" the cause, for "
the same thing w

"se of the
fire,"
 for Moscow had 
to burn as every
" village, factor"
"y, or house must"
 burn which is 
left by its owne
rs and in which 
strangers are al
lowed to live a
nd cook their po
rridge. Moscow w
as burned by its
" inhabitants, it"
"
is true, but b"
y those who had 
abandoned it and
 not by those wh
o remained in i
t. Moscow when o
ccupied by the e
nemy did not rem
ain intact like 
"
Berlin, Vienna,"
 and other towns
", simply because"
 its inhabitants
 abandoned it a
nd did not welco
me the French wi
th bread and sal
"t, nor
bring th"
em the keys of t
he city.    
  CHAPTER XXVI
I  The absorpt
ion of the Frenc
"h by Moscow, rad"
iating starwise 
"as it did,
only"
 reached the qua
rter where Pierr
e was staying by
 the evening of 
the second of S
eptember.  Aft
er the last two 
days spent in so
litude and unusu
al circumstances
",
Pierre was in"
 a state borderi
ng on insanity. 
He was completel
y obsessed by o
ne persistent th
ought. He did no
t know how or wh
en this thought 
had taken such 
possession of hi
"m, but he rememb"
ered nothing of 
"the past,
under"
stood nothing of
" the present, an"
d all he saw and
 heard appeared 
to him like a d
ream.  He had 
left home only t
o escape the int
ricate tangle of
 life’s demand
s that enmeshed
" him, and which "
in his present c
ondition he was 
unable to unrav
el. He had gone 
to Joseph Alexé
"evich’s house,"
 on the plea of 
 sorting the dec
eased’s books 
"and papers, only"
 in search of re
st from life’
"s turmoil, for i"
n his mind the m
emory of Joseph 
Alexéevich was 
 connected with 
a world of etern
"al, solemn, and "
"calm thoughts, q"
uite contrary t
o the restless c
onfusion into wh
ich he felt hims
elf being drawn
. He sought a qu
"iet refuge, and "
in Joseph Alexé
evich’s study 
he really found
 it. When he sat
 with his elbows
 on the dusty wr
iting table in 
the deathlike st
illness of the s
"tudy, calm and s"
ignificant memor
ies of the last
 few days rose o
ne after another
 in his imaginat
"ion,
particular"
ly of the battle
 of Borodinó an
d of that vague 
sense of his ow
n insignificance
 and insincerity
 compared with t
"he truth, simpli"
"city,
and stren"
gth of the class
 of men he menta
lly classed as t
hey. When Gerá
sim roused him f
rom his reverie 
the idea occurre
d to him of taki
ng part in the 
popular defense 
of Moscow which 
he knew was proj
ected. And with
 that object he 
had asked Gerás
im to get him a 
peasant’s coat
" and
a pistol, "
confiding to him
 his intentions 
of remaining in 
Joseph Alexéev
ich’s house an
d keeping his na
me secret. Then 
during the first
 day spent in i
naction and soli
tude (he tried s
everal times to 
fix his attenti
on on the Masoni
"c manuscripts, b"
ut was unable to
 do so) the idea
 that had previ
ously occurred t
o him of the cab
alistic signific
ance of his nam
e in connection 
with Bonaparte�
�s more than onc
e vaguely presen
ted itself. But
 the idea that h
"e, L’russe Bes"
"uhof, was destin"
ed to set a lim
it to the power 
of the Beast was
 as yet only one
 of the fancies 
that often pass
ed through his m
ind and left no 
trace behind.  
"
When, having bo"
ught the coat me
rely with the ob
ject of taking p
art among the p
eople in the def
"ense of Moscow, "
Pierre had met t
he Rostóvs and 
 Natásha had sa
id to him: “Ar
e you remaining 
in Moscow?... Ho
w splendid!” 
the thought flas
hed into his min
d that it really
 would be a good
" thing,
even if"
 Moscow were tak
"en, for him to r"
emain there and 
do what he was 
predestined to d
"o.

Next day, "
with the sole id
ea of not sparin
g himself and no
t lagging in an
y way behind the
"m, Pierre went t"
o the Three Hill
s gate. But when
 he returned to
 the house convi
nced that Moscow
 would not be de
"fended, he
sudd"
enly felt that w
hat before had s
eemed to him mer
ely a possibilit
y had now becom
e absolutely nec
essary and inevi
table. He must r
emain in Moscow
", concealing his"
" name, and must "
meet Napoleon an
"d kill him, and"
 either perish o
r put an end to 
the misery of al
l Europe—which
 it seemed to h
im was solely du
e to Napoleon. 
 Pierre knew al
l the details of
 the attempt on 
Bonaparte’s li
fe in 1809 by a
 German student 
"in Vienna, and k"
new that the stu
dent had been sh
ot. And the ris
k to which he wo
uld expose his l
ife by carrying 
out his design 
excited him stil
l more.  Two e
qually strong fe
elings drew Pier
re irresistibly 
to this purpose.
 The first was 
a feeling of the
 necessity of sa
crifice and suff
ering in view o
f the common cal
"amity, the same "
feeling that had
 caused him to g
o to Mozháysk 
on the twenty-fi
fth and to make 
his way to the v
ery thick of th
e battle and had
 now caused him 
to run away from
" his home and, i"
n place of the 
luxury and comfo
rt to which he w
"as accustomed, t"
o sleep on a ha
rd sofa without 
undressing and e
at the same food
 as Gerásim. T
he other was tha
t vague and quit
e Russian feelin
g of contempt fo
r everything co
"nventional, arti"
"ficial, and huma"
n—for everythi
ng the majority
 of men regard a
s the greatest g
ood in the world
. Pierre had fi
rst experienced 
this strange and
 fascinating fee
ling at the Slob
"óda
Palace, wh"
en he had sudden
ly felt that wea
"lth, power, and "
life—all that 
 men so painstak
ingly acquire an
d guard—if it 
has any worth ha
s so only by re
ason of the joy 
with which it ca
n all be renounc
ed.  It was th
e feeling that i
nduces a volunte
er recruit to sp
end his last pe
"nny on drink, an"
d a drunken man 
to smash mirrors
 or glasses for 
no apparent rea
son and knowing 
that it will cos
t him all the mo
ney he possesse
s: the feeling w
hich causes a ma
n to perform act
ions which from 
 an ordinary poi
nt of view are i
"nsane, to test, "
"as it were, his "
personal power 
"and strength, af"
firming the exis
tence of a highe
"r, nonhuman
cri"
terion of life. 
  From the very
 day Pierre had 
experienced this
 feeling for the
 first time at 
the Slobóda Pal
ace he had been 
continuously und
er its influence
", but
only now "
found full satis
faction for it. 
"Moreover, at thi"
s moment Pierre 
 was supported i
n his design and
 prevented from 
renouncing it by
 what he had al
ready done in th
at direction. If
 he were now to 
leave Moscow lik
e everyone else
", his flight fro"
"m home, the peas"
"ant coat, the pi"
"stol, and
his a"
nnouncement to t
he Rostóvs that
 he would remain
 in Moscow would
 all become not
 merely meaningl
ess but contempt
ible and ridicul
"ous, and to
thi"
s Pierre was ver
y sensitive.  
Pierre’s physi
"cal condition, a"
s is always the 
"case, correspond"
ed to his menta
l state. The una
ccustomed coarse
" food, the vodka"
 he drank during
"
those days, th"
e absence of win
"e and cigars, hi"
s dirty unchange
"d linen,
two al"
most sleepless n
ights passed on 
a short sofa wit
hout bedding—a
ll this kept hi
m in a state of 
excitement borde
ring on insanity
.  It was two 
o’clock in the
 afternoon. The 
French had alrea
dy entered Mosc
ow. Pierre knew 
"this, but instea"
d of acting he o
nly thought abou
t his undertaki
"ng, going over i"
ts minutest deta
ils in his mind.
 In his fancy h
e did not clearl
y picture to him
self either the 
striking of the 
 blow or the dea
"th of Napoleon, "
but with extraor
dinary vividness
 and melancholy
 enjoyment imagi
ned his own dest
ruction and hero
ic endurance.  
"
“Yes, alone, "
for the sake of 
"all, I must do i"
t or perish!” 
he thought. “
"Yes, I will appr"
oach... and then
 suddenly... wit
h pistol or dagg
er? But that is
 all the same! �
��It is not I bu
t the hand of Pr
ovidence that p
"unishes thee,’"
" I shall say,”"
" thought he, ima"
gining what he w
ould say when k
illing Napoleon.
" “Well then, t"
ake me and execu
te me!” he wen
"t on,
speaking "
to himself and b
owing his head w
ith a sad but fi
rm expression. 
"
While Pierre, "
standing in the 
middle of the ro
"om, was talking "
to himself in t
"his way, the stu"
dy door opened a
nd on the thresh
old appeared th
e figure of Mak�
"�r Alexéevich, "
always so timid 
before but now q
uite transforme
d.  His dressi
ng gown was unfa
"stened, his face"
 red and distort
ed. He was obvi
ously drunk. On 
seeing Pierre he
 grew confused a
"t first, but
no"
ticing embarrass
ment on Pierre�
�s face immediat
ely grew bold an
"d,
staggering o"
"n his thin legs,"
 advanced into t
he middle of the
 room.  “The
y’re frightene
"d,” he said co"
nfidentially in 
a hoarse voice. 
“I say I won�
"��t surrender, I"
 say... Am I not
" right, sir?”"
  He paused and
 then suddenly s
eeing the pistol
 on the table se
ized it with un
expected rapidit
y and ran out in
to the corridor.
  Gerásim and
" the porter, who"
 had followed Ma
kár Alexéevich
", stopped him
i"
n the vestibule 
and tried to tak
e the pistol fro
"m him. Pierre, c"
oming out into 
"the corridor, lo"
oked with pity a
nd repulsion at 
the half-crazy 
old man. Makár 
"Alexéevich, fro"
wning with exert
"ion, held on to "
the pistol and 
screamed hoarsel
"y, evidently wit"
h some heroic fa
ncy in his head.
  “To arms! 
"Board them! No, "
you shan’t get
" it,” he yelle"
d.  “That wi
"ll do, please, t"
hat will do. Hav
e the goodness�
"�please, sir, to"
 let go! Please
", sir...” plea"
"ded Gerásim, tr"
ying carefully t
o steer Makár 
Alexéevich by t
he elbows back t
o the door.  �
��Who are you? B
onaparte!...” 
shouted Makár A
lexéevich.  �
��That’s not r
"ight, sir. Come "
"to your room, pl"
"ease, and rest. "
Allow me to hav
e the pistol.”
"

“Be off, t"
hou base slave! 
Touch me not! Se
e this?” shout
ed Makár Alex�
"�evich, brandish"
ing the pistol. 
“Board them!�
�  “Catch ho
ld!” whispered
 Gerásim to the
 porter.  They
 seized Makár A
lexéevich by th
e arms and dragg
ed him to the do
or.  The vesti
bule was filled 
with the discord
ant sounds of a 
struggle and of 
"
a tipsy, hoarse"
 voice.  Sudde
nly a fresh soun
"d, a piercing fe"
"minine scream, r"
everberated from
 the porch and 
the cook came ru
nning into the v
estibule.  “
It’s them! Gra
cious heavens! O
" Lord, four of t"
"hem, horsemen!�"
� she cried.  
 Gerásim and th
e porter let Mak
ár Alexéevich 
"go, and in the n"
ow silent corri
dor the sound of
 several hands k
nocking at the f
ront door could 
be heard.   
   CHAPTER XX
"VIII

Pierre, "
having decided t
hat until he had
 carried out his
 design he would
 disclose neith
er his identity 
nor his knowledg
"e of French, sto"
od at the half-
open door of the
" corridor, inten"
ding to conceal 
himself as soon 
 as the French e
ntered. But the 
French entered a
nd still Pierre 
did not retire�
��an irresistibl
e curiosity kept
 him there.  T
here were two of
 them. One was a
n officer—a ta
"ll, soldierly, h"
andsome man—t
he other evident
ly a private or 
"an orderly, sunb"
"urned, short, an"
"d
thin, with su"
nken cheeks and 
a dull expressio
n. The officer w
"alked in
front,"
 leaning on a st
ick and slightly
 limping. When h
e had advanced 
a few steps he s
"topped, having a"
pparently decide
d that these wer
e good quarters
", turned round t"
o the soldiers s
tanding at the e
"ntrance, and in"
 a loud voice of
 command ordered
 them to put up 
the horses. Havi
"ng done
that, t"
"he officer, lift"
ing his elbow wi
th a smart gestu
"re, stroked his"
 mustache and li
ghtly touched hi
s hat.  “Bon
"jour, la compagn"
ie!” * said he
" gaily, smiling "
and looking abou
t him.      * 
"“Good day, eve"
rybody!”   
No one gave any 
reply.  “Vou
s êtes le bourg
eois?” * the o
fficer asked Ger
ásim.      * 
“Are you the m
aster here?” 
  Gerásim gaz
ed at the office
r with an alarme
d and inquiring 
look.  “Quar
"tier, quartier, "
logement!” sai
"d the officer, l"
ooking down at t
he little man w
ith a condescend
ing and good-nat
ured smile. “L
es français so
nt de bons enfan
ts. Que diable! 
Voyons! Ne nous 
"fâchons pas, mo"
n vieux!” * a
"dded he, clappin"
g the scared and
 silent Gerásim
 on the shoulde
"r. “Well, does"
 no one speak Fr
ench in this est
ablishment?” h
e asked again i
"n French, lookin"
g around and mee
ting Pierre’s 
eyes. Pierre mo
ved away from th
e door.       
"* “Quarters, q"
"uarters, lodging"
s! The French ar
e good      fel
lows. What the d
"evil! There, don"
’t let us be c
"ross, old
     "
fellow!”   
Again the office
r turned to Ger�
�sim and asked h
im to show him t
he rooms in the
 house.  “Ma
"ster, not here�"
�don’t underst
"and... me, you.."
.” said Gerás
"im, trying
to r"
ender his words 
more comprehensi
ble by contortin
g them.  Still
" smiling, the Fr"
ench officer spr
ead out his hand
s before Gerási
"m’s
nose, int"
imating that he 
did not understa
"nd him either, a"
"nd moved,
limpi"
"ng, to the door "
at which Pierre 
was standing. Pi
erre wished to g
o away and conc
"eal himself, but"
 at that moment 
he saw Makár Al
exéevich appea
ring at the open
 kitchen door wi
th the pistol in
 his hand. With 
 a madman’s cu
"nning, Makár Al"
exéevich eyed t
"he Frenchman, ra"
ised his pistol
", and took aim."
  “Board them
!” yelled the 
"tipsy man, tryin"
g to press the t
rigger. Hearing 
 the yell the of
ficer turned rou
"nd, and at the s"
ame moment Pierr
e threw himself
 on the drunkard
. Just when Pier
re snatched at a
nd struck up the
 pistol Makár 
Alexéevich at l
ast got his fing
ers on the trigg
"er, there
was a"
 deafening repor
"t, and all were "
enveloped in a c
loud of smoke. T
he Frenchman tu
rned pale and ru
shed to the door
.  Forgetting 
his intention of
 concealing his 
knowledge of Fre
"nch, Pierre,
sn"
atching away the
 pistol and thro
"wing it down, ra"
n up to the offi
cer and address
ed him in French
.  “You are 
not wounded?” 
he asked.  “
"I think not,” "
answered the Fre
"nchman, feeling "
himself over. �
�But I have had
 a lucky escape 
"this time,” he"
" added, pointing"
 to the damaged 
plaster of the 
wall. “Who is 
that man?” sai
"d he, looking st"
ernly at Pierre.
"

“Oh, I am "
really in despai
r at what has oc
"curred,” said "
"Pierre rapidly,"
 quite forgettin
g the part he ha
d intended to pl
ay. “He is an 
unfortunate mad
man who did not 
know what he was
 doing.”  Th
e officer went u
p to Makár Alex
éevich and took
 him by the coll
ar.  Makár Al
exéevich was st
anding with part
"ed lips, swaying"
", as if about to"
"
fall asleep, a"
s he leaned agai
nst the wall.  
 “Brigand! You
 shall pay for t
"his,” said the"
" Frenchman, lett"
ing go of him. 
“We French are
 merciful after 
"victory, but we "
do not pardon t
"raitors,” he a"
"dded, with a loo"
k of gloomy dign
ity and a fine e
nergetic gestur
e.  Pierre con
"tinued, in Frenc"
"h, to persuade t"
he officer not t
o hold that dru
nken imbecile to
 account. The Fr
enchman listened
 in silence with
 the same gloom
"y expression, bu"
t suddenly turne
d to Pierre with
 a smile. For a
 few seconds he 
looked at him in
 silence. His ha
ndsome face assu
med a melodrama
tically gentle e
xpression and he
 held out his ha
nd.  “You ha
ve saved my life
. You are French
",” said he.
"
 For a Frenchman
 that deduction 
was indubitable.
 Only a Frenchma
n could perform
" a great deed, a"
nd to save his l
ife—the life o
"f M. Ramballe,
"
captain of the 1
3th Light Regime
nt—was undoubt
edly a very grea
t deed.  But h
owever indubitab
le that conclusi
on and the offic
er’s convictio
n based upon it
", Pierre felt it"
 necessary to di
sillusion him. 
 “I am Russia
"n,” he said qu"
ickly.  “Tut
", tut, tut! Tell"
" that to others,"
” said the off
"icer, waving his"
 finger before 
his nose and smi
ling. “You sha
ll tell me all a
bout that prese
ntly. I am delig
hted to meet a c
"ompatriot. Well,"
 and what are we
 to do with thi
s man?” he add
"ed, addressing h"
imself to Pierre
 as to a brothe
r.  Even if Pi
erre were not a 
"Frenchman, havin"
g once received 
that loftiest o
f human appellat
ions he could no
"t renounce it, s"
aid the officer�
��s look and to
ne. In reply to 
his last questio
n Pierre again e
xplained who Mak
ár Alexéevich
 was and how jus
t before their a
rrival that drun
ken imbecile ha
d seized the loa
ded pistol which
 they had not ha
d time to recove
"r from
him, and"
 begged the offi
cer to let the d
eed go unpunishe
d.  The French
man expanded his
 chest and made 
a majestic gestu
re with his arm
.  “You have
 saved my life! 
You are French. 
You ask his pard
on? I grant it 
you. Lead that m
an away!” said
 he quickly and 
"energetically, a"
nd taking the a
rm of Pierre who
m he had promote
d to be a French
man for saving h
"is
life, he wen"
t with him into 
the room.  The
 soldiers in the
" yard, hearing t"
"he shot, came in"
to the passage a
sking what had 
"happened, and ex"
pressed their re
adiness to punis
"h the culprits,"
 but the officer
 sternly checked
 them.  “You
 will be called 
in when you are 
"wanted,” he sa"
id.  The soldi
ers went out aga
"in, and the orde"
"rly, who had mea"
nwhile had time 
 to visit the ki
"tchen, came up t"
o his officer. 
"
“Captain, th"
ere is soup and 
a leg of mutton 
"in the kitchen,�"
�� said he. “
Shall I serve th
em up?”  “
"Yes, and some wi"
"ne,” answered "
the captain.  
    CHAPTER 
XXIX  When the
 French officer 
went into the ro
om with Pierre t
he latter again 
 thought it his 
duty to assure h
im that he was n
ot French and wi
shed to go away
", but the office"
r would not hear
 of it. He was s
"o very polite,
"
"amiable, good-na"
"tured, and genui"
nely grateful to
 Pierre for savi
ng his life tha
t Pierre had not
 the heart to re
"fuse, and sat do"
wn with him in 
the parlor—the
 first room they
 entered. To Pie
rre’s assuranc
es that he was 
"not a Frenchman,"
" the captain, ev"
idently not unde
rstanding how an
yone could decl
ine so flatterin
g an appellation
", shrugged his s"
houlders and sa
id that if Pierr
e absolutely ins
isted on passing
 for a Russian l
"et it
be so, bu"
t for all that h
e would be forev
er bound to Pier
re by gratitude 
 for saving his 
life.  Had thi
s man been endow
ed with the slig
htest capacity f
or perceiving th
e feelings of o
"thers, and had h"
e at all underst
ood what Pierre�
��s feelings we
"re, the latter w"
ould probably ha
"ve left him, but"
 the man’s ani
mated obtusenes
s to everything 
other than himse
lf disarmed Pier
re.  “A Fren
chman or a Russi
an prince incogn
"ito,” said the"
" officer, lookin"
g at Pierre’s
 fine though dir
ty linen and at 
the ring on his 
finger. “I ow
e my life to you
 and offer you m
y friendship. A 
Frenchman never 
 forgets either 
an insult or a s
ervice. I offer 
you my friendshi
p. That is all 
I can say.”  
 There was so mu
ch good nature a
nd nobility (in 
the French sense
 of the word) i
n the officer’
"s voice, in the "
expression of hi
s face and in h
"is gestures, tha"
"t Pierre, uncons"
ciously smiling 
in response to t
he Frenchman’
"s smile, pressed"
 the hand held o
ut to him.  �
�Captain Ramball

 for the affair

"f September,” "
he introduced h
"imself, a self-s"
atisfied irrepre
ssible smile puc
kering his lips 
under his musta

as to tell me wi
th whom I have 
the honor of con
versing so pleas
"antly, instead o"
f being in the a
mbulance with t

ullet in my body
?”  Pierre r
eplied that he c
ould not tell hi
"m his name and, "
"blushing,
began"
 to try to inven
t a name and to 
say something ab
out his reason f
or concealing i
"t, but the Frenc"
hman hastily int
errupted him.  
"
“Oh, please!�"
�� said he. “I

is enough for me
. I am quite at

oncluded with a

t’s all I wan
t to know.”  
 When the mutton
 and an omelet h
ad been served a
nd a samovar and
" vodka
brought,"
 with some wine 
which the French
 had taken from 
a Russian cellar
 and brought wi
"th them, Ramball"
e invited Pierre
 to share his di
"nner, and
himse"
lf began to eat 
greedily and qui
ckly like a heal
thy and hungry m
"an,
munching hi"
s food rapidly w
ith his strong t
"eeth, continuall"
y smacking his 
"lips, and repeat"
ing—“Excelle
nt! Delicious!�
� His face grew 
red and was cov
ered with perspi
ration. Pierre w
as hungry and sh
ared the dinner 
 with pleasure. 
"Morel, the order"
"ly, brought some"
 hot water in a 
saucepan and pl
aced a bottle of
 claret in it. H
e also brought a
 bottle of kvass
",
taken from th"
e kitchen for th
em to try. That 
beverage was alr
eady known to t
he French and ha
d been given a s
pecial name. The
y called it limo
nade de cochon 
(pig’s lemonad
"e), and Morel sp"
oke well of the 
limonade de coc
hon he had found
 in the kitchen.
 But as the capt
ain had the wine
 they had taken
 while passing t
"hrough Moscow, h"
e left the kvass
 to Morel and a
pplied himself t
o the bottle of 
Bordeaux. He wra
pped the bottle 
up to its neck 
in a table napki
n and poured out
 wine for himsel
f and for Pierr
e. The satisfact
ion of his hunge
r and the wine r
endered the capt
ain still more 
lively and he ch
atted incessantl
y all through di
"nner.

“Yes,"
 my dear Monsieu
"r Pierre, I owe "
you a fine votiv
e candle for sa
ving me from tha
t maniac.... You
" see, I have bul"
lets enough in m
y body already.
 Here is one I g
ot at Wagram” 
(he touched his 
side) “and a 
second at Smolé
nsk”—he show
ed a scar on his
 cheek—“and 
this leg which a
s you see does 
not want to marc
"h, I got that on"
 the seventh at 
the great battl
e of la Moskowa.
 Sacré Dieu! It
 was splendid! T
hat deluge of fi

ough job you set

proud of it! And
" on my honor, in"

"�I was there,”"
 said Pierre.  
"
“Bah, really?"
 So much the bet
ter! You are cer
tainly brave foe
s. The great re
doubt held out w
"ell, by my pipe!"
” continued th
e Frenchman. “
And you made us
 pay dear for it
. I was at it th
ree times—sure
 as I sit here. 
 Three times we

I saw them close

" what’s what, "
cried ‘Bravo!�
"�� Ha, ha! So yo"

" added, smiling,"
 after a momenta
ry pause. “So

", “that’s wh"

ptain was so na�
�vely and good-h
"umoredly gay, so"
" real, and so
p"
leased with hims
elf that Pierre 
almost winked ba
ck as he looked 
merrily at him.
 Probably the wo
rd “gallant”
 turned the capt
ain’s thoughts
 to the state o
f Moscow.  “
"Apropos, tell me"
" please, is it t"
rue that the wom
en have all left
 Moscow? What a
 queer idea! Wha
t had they to be
 afraid of?” 
 “Would not t
he French ladies
 leave Paris if 
the Russians ent
ered it?” ask
ed Pierre.  �
"�Ha, ha, ha!” "
The Frenchman em
"itted a merry, s"
"anguine chuckle,"
 patting Pierre
 on the shoulder
. “What a thin
g to say!” he 
exclaimed. “Pa
ris?... But Par
"is, Paris...”"
  “Paris—th
e capital of the
" world,” Pierr"
e finished his r
emark for him. 
 The captain lo
oked at Pierre. 
He had a habit o
f stopping short
 in the middle 
of his talk and 
gazing intently 
with his laughin
"g, kindly eyes."
"

“Well, if y"
ou hadn’t told
 me you were Rus
"sian, I should h"
ave wagered tha
t you were Paris
ian! You have th
at... I don’t 
"know what, that."
..” and havin
g uttered this c
"ompliment, he ag"
ain gazed at him
 in silence.  
“I have been i
n Paris. I spent
" years there,”"
 said Pierre.  
"
“Oh yes, one "
sees that plainl
y. Paris!... A m
an who doesn’t

a savage. You ca

noticing that h

ckly: “There 
is only one Pari

You have been to
 Paris and have 
 remained Russia
"n. Well, I don�"

e less for it.�
�  Under the i
nfluence of the 
wine he had drun
"k, and after the"
 days he had sp
ent alone with h
is depressing th
"oughts, Pierre i"
nvoluntarily enj
oyed talking wi
th this cheerful
 and good-nature
d man.  “To 
return to your l
adies—I hear t

What a wretched

"We are feared, b"

 We are nice to 
 know. And then 
the Emperor...�
"� he began, but "
Pierre interrupt
ed him.  “Th
"e Emperor,” Pi"

nd his face sudd
enly became sad 
and embarrassed
", “is the Empe"

�The Emperor? He

 of the grandeur
 and glory with 
which he has cov

en I understood 
what he wanted�
�when I saw that
 he was preparin

 and I devoted 
myself to him! S
"o there! Oh yes,"
" mon cher, he is"
 the greatest m
an of the ages p
ast or future.�
�  “Is he in
 Moscow?” Pier
re stammered wit
h a guilty look.
  The Frenchma
n looked at his 
guilty face and 
smiled.  “No
", he will make h"
is entry tomorro
"w,” he replied"
", and continued "
his talk.  Th
eir conversation
 was interrupted
 by the cries of
 several voices 
at the gate and
" by Morel, who c"
ame to say that 
some Württember
g hussars had c
ome and wanted t
o put up their h
orses in the yar
d where the capt
ain’s horses 
were. This diffi
culty had arisen
 chiefly because
 the hussars did
 not understand
 what was said t
o them in French
.  The captain
 had their senio
r sergeant calle
"d in, and in a s"
tern voice aske
d him to what re
giment he belong
"ed, who was his "
commanding offic
"er,
and by what"
 right he allowe
d himself to cla
im quarters that
 were already o
ccupied. The Ger
man who knew lit
"tle French, answ"
ered the two fir
st questions by
 giving the name
s of his regimen
t and of his com
manding officer
", but in reply t"
o the third ques
tion which he di
d not understand
"
said, introduc"
ing broken Frenc
h into his own G
"erman, that he w"
as the quarterm
aster of the reg
iment and his co
mmander had orde
red him to occu
py all the house
s one after anot
"her. Pierre, who"
" knew German,
t"
ranslated what t
he German said t
o the captain an
d gave the capta
in’s reply to
 the Württember
g hussar in Germ
an. When he had 
understood what 
 was said to him
", the German sub"
mitted and took 
his men elsewher
e. The captain 
went out into th
e porch and gave
 some orders in 
a loud voice.  
 When he returne
d to the room Pi
erre was sitting
 in the same pla
"ce as
before, w"
ith his head in 
his hands. His f
ace expressed su
ffering. He rea
lly was sufferin
g at that moment
. When the capta
in went out and 
he was left alo
"ne, suddenly he "
came to himself 
and realized the
 position he wa
s in. It was not
 that Moscow had
 been taken or t
hat the happy c
onquerors were m
asters in it and
 were patronizin
g him. Painful a
s that was it w
as not that whic
h tormented Pier
re at the moment
. He was tormen
ted by the consc
iousness of his 
own weakness. Th
e few glasses of
 wine he had dr
unk and the conv
ersation with th
is good-natured 
man had destroy
ed the mood of c
oncentrated gloo
m in which he ha
d spent the last
 few days and w
hich was essenti
al for the execu
tion of his desi
"gn. The
pistol,"
" dagger, and pea"
sant coat were r
eady. Napoleon w
as to enter the 
 town next day. 
Pierre still con
sidered that it 
would be a usefu
l and worthy ac
tion to slay the
" evildoer, but n"
ow he felt that 
he would not do
 it. He did not 
"know why, but he"
 felt a forebodi
ng that he would
 not carry out 
his intention. H
e struggled agai
nst the confessi
on of his weakn
ess but dimly fe
lt that he could
 not overcome it
 and that his f
ormer gloomy fra
"me of mind, conc"
erning vengeance
", killing, and
"
"self-sacrifice, "
had been dispers
ed like dust by 
contact with the
 first man he m
et.  The capta
in returned to t
"he room, limping"
 slightly and wh
istling a tune. 
  The Frenchman
’s chatter whi
ch had previousl
y amused Pierre 
now repelled hi
m. The tune he w
"as whistling, hi"
"s gait, and the "
gesture with whi
ch he twirled h
"is mustache, all"
 now seemed offe
nsive. “I will
 go away immedi
ately. I won’t
 say another wor
"d to him,” tho"
ught Pierre. He 
"
thought this, b"
ut still sat in 
the same place. 
A strange feelin
g of weakness t
ied him to the s
pot; he wished t
o get up and go 
"away, but
could"
 not do so.  T
"he captain, on t"
"he other hand, s"
eemed very cheer
ful. He paced up
 and down the r
oom twice. His e
yes shone and hi
s mustache twitc
hed as if he we
re smiling to hi
mself at some am
using thought. 
 “The colonel
 of those Württ
embergers is del
"ightful,” he s"
uddenly said. �
��He’s a Germa
"n, but a nice fe"
llow all the sam
e.... But he’s
 a German.” H
e sat down facin
g Pierre. “By 
"the way, you kno"
"w German, then?�"
��  Pierre loo
ked at him in si
lence.  “Wha
t is the German 
for ‘shelter�
�?”  “Shel
ter?” Pierre r
epeated. “The 
German for shelt
er is Unterkunft
.”  “How d
o you say it?”
 the captain ask
ed quickly and d
oubtfully.  �
"�Unterkunft,” "
Pierre repeated.
  “Onterkoff
",” said the ca"
ptain and looked
 at Pierre for s
ome seconds with
 laughing eyes.
 “These German
s are first-rate
" fools, don’t "
"you think so,
M"
onsieur Pierre?�
�� he concluded.
"

“Well, let"
’s have anothe
r bottle of this
 Moscow Bordeaux
", shall we?
Mor"
el will warm us 
up another littl
e bottle. Morel!
” he called ou
t gaily.  Mor
el brought candl
es and a bottle 
of wine. The cap
tain looked at P
ierre by the ca
ndlelight and wa
s evidently stru
ck by the troubl
ed expression o
n his companion�
��s face. Rambal
"le, with genuine"
 distress and sy
mpathy in his f
"ace, went up to "
Pierre and bent 
over him.  “
"There now, we’"
"re sad,” said "
"he, touching Pie"
rre’s hand. �
�Have I upset y
"ou? No, really, "
have you anythin
g against me?”
 he asked Pierre
. “Perhaps it
’s the state o
f affairs?”  
 Pierre did not 
"answer, but look"
ed cordially int
o the Frenchman�
��s eyes whose 
expression of sy
mpathy was pleas
ing to him.  �
"��Honestly, with"
out speaking of 
"what I owe you, "
I feel friendshi
p for you. Can 
I do anything fo
r you? Dispose o
f me. It is for 
life and death. 
 I say it with m
y hand on my hea
"rt!” said he, "
striking his che
st.  “Thank 
"you,” said Pie"
rre.  The capt
ain gazed intent
ly at him as he 
had done when he
 learned that �
��shelter” was
 Unterkunft in G
"erman, and his f"
ace suddenly bri
ghtened.  “W
"ell, in that cas"
"e, I drink to ou"
r friendship!”
" he cried gaily,"
 filling two gl
asses with wine.
  Pierre took 
one of the glass
es and emptied i
t. Ramballe empt
"ied his too,
ag"
ain pressed Pier
"re’s hand, and"
 leaned his elbo
ws on the table 
in a pensive at
titude.  “Ye
"s, my dear frien"
"d,” he began, "
“such is fortu
ne’s caprice. 
Who would have 
said that I shou
ld be a soldier 
and a captain of
 dragoons in the
 service of Bon
"aparte, as we us"
ed to call him? 
Yet here I am in
 Moscow with hi
m. I must tell y
"ou, mon cher,”"
 he continued in
 the sad and me
asured tones of 
a man who intend
s to tell a long
" story, “that "
our name is one
 of the most anc
ient in France.�
��  And with a
 Frenchman’s e
asy and naïve f
rankness the cap
tain told Pierre
 the story of h
"is ancestors, hi"
"s childhood, you"
"th, and manhood,"
 and all about 
his relations an
d his financial 
and family affai
"rs, “ma pauvre"
 mère” playi
ng of course an 
important part i
n the story.  
“But all that 
is only life’s
" setting, the re"
al thing is love
—love! Am I n
"ot right, Monsie"
ur Pierre?” sa
"id he, growing a"
nimated. “Anot
her glass?”  
 Pierre again em
ptied his glass 
and poured himse
lf out a third. 
"

“Oh, women,"
 women!” and t
"he captain, look"
ing with glisten
ing eyes at Pie
"rre, began talki"
ng of love and o
f his love affai
rs.  There wer
e very many of t
"hese, as one cou"
ld easily believ
"e, looking
at t"
he officer’s h
"andsome, self-sa"
"tisfied face, an"
d noting the eag
er enthusiasm w
ith which he spo
ke of women. Tho
ugh all Ramballe
’s love stori
es had the sensu
al character whi
ch Frenchmen reg
ard as the speci
al charm and po
"etry of love, ye"
t he told his st
ory with such si
ncere convictio
n that he alone 
had experienced 
and known all th
e charm of love 
 and he describe
d women so allur
ingly that Pierr
e listened to hi
m with curiosit
y.  It was pla
in that l’amou
r which the Fren
chman was so fon
d of was not th
at low and simpl
e kind that Pier
re had once felt
" for his wife, n"
or was it the r
omantic love sti
mulated by himse
lf that he exper
ienced for Nat�
�sha. (Ramballe 
despised both th
ese kinds of lov
e equally: the o
ne he considere
d the “love of
 clodhoppers” 
and the other th
e “love of si
mpletons.”) L�
��amour which th
e Frenchman wors
hiped consisted 
 principally in 
the unnaturalnes
s of his relatio
n to the woman a
nd in a combina
tion of incongru
ities giving the
 chief charm to 
the feeling.  
Thus the captain
 touchingly reco
unted the story 
of his love for 
a fascinating m
arquise of thirt
y-five and at th
e same time for 
"a charming,
inn"
ocent child of s
"eventeen, daught"
er of the bewitc
hing marquise. T
he conflict of 
magnanimity betw
een the mother a
"nd the daughter,"
 ending in the 
mother’s sacri
ficing herself a
nd offering her 
daughter in marr
iage to her lov
"er, even now agi"
tated the captai
"n, though it was"
 the memory of 
a distant past. 
Then he recounte
d an episode in 
which the husban
d played the pa
"rt of the lover,"
 and he—the lo
ver—assumed th
e role of the hu
"sband,
as well "
as several droll
 incidents from 
his recollection
"s of Germany,
w"
here “shelter�
�� is called Unt
erkunft and wher
e the husbands e
at sauerkraut a
nd the young gir
ls are “too bl
onde.”  Fina
"lly, the latest "
episode in Polan
d still fresh in
 the captain’s
"
memory, and wh"
ich he narrated 
with rapid gestu
res and glowing 
"face, was
of ho"
w he had saved t
he life of a Pol
"e (in general, t"
he saving of li
fe continually o
ccurred in the c
aptain’s stori
es) and the Pole
 had entrusted 
to him his encha
nting wife (pari
sienne de cœur)
 while himself 
entering the Fre
nch service. The
 captain was hap
"py, the enchanti"
ng Polish lady 
wished to elope 
"with him, but, p"
rompted by magna
"nimity, the
cap"
tain restored th
e wife to the hu
"sband, saying as"
 he did so: “I
 have saved you
"r life, and I sa"
ve your honor!�
� Having repeate
d these words th
e captain wiped
 his eyes and ga
ve himself a sha
"ke, as if drivin"
g away the weak
ness which assai
led him at this 
touching recolle
ction.  Listen
ing to the capta
"in’s tales, Pi"
erre—as often 
happens late in 
the evening and
 under the influ
ence of wine—f
ollowed all that
" was told him,
"
understood it al
"l, and at the sa"
me time followed
 a train of pers
onal memories w
"hich, he knew no"
"t why, suddenly "
arose in his min
d. While listen
ing to these lov
e stories his ow
n love for Natá
sha unexpectedly
 rose to his mi
"nd, and going ov"
er the pictures 
of that love in 
his imagination
 he mentally com
pared them with 
Ramballe’s tal
es. Listening t
o the story of t
he struggle betw
een love and dut
"y, Pierre saw be"
fore his eyes e
very minutest de
tail of his last
 meeting with th
e object of his
 love at the Sú
kharev water tow
er. At the time 
of that meeting 
it had not prod
uced an effect u
pon him—he had
 not even once r
ecalled it. But 
 now it seemed t
o him that that 
meeting had had 
in it something 
very important 
and poetic.  �
��Peter Kirílov
"ich, come here! "
We have recogniz
"ed you,” he no"
w seemed to hea
r the words she 
had uttered and 
to see before hi
"m her eyes, her"
"
smile, her trav"
"eling hood, and "
a stray lock of 
her hair... and 
there seemed to
 him something p
athetic and touc
hing in all this
.  Having fini
shed his tale ab
out the enchanti
"ng Polish lady, "
the captain ask
ed Pierre if he 
had ever experie
nced a similar i
mpulse to sacrif
ice himself for
 love and a feel
ing of envy of t
he legitimate hu
sband.  Challe
nged by this que
stion Pierre rai
sed his head and
 felt a need to 
 express the tho
ughts that fille
d his mind. He b
egan to explain 
that he underst
ood love for a w
oman somewhat di
fferently. He sa
id that in all 
his life he had 
loved and still 
loved only one w
"oman, and that s"
he could never 
be his.  “Ti
ens!” said the
 captain.  Pie
rre then explain
ed that he had l
oved this woman 
from his earlies
"t
years, but th"
at he had not da
red to think of 
her because she 
"was too
young, "
and because he h
ad been an illeg
itimate son with
out a name. Aft
erwards when he 
had received a n
ame and wealth h
e dared not thin
k of her becaus
e he loved her t
"oo well, placing"
 her far above e
verything in th
"e world, and esp"
ecially therefor
e above himself.
  When he had 
reached this poi
"nt, Pierre asked"
 the captain whe
ther he underst
ood that.  The
 captain made a 
gesture signifyi
ng that even if 
he did not under
stand it he beg
ged Pierre to co
ntinue.  “Pl
"atónic love, cl"
ouds...” he mu
ttered.  Wheth
er it was the wi
"ne he had drunk,"
 or an impulse o
"f frankness, or "
the thought tha
t this man did n
"ot, and never wo"
"uld, know any of"
 those who play
ed a part in his
" story, or wheth"
er it was all th
ese things toget
"her,
something "
loosened Pierre�
��s tongue. Spea
king thickly and
 with a faraway 
 look in his shi
"ning eyes, he to"
ld the whole sto
ry of his life: 
"his
marriage, N"
atásha’s love
 for his best fr
"iend, her betray"
"al of him, and
"
all his own simp
le relations wit
h her. Urged on 
by Ramballe’s 
questions he al
so told what he 
had at first con
cealed—his own
 position and ev
en his name.  
 More than anyth
ing else in Pier
re’s story the
 captain was imp
ressed by the f
act that Pierre 
"was very rich, h"
ad two mansions 
"in Moscow, and t"
hat he had aban
doned everything
 and not left th
"e city, but rema"
ined there conc
ealing his name 
and station.  
When it was late
 at night they w
ent out together
 into the street
. The night was
 warm and light.
 To the left of 
the house on the
 Pokróvka a fi
re glowed—the 
first of those t
hat were beginni
ng in Moscow. To
 the right and 
high up in the s
ky was the sickl
e of the waning 
moon and opposi
te to it hung th
at bright comet 
which was connec
ted in Pierre’
s heart with hi
s love. At the g
ate stood Gerás
"im, the cook, an"
d two Frenchmen
. Their laughter
 and their mutua
lly incomprehens
ible remarks in 
 two languages c
ould be heard. T
hey were looking
 at the glow see
n in the town. 
  There was not
hing terrible in
" the one small, "
distant fire in 
the immense cit
y.  Gazing at 
the high starry 
"sky, at the moon"
", at the comet, "
and at the glow
" from the fire, "
Pierre experienc
ed a joyful emot
ion. “There no
"w,
how good it "
"is, what more do"
es one need?” 
thought he. And 
suddenly rememb
ering his intent
ion he grew dizz
y and felt so fa
int that he lean
ed against the 
fence to save hi
mself from falli
ng.  Without t
aking leave of h
"is new friend, P"
ierre left the g
ate with unstea
dy steps and ret
urning to his ro
om lay down on t
he sofa and imm
ediately fell as
leep.      
 CHAPTER XXX  
The glow of the 
first fire that 
began on the sec
ond of September
 was watched fr
om the various r
oads by the fugi
tive Muscovites 
and by the retr
"eating troops, w"
ith many differe
nt feelings.  
The Rostóv part
y spent the nigh
"t at Mytíshchi,"
 fourteen miles 
from Moscow. Th
ey had started s
o late on the fi
rst of September
", the road
had "
been so blocked 
by vehicles and 
"troops, so many "
things had been 
 forgotten for w
hich servants we
"re sent back, th"
at they had deci
ded to spend th
at night at a pl
ace three miles 
out of Moscow. T
he next morning 
 they woke late 
and were again d
elayed so often 
that they only g
ot as far as Gr
eat Mytíshchi. 
At ten o’clock
 that evening th
e Rostóv family
 and the wounde
d traveling with
 them were all d
istributed in th
e yards and hut
s of that large 
village. The Ros
tóvs’ servant
s and coachmen a
nd the orderlie
s of the wounded
" officers, after"
 attending to th
"eir masters, had"
"
supper, fed th"
"e horses, and ca"
me out into the 
porches.  In a
 neighboring hut
 lay Raévski’
s adjutant with 
a fractured wris
t. The awful pa
in he suffered m
ade him moan inc
essantly and pit
"eously, and his"
 moaning sounded
 terrible in the
 darkness of the
 autumn night. H
e had spent the
 first night in 
the same yard as
 the Rostóvs. T
he countess said
 she had been u
nable to close h
er eyes on accou
nt of his moanin
"g, and at
Mytí"
shchi she moved 
into a worse hut
 simply to be fa
rther away from 
the wounded man
.  In the dark
ness of the nigh
t one of the ser
"vants noticed, a"
bove the high b
ody of a coach s
tanding before t
"he porch, the sm"
all glow of anot
her fire. One g
low had long bee
n visible and ev
erybody knew tha
t it was Little
 Mytíshchi burn
ing—set on fir
e by Mamónov’
s Cossacks.  �
"��But look here,"
" brothers, there"
’s another fir
e!” remarked a
n orderly.  Al
l turned their a
ttention to the 
glow.  “But 
they told us Lit
tle Mytíshchi h
ad been set on f
ire by Mamónov�
��s Cossacks.�
�  “But that
’s not Mytísh
"chi, it’s fart"
her away.”  
"“Look, it must"
 be in Moscow!�
�  Two of the 
gazers went roun
d to the other s
ide of the coach
 and sat down o
n its steps.  
“It’s more t
"o the left, why,"
 Little Mytíshc
hi is over there
", and this is
r"
ight on the othe
r side.”  Se
veral men joined
 the first two. 
  “See how it
"’s flaring,”"
 said one. “Th
at’s a fire in
 Moscow: either 
in the Sushché
vski or the Rog�
�zhski quarter.�
��  No one rep
lied to this rem
ark and for some
 time they all g
azed silently a
t the spreading 
flames of the se
cond fire in the
 distance.  Ol
d Daniel Terént
"ich, the count�"
�s valet (as he 
"was called), cam"
e up to the gro
up and shouted a
t Míshka.  �
�What are you st
"aring at, you go"
od-for-nothing?.
.. The count wil
l be calling an
d there’s nobo
dy there; go and
 gather the clot
hes together.”
  “I only ra
n out to get som
"e water,” said"
 Míshka.  “
But what do you 
"think, Daniel Te"
réntich? Doesn�
��t it look as i
f that glow wer
e in Moscow?” 
remarked one of 
the footmen.  
Daniel Teréntic
"h made no reply,"
 and again for a
 long time they 
were all silent
. The glow sprea
"d, rising and fa"
"lling, farther a"
nd farther still
.  “God have
 mercy.... It’
s windy and dry.
..” said anoth
er voice.  “
Just look! See w
hat it’s doing
 now. O Lord! Yo
u can even see t
he crows flying
. Lord have merc
y on us sinners!
”  “They�
"�ll put it out, "
no fear!”  �
��Who’s to put
 it out?” Dani
"el Teréntich, w"
ho had hitherto 
"been silent,
wa"
s heard to say. 
His voice was ca
lm and deliberat
e. “Moscow it 
"is,
brothers,�"
� said he. “Mo
"ther Moscow, the"
 white...” his
" voice faltered,"
 and he gave wa
y to an old man�
��s sob.  And 
it was as if the
y had all only w
aited for this t
o realize the s
ignificance for 
them of the glow
 they were watch
ing. Sighs were 
"heard,
words of"
" prayer, and the"
 sobbing of the 
count’s old va
let.      
CHAPTER XXXI  
"The valet, retur"
ning to the cott
"age, informed th"
e count that Mos
cow was burning
. The count donn
ed his dressing 
gown and went ou
t to look. Sóny
a and Madame Sc
"hoss, who had no"
"t yet undressed,"
 went out with h
im. Only Natás
ha and the count
ess remained in 
the room. Pétya
 was no longer 
"with the family,"
 he had gone on 
with his regimen
t which was maki
ng for Tróitsa
.  The countes
"s, on hearing th"
at Moscow was on
" fire, began to "
"cry. Natásha,
"
"pale, with a fix"
"ed look, was sit"
ting on the benc
h under the icon
s just where sh
e had sat down o
n arriving and p
aid no attention
 to her father�
�s words. She w
as listening to 
the ceaseless mo
aning of the adj
"utant, three
ho"
uses off.  “
"Oh, how terrible"
",” said Sónya"
 returning from 
the yard chilled
 and frightened
. “I believe t
he whole of Mosc
"ow will burn, th"
ere’s an awful
 glow! Natásha
", do look! You c"
an see it from t
"he window,” sh"
e said to her c
"ousin, evidently"
 wishing to dist
ract her mind. 
 But Natásha l
ooked at her as 
if not understan
ding what was sa
id to her and a
gain fixed her e
yes on the corne
r of the stove. 
She had been in 
 this condition 
of stupor since 
"the morning, whe"
"n Sónya, to the"
 surprise and a
nnoyance of the 
"countess, had fo"
r some unaccount
able reason foun
d it necessary 
to tell Natásha
 of Prince Andre
w’s wound and 
of his being wi
th their party. 
The countess had
 seldom been so 
angry with anyon
e as she was wi
th Sónya. Sóny
a had cried and 
begged to be for
"given and now,
"
as if trying to 
atone for her fa
"ult, paid unceas"
ing attention to
 her cousin.  
"
“Look, Natás"
"ha, how dreadful"
ly it is burning
!” said she. 
 “What’s bu
rning?” asked 
"Natásha. “Oh,"
" yes, Moscow.”"
  And as if in
 order not to of
fend Sónya and 
to get rid of he
"r, she turned
h"
er face to the w
"indow, looked ou"
t in such a way 
that it was evid
ent that she co
uld not see anyt
"hing, and again "
settled down in 
her former atti
tude.  “But 
you didn’t see
 it!”  “Ye
"s, really I did,"
” Natásha rep
lied in a voice 
that pleaded to 
be left in peac
e.  Both the c
ountess and Són
ya understood th
"at, naturally, n"
either Moscow n
or the burning o
f Moscow nor any
thing else could
 seem of importa
nce to Natásha
.  The count r
eturned and lay 
down behind the 
partition. The c
ountess went up
 to her daughter
 and touched her
 head with the b
ack of her hand 
as she was wont
 to do when Nat�
"�sha was ill, th"
en touched her f
orehead with her
 lips as if to 
feel whether she
" was feverish, a"
nd finally kisse
d her.  “You
 are cold. You a
re trembling all
 over. You’d b
"etter lie down,�"
�� said the cou
ntess.  “Lie
 down? All right
", I will. I’ll"
 lie down at onc
"e,” said Natá"
sha.  When Nat
ásha had been t
old that morning
 that Prince And
rew was seriousl
y wounded and w
as traveling wit
"h their party, s"
he had at first 
asked many ques
tions: Where was
 he going? How w
as he wounded? W
as it serious? A
nd could she se
e him? But after
 she had been to
ld that she coul
"d not see
him, "
that he was seri
ously wounded bu
t that his life 
was not in dange
"r,
she ceased t"
o ask questions 
or to speak at a
"ll, evidently di"
sbelieving what
" they told her, "
and convinced th
at say what she 
might she would 
 still be told t
he same. All the
 way she had sat
 motionless in a
 corner of the 
coach with wide 
"open eyes, and t"
he expression in
 them which the 
 countess knew s
o well and feare
"d so much, and n"
ow she sat in th
e same way on t
he bench where s
he had seated he
rself on arrivin
g. She was plan
ning something a
nd either decidi
ng or had alread
y decided someth
ing in her mind
. The countess k
"new this, but wh"
at it might be s
he did not know
", and this alarm"
ed and tormented
 her.  “Nat�
"�sha, undress, d"
arling; lie down
 on my bed.” 
 A bed had been
 made on a bedst
ead for the coun
tess only. Madam
e Schoss and th
e two girls were
 to sleep on som
e hay on the flo
"or.

“No, Ma"
"mma, I will lie "
down here on the
" floor,” Natá"
sha replied irr
itably and she w
ent to the windo
w and opened it.
 Through the ope
n window the mo
ans of the adjut
ant could be hea
rd more distinct
ly. She put her
 head out into t
he damp night ai
"r, and the count"
ess saw her slim
 neck shaking w
ith sobs and thr
obbing against t
he window frame.
 Natásha knew 
it was not Princ
e Andrew who was
 moaning. She kn
ew Prince Andrew
 was in the sam
e yard as themse
lves and in a pa
rt of the hut ac
ross the passage
; but this drea
dful incessant m
oaning made her 
sob. The countes
s exchanged a l
ook with Sónya.
"

“Lie down,"
 darling; lie do
"wn, my pet,” s"
aid the countess
", softly
touchi"
ng Natásha’s 
shoulders. “Co
"me, lie down.”"
"

“Oh, yes.."
. I’ll lie dow
"n at once,” sa"
"id Natásha, and"
 began hurriedly
"
undressing, tu"
gging at the tap
es of her pettic
oat.  When she
 had thrown off 
her dress and pu
t on a dressing 
"jacket, she sat"
 down with her f
oot under her on
 the bed that ha
d been made up o
"n the
floor, je"
rked her thin an
d rather short p
lait of hair to 
"the front,
and "
began replaiting
" it. Her long, t"
"hin, practiced f"
ingers rapidly 
"unplaited, repla"
"ited, and tied u"
p her plait. Her
 head moved from
 side to side f
"rom habit, but h"
"er eyes, feveris"
"hly wide, looked"
 fixedly before 
 her. When her t
oilet for the ni
ght was finished
 she sank gently
 onto the sheet
 spread over the
 hay on the side
 nearest the doo
r.  “Natásh
"a, you’d bette"
r lie in the mid
"dle,” said Só"
nya.  “I’l
"l stay here,” "
muttered Natásh
a. “Do lie dow
"n,” she added "
"crossly,
and bu"
ried her face in
 the pillow.  
"The countess, Ma"
"dame Schoss, and"
 Sónya undresse
d hastily and la
y down. The sma
ll lamp in front
 of the icons wa
s the only light
 left in the ro
om. But in the y
ard there was a 
light from the f
ire at Little M
ytíshchi a mile
 and a half away
", and through th"
e night came the
 noise of peopl
e shouting at a 
tavern Mamónov�
��s Cossacks had
 set up across t
"he
street, and "
the adjutant’s
 unceasing moans
 could still be 
heard.  For a 
long time Natás
ha listened atte
ntively to the s
ounds that reach
ed her from ins
ide and outside 
the room and did
 not move. First
 she heard her 
mother praying a
nd sighing and t
he creaking of h
er bed under he
"r, then Madame S"
choss’ familia
r whistling snor
e and Sónya’s
 gentle breathi
ng. Then the cou
ntess called to 
Natásha. Natás
ha did not answe
r.  “I think
" she’s asleep,"
" Mamma,” said "
Sónya softly. 
 After a short 
silence the coun
tess spoke again
 but this time n
o one replied. 
  Soon after th
at Natásha hear
d her mother’s
 even breathing.
 Natásha did n
"ot move, though "
her little bare 
"foot, thrust out"
 from under the 
"quilt,
was grow"
ing cold on the 
bare floor.  A
s if to celebrat
e a victory over
" everybody, a cr"
icket chirped in
 a crack in the
 wall. A cock cr
owed far off and
 another replied
 near by. The s
houting in the t
avern had died d
own; only the mo
aning of the ad
jutant was heard
. Natásha sat u
"p.

“Sónya,"
 are you asleep?
 Mamma?” she w
hispered.  No 
one replied. Nat
ásha rose slowl
"y and carefully,"
 crossed herself
", and
stepped c"
autiously on the
 cold and dirty 
floor with her s
"lim, supple,
ba"
re feet. The boa
rds of the floor
 creaked. Steppi
ng cautiously fr
om one foot to 
the other she ra
n like a kitten 
the few steps to
 the door and g
rasped the cold 
door handle.  
It seemed to her
 that something 
heavy was beatin
g rhythmically a
gainst all the 
walls of the roo
m: it was her ow
"n heart, sinking"
 with alarm and 
 terror and over
flowing with lov
e.  She opened
 the door and st
epped across the
 threshold and o
"nto the cold,
d"
amp earthen floo
r of the passage
. The cold she f
elt refreshed he
r. With her bar
e feet she touch
ed a sleeping ma
"n, stepped over "
"him, and opened"
 the door into t
he part of the h
ut where Prince 
Andrew lay. It w
as dark in ther
e. In the farthe
"st corner, on a "
bench beside a b
ed on which som
ething was lying
", stood a tallow"
 candle with a l
"ong, thick, and"
 smoldering wick
.  From the mo
ment she had bee
n told that morn
ing of Prince An
drew’s wound 
and his presence
" there, Natásha"
 had resolved to
 see him. She di
d not know why 
"she had to, she "
knew the meeting
 would be painfu
"l, but felt the"
 more convinced 
that it was nece
ssary.  All da
y she had lived 
only in hope of 
seeing him that 
night. But now 
that the moment 
had come she was
 filled with dre
ad of what she m
ight see. How w
as he maimed? Wh
at was left of h
im? Was he like 
that incessant 
moaning of the a
djutant’s? Yes
", he was altoget"
her like that. I
n her imaginati
on he was that t
errible moaning 
personified. Whe
n she saw an in
distinct shape i
"n the corner, an"
d mistook his kn
ees raised under
 the quilt for 
"his shoulders, s"
he imagined a ho
rrible body ther
"e, and stood
st"
ill in terror. B
ut an irresistib
le impulse drew 
her forward. She
 cautiously too
k one step and t
"hen another, and"
 found herself i
n the middle of
 a small room co
ntaining baggage
. Another man—
Timókhin—was 
 lying in a corn
er on the benche
s beneath the ic
"ons, and two oth"
ers—the docto
r and a valet—
lay on the floor
.  The valet s
at up and whispe
red something. T
"imókhin, kept a"
wake by the pai
n in his wounded
" leg, gazed with"
 wide-open eyes 
at this strange 
 apparition of a
 girl in a white
" chemise, dressi"
"ng jacket, and n"
ightcap. The va
"let’s sleepy, "
frightened excla
"mation, “What "
do you want? Wha
t’s the matte
r?” made Natá
sha approach mor
e swiftly to wha
t was lying in t
he corner. Horr
ibly unlike a ma
n as that body l
"ooked, she must "
see him. She pa
"ssed the valet, "
the snuff fell f
rom the candle w
"ick, and she saw"
 Prince Andrew 
clearly with his
 arms outside th
"e quilt, and suc"
h as she had al
ways seen him. 
 He was the sam
"e as ever, but t"
he feverish colo
"r of his face, h"
is glittering e
yes rapturously 
turned toward he
"r, and especiall"
"y his neck,
del"
icate as a child
"’s, revealed b"
y the turn-down 
collar of his sh
"irt,
gave him a"
 peculiarly inno
"cent, childlike "
"look, such as sh"
e had never see
n on him before.
 She went up to 
him and with a s
"wift, flexible,"
 youthful moveme
nt dropped on he
r knees.  He s
miled and held o
ut his hand to h
er.      C
HAPTER XXXII  
Seven days had p
assed since Prin
ce Andrew found 
himself in the 
ambulance statio
n on the field o
f Borodinó. His
 feverish state 
and the inflamm
ation of his bow
"els, which were "
"injured, were in"
 the doctor’s 
 opinion sure to
 carry him off. 
But on the seven
th day he ate wi
th pleasure a p
iece of bread wi
"th some tea, and"
 the doctor noti
ced that his te
mperature was lo
wer. He had rega
ined consciousne
ss that morning.
 The first nigh
t after they lef
t Moscow had bee
n fairly warm an
d he had remain
ed in the calèc
"he, but at Mytí"
shchi the wounde
d man himself as
ked to be taken
 out and given s
ome tea. The pai
n caused by his 
removal into th
e hut had made h
im groan aloud a
nd again lose co
nsciousness. Whe
n he had been p
laced on his cam
p bed he lay for
 a long time mot
ionless with cl
osed eyes. Then 
he opened them a
nd whispered sof
tly: “And the 
tea?” His rem
embering such a 
small detail of 
everyday life as
tonished the do
ctor. He felt Pr
ince Andrew’s 
"pulse, and to hi"
s surprise and 
dissatisfaction 
found it had imp
roved. He was di
ssatisfied becau
se he knew by e
xperience that i
f his patient di
"d not die now, h"
e would do so a
 little later wi
th greater suffe
"ring. Timókhin,"
 the red-nosed m
ajor of Prince 
Andrew’s regim
"ent, had joined "
him in Moscow an
d was being tak
en along with hi
"m, having been w"
ounded in the le
g at the battle 
of Borodinó. T
hey were accompa
nied by a doctor
", Prince Andrew�"
"��s valet, his
"
"coachman, and tw"
o orderlies.  
They gave Prince
 Andrew some tea
. He drank it ea
"gerly, looking w"
ith feverish ey
es at the door i
n front of him a
s if trying to u
nderstand and r
emember somethin
g.  “I don�
�t want any more
. Is Timókhin h
ere?” he asked
.  Timókhin c
rept along the b
ench to him.  
"“I am here, yo"
ur excellency.�
�  “How’s 
your wound?” 
"
“Mine, sir? "
All right. But h
ow about you?”
  Prince Andre
w again pondered
 as if trying to
 remember someth
ing.  “Could
n’t one get a 
book?” he aske
d.  “What bo
ok?”  “The
 Gospels. I have
n’t one.”  
 The doctor prom
ised to procure 
it for him and b
egan to ask how 
he was feeling.
 Prince Andrew a
nswered all his 
questions reluct
antly but reaso
"nably, and then "
said he wanted a
 bolster placed 
under him as he 
was uncomfortab
le and in great 
pain. The doctor
 and valet lifte
d the cloak wit
h which he was c
"overed and, maki"
ng wry faces at 
the noisome smel
l of mortifying
 flesh that came
" from the wound,"
 began examining
 that dreadful 
place. The docto
r was very much 
displeased about
 something and m
ade a change in
" the dressings, "
turning the woun
ded man over so 
that he groaned 
 again and grew 
unconscious and 
delirious from t
he agony. He kep
t asking them t
o get him the bo
ok and put it un
der him.  “W
hat trouble woul
d it be to you?�
�� he said. “I
 have not got on
e. Please get i
t for me and put
 it under for a 
"moment,” he pl"
eaded in a piteo
us voice.  Th
e doctor went in
to the passage t
o wash his hands
.  “You fell
ows have no cons
"cience,” said "
he to the valet 
who was pouring 
 water over his 
hands. “For ju
st one moment I 
didn’t look af
ter you... It�
"�s such pain, yo"
"u know, that I w"
onder how he can
 bear it.”  
“By the Lord J
"esus Christ, I t"
hought we had pu
t something unde
r him!” said 
the valet.  Th
e first time Pri
nce Andrew under
stood where he w
as and what was 
the matter with
 him and remembe
red being wounde
d and how was wh
en he asked to 
be carried into 
the hut after hi
s calèche had s
topped at Mytís
hchi. After gro
wing confused fr
om pain while be
ing carried into
 the hut he aga
in regained cons
"ciousness, and w"
hile drinking te
a once more reca
lled all that h
ad happened to h
"im, and above al"
l vividly rememb
ered the moment
 at the ambulanc
"e station when, "
at the sight of 
the sufferings o
f a man he disl
"iked, those new "
thoughts had com
e to him which p
romised him hap
piness. And thos
"e thoughts, thou"
gh now vague and
" indefinite, aga"
in possessed hi
s soul. He remem
bered that he ha
d now a new sour
ce of happiness
 and that this h
appiness had som
ething to do wit
h the Gospels. 
That was why he 
asked for a copy
 of them. The un
comfortable posi
tion in which t
hey had put him 
and turned him o
ver again confus
"ed his thoughts,"
 and when he ca
me to himself a 
third time it wa
s in the complet
e stillness of 
the night. Every
body near him wa
s sleeping. A cr
icket chirped f
rom across the p
assage; someone 
was shouting and
 singing in the
 street; cockroa
ches rustled on 
"the table, on th"
"e icons, and on"
"
the walls, and "
a big fly floppe
d at the head of
 the bed and aro
und the candle 
"beside him, the "
wick of which wa
s charred and ha
d shaped itself 
 like a mushroom
.  His mind wa
s not in a norma
l state. A healt
hy man usually t
"hinks of,
feels"
", and remembers "
innumerable thin
gs simultaneousl
"y, but has the
"
power and will t
o select one seq
uence of thought
s or events on w
hich to fix his
 whole attention
. A healthy man 
can tear himself
 away from the 
deepest reflecti
ons to say a civ
il word to someo
ne who comes in 
and can then re
turn again to hi
s own thoughts. 
But Prince Andre
w’s mind was n
ot in a normal 
state in that re
spect. All the p
owers of his min
d were more act
ive and clearer 
"than ever, but t"
hey acted apart 
from his will. M
ost diverse tho
ughts and images
 occupied him si
multaneously. At
 times his brai
n suddenly began
 to work with a 
"vigor, clearness"
", and depth it h"
ad never reache
d when he was in
" health, but sud"
denly in the mid
st of its work 
it would turn to
 some unexpected
 idea and he had
 not the strengt
h to turn it ba
ck again.  “
"Yes, a new happi"
ness was reveale
d to me of which
 man cannot be 
"deprived,” he "
thought as he la
y in the semidar
kness of the qui
"et hut,
gazing "
fixedly before h
im with feverish
 wide open eyes.
 “A happiness 
 lying beyond ma
"terial forces, o"
utside the mater
ial influences t
hat act on man�
��a happiness of
" the soul alone,"
 the happiness o
f loving. Every 
man can underst
"and it, but to c"
onceive it and e
njoin it was pos
sible only for 
God. But how did
 God enjoin that
 law? And why wa
s the Son...?”
  And suddenly
 the sequence of
 these thoughts 
"broke off, and P"
rince Andrew he
ard (without kno
wing whether it 
was a delusion o
r reality) a so
ft whispering vo
ice incessantly 
and rhythmically
 repeating “p
"iti-piti-piti,�"
� and then “ti
"ti,” and then "
again “piti-pi
"ti-piti,” and"
 “ti-ti” onc
e more. At the s
ame time he felt
 that above his 
"face, above
the"
 very middle of 
"it, some strange"
 airy structure 
was being erecte
d out of slende
r needles or spl
"inters, to the s"
ound of this whi
spered music. H
e felt that he h
ad to balance ca
refully (though 
it was difficult
) so that this 
airy structure s
hould not collap
se; but neverthe
less it kept co
llapsing and aga
in slowly rising
 to the sound of
 whispered rhyth
mic music—“
"it stretches, st"
"retches, spreadi"
ng out and stret
"ching,” said
"
Prince Andrew to
 himself. While 
listening to thi
s whispering and
 feeling the se
nsation of this 
drawing out and 
the construction
 of this edifice
"
of needles, he"
 also saw by gli
mpses a red halo
 round the candl
"e, and
heard th"
e rustle of the 
cockroaches and 
the buzzing of t
he fly that flo
pped against his
 pillow and his 
face. Each time 
the fly touched 
his face it gav
e him a burning 
sensation and ye
t to his surpris
e it did not de
stroy the struct
"ure, though it k"
nocked against t
he very region o
f his face wher
e it was rising.
 But besides thi
s there was some
thing else of i
mportance. It wa
s something whit
e by the door—
the statue of a 
"sphinx,
which a"
lso oppressed hi
m.  “But per
haps that’s my
 shirt on the ta
"ble,” he thoug"
"ht, “and that�"
"��s my
legs, an"
d that is the do
"or, but why is i"
t always stretch
ing and drawing 
"
itself out, and"
 ‘piti-piti-pi
ti’ and ‘ti-
ti’ and ‘pit
i-piti-piti’..
.? That’s eno
"ugh, please leav"
e off!” Prince
 Andrew painfull
y entreated som
eone. And sudden
ly thoughts and 
feelings again s
wam to the surfa
ce of his mind 
with peculiar cl
earness and forc
e.  “Yes—l
"ove,” he thoug"
ht again quite c
learly. “But n
ot love which lo
ves for somethi
"ng, for some qua"
"lity, for some p"
"urpose, or for s"
"ome reason,
but"
 the love which 
I—while dying�
��first experien
ced when I saw m
y enemy and yet
 loved him. I ex
perienced that f
eeling of love w
hich is the very
 essence of the
 soul and does n
ot require an ob
ject. Now again 
I feel that bli
ss. To love one�
"��s neighbors, t"
o love one’s e
"nemies, to love"
"
everything, to "
love God in all 
His manifestatio
ns. It is possib
le to love some
one dear to you 
"with human love,"
 but an enemy ca
n only be loved 
 by divine love.
 That is why I e
xperienced such 
joy when I felt 
that I loved th
at man. What has
 become of him? 
Is he alive?... 
  “When lovin
g with human lov
e one may pass f
rom love to hatr
"ed, but
divine "
love cannot chan
"ge. No, neither "
death nor anythi
ng else can des
troy it. It is t
he very essence 
of the soul. Yet
 how many people
 have I hated i
n my life? And o
"f them all, I lo"
ved and hated no
ne as I did her
.” And he vivi
dly pictured to 
himself Natásha
", not as he had "
done in the pas
t with nothing b
ut her charms wh
ich gave him del
"ight, but for
t"
he first time pi
cturing to himse
lf her soul. And
 he understood h
"er
feelings, he"
"r sufferings, sh"
"ame, and remorse"
. He now underst
ood for the fir
st time all the 
cruelty of his r
"ejection of her,"
 the cruelty of 
his rupture wit
h her. “If onl
y it were possib
le for me to see
 her once more! 
"
Just once, look"
ing into those e
yes to say...”
  “Piti-piti
-piti and ti-ti 
and piti-piti-pi
ti boom!” flop
ped the fly.... 
 And his attenti
on was suddenly 
carried into ano
"ther world, a wo"
rld of reality 
and delirium in 
which something 
particular was h
appening. In th
at world some st
ructure was stil
l being erected 
and did not fall
",
something was"
 still stretchin
"g out, and the c"
andle with its r
ed halo was sti
"ll burning, and "
the same shirtli
ke sphinx lay ne
ar the door; but
 besides all th
is something cre
"aked, there was "
a whiff of fresh
" air, and
a new"
 white sphinx ap
"peared, standing"
 at the door. An
d that sphinx ha
d the pale face
 and shining eye
s of the very Na
tásha of whom h
e had just been
 thinking.  �
"�Oh, how oppress"
ive this continu
"al delirium is,�"
�� thought Princ
"e Andrew,
tryin"
g to drive that 
face from his im
agination. But t
he face remained
 before him wit
h the force of r
eality and drew 
nearer. Prince A
ndrew wished to
 return to that 
former world of 
"pure thought, bu"
"t he could not,"
 and delirium dr
ew him back into
 its domain. The
 soft whispering
 voice continue
d its rhythmic m
"urmur, something"
 oppressed him a
nd stretched ou
"t, and the stran"
ge face was befo
re him. Prince A
ndrew collected 
all his strengt
h in an effort t
o recover his se
"nses, he moved a"
" little, and
su"
ddenly there was
 a ringing in hi
"s ears, a dimnes"
"s in his eyes, a"
nd like a man p
lunged into wate
r he lost consci
ousness. When he
 came to himsel
"f, Natásha, tha"
t same living Na
tásha whom of a
ll people he mos
t longed to lov
e with this new 
pure divine love
 that had been r
"evealed to
him,"
 was kneeling be
fore him. He rea
lized that it wa
s the real livin
"g
Natásha, and"
 he was not surp
rised but quietl
y happy. Natásh
"a, motionless
o"
n her knees (she
 was unable to s
"tir), with frigh"
tened eyes rivet
"ed on
him, was "
restraining her 
sobs. Her face w
as pale and rigi
d. Only in the 
lower part of it
 something quive
red.  Prince A
ndrew sighed wit
"h relief, smiled"
", and held out h"
is hand.  “Y
ou?” he said. 
“How fortunate
!”  With a r
apid but careful
 movement Natás
ha drew nearer t

 “Forgive...!

ked.  “Forgi

 faltered Natás

�� said Prince A
"ndrew, lifting h"
er face with hi

look into her ey
es.  Those eye
"s, filled with h"
"appy tears, gaze"
d at him timidly
",

ha’s thin pale

its"
" swollen lips, w"
as more than pla
in—it was drea
dful. But Prince
 Andrew did not
" see that, he sa"
w her shining ey
es which were be
autiful. They h
eard the sound o
f voices behind 
them.  Peter t
"he valet, who wa"

 CHAPTER XXXIII
  On the third
 of September Pi
erre awoke late.
 His head was ac
"hing, the
cloth"
es in which he h
ad slept without
 undressing felt
 uncomfortable o
"n
his body, and"
 his mind had a 
dim consciousnes
s of something s
hameful he had 
done the day bef
ore. That someth
ing shameful was
 his yesterday�
�s conversation
 with Captain Ra
mballe.  It wa
s eleven by the 
"clock, but it se"
emed peculiarly 
dark out of door
"s.
Pierre rose,"
 rubbed his eyes
", and seeing the"
 pistol with an 
engraved stock 
which Gerásim h
ad replaced on t
he writing table
", he remembered"
 where he was an
d what lay befor
e him that very 
day.  “Am I 
not too late?”
 he thought. “
"No, probably he "
won’t make his
 entry into Mos
cow before noon.
”  Pierre di
d not allow hims
elf to reflect o
n what lay befor
"e him, but
hast"
ened to act.  
After arranging 
"his clothes, he "
took the pistol 
and was about to
 go out. But it
 then occurred t
o him for the fi
rst time that he
 certainly could
 not carry the 
weapon in his ha
nd through the s
treets. It was d
ifficult to hid
e such a big pis
tol even under h
is wide coat. He
 could not carr
y it unnoticed i
n his belt or un
der his arm. Bes
"ides, it had bee"
"n
discharged, a"
nd he had not ha
d time to reload
 it. “No matte
"r, the dagger
w"
"ill do,” he sa"
"id to himself, t"
hough when plann
ing his design h
e had more than
 once come to th
e conclusion tha
t the chief mist
ake made by the 
 student in 1809
 had been to try
 to kill Napoleo
n with a dagger.
 But as his chi
ef aim consisted
 not in carrying
" out his design,"
 but in proving 
 to himself that
 he would not ab
andon his intent
ion and was doin
g all he could 
"to achieve it, P"
ierre hastily to
ok the blunt jag
ged dagger in a 
 green sheath wh
ich he had bough
t at the Súkhar
ev market with t
"he pistol,
and "
hid it under his
 waistcoat.  H
aving tied a gir
dle over his coa
t and pulled his
 cap low on his 
"head,
Pierre we"
nt down the corr
"idor, trying to "
avoid making a n
oise or meeting 
"
the captain, an"
d passed out int
o the street.  
 The conflagrati
"on, at which he "
had looked with 
so much indiffer
ence the evenin
"g before, had gr"
eatly increased 
during the night
. Moscow was on 
 fire in several
 places. The bui
ldings in Carria
"ge Row, across t"
"he river,
in th"
e Bazaar and the
" Povarskóy, as "
well as the barg
es on the Moskv�
� River and the
 timber yards by
 the Dorogomílo
"v Bridge, were a"
ll ablaze.  Pi
erre’s way led
 through side st
reets to the Pov
arskóy and from
 there to the c
hurch of St. Nic
holas on the Arb
"át, where he ha"
d long before d
ecided that the 
deed should be d
one. The gates o
f most of the ho
uses were locke
d and the shutte
rs up. The stree
ts and lanes wer
e deserted. The
 air was full of
 smoke and the s
mell of burning.
 Now and then he
 met Russians w
ith anxious and 
"timid faces, and"
 Frenchmen with 
an air not of t
he city but of t
"he camp, walking"
 in the middle o
f the streets. B
oth the Russian
s and the French
 looked at Pierr
e with surprise.
 Besides his he
ight and stoutne
"ss, and the stra"
nge morose look 
of suffering in 
his face and wh
"ole figure, the "
Russians stared 
at Pierre becaus
e they could no
t make out to wh
at class he coul
d belong. The Fr
ench followed hi
m with astonish
ment in their ey
es chiefly becau
"se Pierre, unlik"
e all the other
 Russians who ga
zed at the Frenc
h with fear and 
"curiosity, paid "
no attention to
 them. At the ga
te of one house 
"three Frenchmen,"
 who were expla
ining something 
to some Russians
 who did not und
"erstand them,
s"
topped Pierre as
king if he did n
ot know French. 
  Pierre shook 
his head and wen
t on. In another
 side street a s
entinel standin
g beside a green
 caisson shouted
" at him, but onl"
y when the shout
 was threatenin
gly repeated and
 he heard the cl
ick of the man�
�s musket as he
 raised it did P
ierre understand
 that he had to 
pass on the othe
r side of the s
treet. He heard 
nothing and saw 
nothing of what 
went on around 
him. He carried 
his resolution w
ithin himself in
 terror and hast
"e, like
somethi"
ng dreadful and 
"alien to him, fo"
"r, after the pre"
vious night’s 
"
experience, he "
was afraid of lo
sing it. But he 
was not destined
 to bring his m
ood safely to hi
s destination. A
nd even had he n
ot been hindered
 by anything on
" the way, his in"
tention could no
t now have been 
"carried out,
fo"
r Napoleon had p
assed the Arbát
 more than four 
hours previously
 on his way fro
m the Dorogomíl
ov suburb to the
" Krémlin, and w"
as now sitting i
n a very gloomy
 frame of mind i
n a royal study 
"in the Krémlin,"
 giving detaile
d and exact orde
rs as to measure
s to be taken im
mediately to ex
tinguish the fir
"e, to prevent lo"
"oting, and to re"
assure the inha
bitants. But Pie
rre did not know
 this; he was en
tirely absorbed 
 in what lay bef
"ore him, and was"
 tortured—as t
hose are who obs
tinately undert
ake a task that 
is impossible fo
r them not becau
se of its diffi
culty but becaus
e of its incompa
tibility with th
eir natures—by
 the fear of we
akening at the d
ecisive moment a
nd so losing his
 self-esteem.  
 Though he heard
 and saw nothing
 around him he f
ound his way by 
instinct and di
d not go wrong i
n the side stree
ts that led to t
he Povarskóy. 
 As Pierre appr
oached that stre
et the smoke bec
ame denser and d
enser—he even
 felt the heat o
f the fire. Occa
sionally curly t
ongues of flame 
rose from under
 the roofs of th
e houses. He met
 more people in 
the streets and
 they were more 
excited. But Pie
"rre, though he f"
elt that somethi
ng unusual was 
happening around
" him, did not re"
alize that he wa
s approaching t
he fire. As he w
as going along a
 footpath across
 a wide-open sp
ace adjoining th
e Povarskóy on 
one side and the
 gardens of Pri
nce Gruzínski�
�s house on the 
"other, Pierre su"
ddenly heard the
 desperate weep
ing of a woman c
lose to him. He 
stopped as if aw
akening from a 
dream and lifted
 his head.  By
 the side of the
" path, on the du"
"sty dry grass, a"
ll sorts of hous
ehold goods lay
 in a heap: feat
"herbeds, a samov"
"ar, icons, and t"
runks. On the g
"round, beside th"
"e trunks, sat a "
thin woman no lo
"nger young, with"
" long,
prominen"
"t upper teeth, a"
nd wearing a bla
ck cloak and cap
". This woman,
s"
waying to and fr
o and muttering 
"something, was c"
hoking with sobs
. Two girls of 
about ten and tw
"elve, dressed in"
 dirty short fro
"cks and cloaks,"
 were staring at
 their mother wi
th a look of stu
pefaction on the
ir pale frighte
ned faces. The y
"oungest child, a"
 boy of about se
"ven, who wore an"
 overcoat and a
n immense cap ev
idently not his 
"own, was crying "
in his old nurs
e’s arms. A di
"rty, barefooted "
maid was sitting
" on a trunk,
an"
"d, having undone"
 her pale-colore
"d plait, was pul"
ling it straight
 and sniffing a
t her singed hai
r. The woman’s
" husband, a shor"
"t,
round-should"
ered man in the 
undress uniform 
of a civilian of
"ficial, with
sa"
usage-shaped whi
skers and showin
g under his squa
re-set cap the h
air smoothly br
ushed forward ov
"er his temples, "
with expressionl
ess face was mo
"ving the trunks,"
 which were plac
ed one on anothe
"r, and was dragg"
ing some garmen
ts from under th
em.  As soon a
s she saw Pierre
", the woman almo"
st threw herself
 at his feet.  
"
“Dear people,"
 good Christians
", save me, help "
"me, dear friends"
"... help
us, so"
"mebody,” she m"
uttered between 
her sobs. “My 
girl... My daugh
ter! My younges
t daughter is le
ft behind. She�
�s burned! Ooh! 
Was it for this 
 I nursed you...
. Ooh!”  “
"Don’t, Mary Ni"
koláevna!” sa
id her husband t
o her in a low v
"oice,
evidently"
 only to justify
 himself before 
the stranger. �
�Sister must hav
"e
taken her, or"
 else where can 
she be?” he ad
ded.  “Monst
er! Villain!” 
shouted the woma
"n angrily, sudde"
nly ceasing to w
eep. “You hav
"e no heart, you "
don’t feel for
 your own child!
 Another man wou
ld have rescued
 her from the fi
re. But this is 
a monster and ne
ither a man nor
" a father! You, "
"honored sir, are"
" a noble man,”"
" she went on,
a"
ddressing Pierre
 rapidly between
 her sobs. “Th
e fire broke out
"
alongside, and"
" blew our way, t"
he maid called o
ut ‘Fire!’ a
nd we rushed to
 collect our thi
ngs. We ran out 
just as we were.
... This is what
 we have brough
t away.... The i
"cons, and my dow"
"ry bed, all the "
rest is lost. W
e seized the chi
ldren. But not K
atie! Ooh! O Lor
d!...” and aga
in she began to
 sob. “My chil
"d, my dear one! "
"Burned, burned!�"
��  “But whe
re was she left?
” asked Pierre
.  From the ex
pression of his 
animated face th
e woman saw that
 this man might
 help her.  �
"�Oh, dear sir!�"
"� she cried, sei"
zing him by the 
legs. “My bene
"factor, set
my "
heart at ease...
". Aníska, go, y"
"ou horrid girl, "
show him the way
!” she cried 
"to the maid, ang"
rily opening her
 mouth and still
 farther exposin
g her long teet
h.  “Show me
" the way, show m"
"e, I... I’ll d"
"o it,” gasped "
Pierre rapidly. 
  The dirty mai
dservant stepped
 from behind the
" trunk, put up h"
"er plait,
sighe"
"d, and went on h"
"er short, bare f"
eet along the pa
th. Pierre felt 
 as if he had co
me back to life 
after a heavy sw
oon. He held his
" head
higher, h"
is eyes shone wi
th the light of 
"life, and with s"
wift steps he f
ollowed the maid
", overtook her, "
and came out on 
the Povarskóy. 
The whole stree
t was full of cl
ouds of black sm
oke. Tongues of 
flame here and 
there broke thro
ugh that cloud. 
A great number o
f people crowded
 in front of th
e conflagration.
 In the middle o
f the street sto
od a French gen
eral saying some
thing to those a
round him. Pierr
"e, accompanied b"
"y the
maid, was"
 advancing to th
e spot where the
" general stood, "
but the French 
soldiers stopped
 him.  “On n
e passe pas!” 
* cried a voice.
      * “You
 can’t pass!�
�   “This w
"ay, uncle,” cr"
ied the girl. �
�We’ll pass th
rough the side s
"treet,
by the N"
ikúlins’!” 
  Pierre turned
" back, giving a "
spring now and t
hen to keep up w
ith her. She ra
n across the str
"eet, turned down"
 a side street t
"o the left, and,"
 passing three 
"houses, turned i"
nto a yard on th
e right.  “I
"t’s here, clos"
"e by,” said sh"
"e and, running a"
"cross the yard, "
opened a gate i
n a wooden fence
" and, stopping, "
pointed out to h
im a small woode
n wing of the h
"ouse, which was "
burning brightly
 and fiercely. O
ne of its sides
" had fallen in, "
another was on f
"ire, and bright "
flames issued fr
om the openings
 of the windows 
and from under t
he roof.  As P
ierre passed thr
ough the fence g
"ate, he was enve"
loped by hot air
 and involuntar
ily stopped.  
“Which is it? 
Which is your ho
use?” he asked
.  “Ooh!” 
"wailed the girl,"
 pointing to the
 wing. “That�
"�s it, that was "
our lodging. Yo
u’ve burned to
" death, our trea"
"sure, Katie, my "
precious little 
 missy! Ooh!” 
lamented Aníska
", who at the sig"
ht of the fire f
elt that she to
o must give expr
ession to her fe
elings.  Pierr
e rushed to the 
"wing, but the he"
at was so great 
that he involun
tarily passed ro
und in a curve a
nd came upon the
 large house th
at was as yet bu
rning only at on
"e end, just belo"
"w the roof, and "
around which sw
armed a crowd of
 Frenchmen. At f
irst Pierre did 
not realize wha
"t these men, who"
 were dragging s
"omething out, we"
re about; but se
eing before him
 a Frenchman hit
ting a peasant w
ith a blunt sabe
r and trying to
 take from him a
" fox-fur coat, h"
e vaguely unders
tood that lootin
g was going on 
"there, but he ha"
d no time to dwe
ll on that idea.
  The sounds o
f crackling and 
the din of falli
ng walls and cei
"lings, the
whis"
tle and hiss of 
"the flames, the "
excited shouts o
"f the people, an"
d the sight of 
the swaying smok
"e, now gathering"
 into thick blac
k clouds and no
w soaring up wit
h glittering spa
"rks, with here a"
nd there dense 
sheaves of flame
 (now red and no
w like golden fi
sh scales creepi
ng along the wa
"lls), and the he"
at and smoke and
 rapidity of mot
"ion, produced
o"
n Pierre the usu
al animating eff
ects of a confla
gration. It had 
a peculiarly st
rong effect on h
im because at th
e sight of the f
ire he felt him
self suddenly fr
eed from the ide
as that had weig
hed him down. He
" felt
young, br"
"ight, adroit, an"
d resolute. He r
an round to the 
other side of t
he lodge and was
 about to dash i
nto that part of
 it which was st
"ill
standing, w"
hen just above h
is head he heard
 several voices 
shouting and th
en a cracking so
und and the ring
 of something he
avy falling clos
e beside him. 
 Pierre looked 
up and saw at a 
window of the la
rge house some F
renchmen who ha
d just thrown ou
t the drawer of 
"a chest, filled "
with metal arti
cles. Other Fren
ch soldiers stan
ding below went 
up to the drawer
.  “What doe
s this fellow wa
nt?” shouted o
ne of them refer
ring to Pierre. 
  “There’s 
a child in that 
house. Haven’t
 you seen a chil
d?” cried Pier
re.  “What�
�s he talking ab
out? Get along!�
�� said several 
"voices, and one "
of the soldiers
", evidently afra"
id that Pierre m
ight want to tak
e from them som
e of the plate a
nd bronzes that 
were in the draw
"er, moved
threa"
teningly toward 
him.  “A chi
ld?” shouted a
 Frenchman from 
above. “I did 
hear something 
squealing in the
 garden. Perhaps
 it’s his brat
 that the fellow
 is looking for
". After all, one"
" must be human, "
you know....” 
  “Where is i
t? Where?” sai
d Pierre.  “
There! There!”
 shouted the Fre
nchman at the wi
"ndow, pointing t"
o the garden at
 the back of the
 house. “Wait 
a bit—I’m co
ming down.”  
 And a minute or
 two later the F
"renchman, a blac"
k-eyed fellow wi
th a spot on hi
"s cheek, in shir"
"t sleeves, reall"
y did jump out o
f a window on th
"e
ground floor,"
 and clapping Pi
erre on the shou
lder ran with hi
m into the gard
en.  “Hurry 
"up, you others!�"
�� he called out
 to his comrades
. “It’s gett
ing hot.”  
When they reache
d a gravel path 
behind the house
 the Frenchman p
ulled Pierre by
 the arm and poi
"nted to a round,"
 graveled space 
where a three-y
ear-old girl in 
a pink dress was
 lying under a s
eat.  “There
 is your child! 
"Oh, a girl, so m"
uch the better!�
�� said the Fre
nchman. “Good-
"by, Fatty. We mu"
"st be human, we "
are all mortal y
ou know!” and
 the Frenchman w
ith the spot on 
his cheek ran ba
ck to his comra
des.  Breathle
"ss with joy, Pie"
rre ran to the l
ittle girl and w
as going to take
 her in his arm
s. But seeing a 
stranger the sic
"kly, scrofulous-"
"looking
child, "
unattractively l
"ike her mother, "
began to yell an
d run away. Pie
"rre, however, se"
ized her and lif
ted her in his a
rms. She screame
d desperately a
nd angrily and t
ried with her li
ttle hands to pu
ll Pierre’s h
ands away and to
 bite them with 
her slobbering m
outh. Pierre was
 seized by a se
nse of horror an
d repulsion such
 as he had exper
ienced when tou
ching some nasty
 little animal. 
But he made an e
ffort not to thr
ow the child do
wn and ran with 
her to the large
 house. It was n
"ow, however,
im"
possible to get 
back the way he 
had come; the ma
"id, Aníska, was"
 no longer ther
"e, and Pierre wi"
th a feeling of 
pity and disgust
 pressed the we
"t, painfully sob"
bing child to hi
mself as tenderl
y as he could an
d ran with her 
through the gard
en seeking anoth
er way out.   
    CHAPTER X
XXIV  Having r
un through diffe
rent yards and s
"ide streets, Pie"
rre got back wi
th his little bu
rden to the Gruz
ínski garden at
 the corner of t
he Povarskóy. 
He did not at fi
rst recognize th
e place from whi
ch he had set o
ut to look for t
"he child, so cro"
wded was it now 
with people and 
goods that had 
been dragged out
 of the houses. 
Besides Russian 
families who ha
d taken refuge h
ere from the fir
e with their bel
"ongings, there w"
ere several Fre
nch soldiers in 
a variety of clo
thing. Pierre to
ok no notice of
 them. He hurrie
d to find the fa
mily of that civ
il servant in or
der to restore 
the daughter to 
her mother and g
o to save someon
e else. Pierre 
felt that he had
 still much to d
o and to do quic
kly. Glowing wit
h the heat and 
"from running, he"
 felt at that mo
ment more strong
ly than ever th
e sense of youth
", animation, and"
 determination t
hat had come on 
him when he ran
 to save the chi
ld. She had now 
become quiet and
", clinging
with"
 her little hand
s to Pierre’s 
"coat, sat on his"
 arm gazing abou
t her like some
 little wild ani
mal. He glanced 
at her occasiona
lly with a slig
ht smile. He fan
cied he saw some
thing pathetical
ly innocent in t
"hat
frightened,"
 sickly little f
ace.  He did n
ot find the civi
l servant or his
 wife where he h
ad left them. He
 walked among t
he crowd with ra
"pid steps, scann"
ing the various 
faces he met. I
nvoluntarily he 
noticed a Georgi
an or Armenian f
amily consistin
g of a very hand
some old man of 
"Oriental type, w"
"earing a new,
c"
"loth-covered, sh"
eepskin coat and
" new boots, an o"
ld woman of simi
"lar
type, and a"
 young woman. Th
at very young wo
man seemed to Pi
erre the perfec
tion of Oriental
" beauty, with he"
r sharply outlin
"ed, arched,
bla"
ck eyebrows and 
the extraordinar
"ily soft, bright"
 color of her lo
"ng,
beautiful, "
expressionless f
ace. Amid the sc
attered property
 and the crowd 
on the open spac
"e, she, in her r"
ich satin cloak 
with a bright l
ilac shawl on he
"r head, suggeste"
d a delicate exo
tic plant thrown
 out onto the s
now. She was sit
ting on some bun
dles a little be
hind the old wo
"man, and looked "
from under her l
ong lashes with 
"motionless, larg"
"e,
almond-shape"
d eyes at the gr
ound before her.
 Evidently she w
as aware of her
 beauty and fear
ful because of i
t. Her face stru
"ck Pierre and,
"
hurrying along b
"y the fence, he "
turned several t
imes to look at 
her. When he ha
d reached the fe
"nce, still witho"
ut finding those
" he sought, he
"
stopped and look
ed about him.  
 With the child 
in his arms his 
figure was now m
ore conspicuous 
"than
before, an"
d a group of Rus
"sians, both men "
"and women, gathe"
red about him. 
 “Have you lo
"st anyone, my de"
ar fellow? You�
�re of the gentr
"y yourself,
are"
n’t you? Whose
 child is it?”
 they asked him.
  Pierre repli
ed that the chil
d belonged to a 
woman in a black
 coat who had b
een sitting ther
e with her other
" children, and h"
e asked whether 
 anyone knew whe
re she had gone.
"

“Why, that"
 must be the Anf
"érovs,” said "
"an old deacon, a"
ddressing a poc
kmarked peasant 
woman. “Lord h
"ave mercy, Lord "
have mercy!” h
e added in his 
customary bass. 
  “The Anfér
"ovs? No,” said"
 the woman. “T
hey left in the 
morning. That mu
st be either Ma
ry Nikoláevna�
�s or the Iváno
vs’!”  “
He says ‘a wom
"an,’ and Mary "
Nikoláevna is a
" lady,” remark"
ed a house serf
.  “Do you k
now her? She’s
" thin, with long"
" teeth,” said "
Pierre.  “Th
at’s Mary Niko
láevna! They we
nt inside the ga
rden when these 
wolves swooped 
"down,” said th"
"e woman, pointin"
g to the French 
soldiers.  “
"O Lord, have mer"
cy!” added the
 deacon.  “G
"o over that way,"
 they’re there
. It’s she! Sh
e kept on lament
"ing and
crying,"
” continued th
e woman. “It�
"�s she. Here, th"
is way!”  Bu
t Pierre was not
 listening to th
e woman. He had 
for some seconds
 been intently 
watching what wa
s going on a few
 steps away. He 
was looking at 
the Armenian fam
ily and at two F
rench soldiers w
ho had gone up t
o them. One of 
"these, a nimble "
"little man, was "
wearing a blue c
oat tied round 
the waist with a
 rope. He had a 
nightcap on his 
head and his fee
t were bare. Th
"e other, whose a"
ppearance partic
ularly struck Pi
"erre, was a
lon"
"g, lank, round-s"
"houldered, fair-"
"haired man, slow"
 in his movement
s and with an i
diotic expressio
n of face. He wo
re a woman’s l
oose gown of fr
"ieze, blue trous"
"ers, and large t"
orn Hessian boot
s. The little b
arefooted French
man in the blue 
coat went up to 
the Armenians an
"d,
saying somet"
"hing, immediatel"
y seized the old
 man by his legs
 and the old ma
n at once began 
pulling off his 
boots. The other
 in the frieze g
own stopped in 
front of the bea
utiful Armenian 
girl and with hi
s hands in his 
pockets stood st
"aring at her, mo"
tionless and sil
"ent.

“Here,"
 take the child!
” said Pierre 
peremptorily and
 hurriedly to th
"e
woman, handin"
g the little gir
l to her. “Giv
e her back to th
"em, give her
ba"
ck!” he almost
" shouted, puttin"
"g the child, who"
 began screaming
", on the
ground"
", and again look"
ing at the Frenc
hman and the Arm
enian family.  
 The old man was
 already sitting
 barefoot. The l
ittle Frenchman 
had secured his
 second boot and
 was slapping on
e boot against t
he other. The o
ld man was sayin
g something in a
 voice broken by
" sobs, but Pierr"
e caught but a 
"glimpse of this,"
 his whole atten
tion was directe
d to the French
man in the friez
e gown who meanw
"hile, swaying sl"
owly from side t
"o
side, had dra"
wn nearer to the
 young woman and
 taking his hand
s from his pock
ets had seized h
er by the neck. 
  The beautiful
 Armenian still 
sat motionless a
nd in the same a
"ttitude,
with h"
er long lashes d
rooping as if sh
e did not see or
 feel what the 
soldier was doin
g to her.  Whi
le Pierre was ru
nning the few st
eps that separat
ed him from the 
"
Frenchman, the "
tall marauder in
 the frieze gown
 was already tea
ring from her n
eck the necklace
 the young Armen
"ian was wearing,"
 and the young 
"woman, clutching"
" at her neck, sc"
reamed piercingl
y.  “Let tha
t woman alone!�
� exclaimed Pier
re hoarsely in a
" furious voice,"
 seizing the sol
dier by his roun
d shoulders and 
throwing him asi
de.  The soldi
"er fell, got up,"
 and ran away. B
"ut his comrade, "
throwing down t
he boots and dra
"wing his sword, "
moved threatenin
gly toward Pierr
"e.

“Voyons,"
 pas de bêtises
!” * he cried.
      * “Loo
"k here, no nonse"
nse!”   Pie
rre was in such 
a transport of r
age that he reme
mbered nothing a
nd his strength
 increased tenfo
ld. He rushed at
 the barefooted 
"Frenchman
and, "
before the latte
r had time to dr
"aw his sword, kn"
ocked him off hi
s feet and hamm
ered him with hi
s fists. Shouts 
of approval were
 heard from the
" crowd around, a"
nd at the same m
oment a mounted 
patrol of French
 Uhlans appeare
d from round the
 corner. The Uhl
ans came up at a
 trot to Pierre
 and the Frenchm
an and surrounde
d them. Pierre r
emembered nothin
g of what happe
ned after that. 
He only remember
ed beating someo
ne and being be
aten and finally
 feeling that hi
s hands were bou
nd and that a c
rowd of French s
oldiers stood ar
ound him and wer
e searching him.
  “Lieutenan
"t, he has a dagg"
"er,” were the "
first words Pier
re understood. 
"
“Ah, a weapo"
n?” said the o
fficer and turne
d to the barefoo
ted soldier who
 had been arrest
ed with Pierre. 
"“All right, yo"
u can tell all a
bout it at the 
court-martial.�
� Then he turned
 to Pierre. “D
o you speak Fren
ch?”  Pierre
 looked around h
im with bloodsho
t eyes and did n
ot reply. His f
ace probably loo
ked very terribl
"e, for the offic"
er said somethin
g in a whisper 
and four more Uh
lans left the ra
nks and placed t
hemselves on bo
th sides of Pier
re.  “Do you
 speak French?�
� the officer as
"ked again, keepi"
ng at a distance
 from Pierre. �
��Call the inter
preter.”  A 
little man in Ru
ssian civilian c
lothes rode out 
"from the ranks, "
and by his clot
hes and manner o
f speaking Pierr
e at once knew h
im to be a Fren
ch salesman from
 one of the Mosc
ow shops.  “
He does not look
 like a common m
"an,” said the "
"interpreter, aft"
er a searching 
look at Pierre. 
"

“Ah, he loo"
ks very much lik
"e an incendiary,"
” remarked the
 officer. “And
 ask him who he
" is,” he added"
.  “Who are 
you?” asked th
e interpreter in
 poor Russian. �
��You must answe
r the chief.”
  “I will no
t tell you who I
 am. I am your p
risoner—take m
e!” Pierre su
ddenly replied i
n French.  “
"Ah, ah!” mutte"
red the officer 
with a frown. �
"�Well then, marc"
h!”  A crowd
 had collected r
ound the Uhlans.
 Nearest to Pier
re stood the po
ckmarked peasant
 woman with the 
"little girl, and"
 when the patrol
 started she mo
ved forward.  
“Where are the
"y taking you to,"
 you poor dear?�
�� said she. “
And the little 
"girl, the little"
" girl, what am I"
 to do with her 
if she’s not t
heirs?” said 
the woman.  �
�What does that 
woman want?” a
sked the officer
.  Pierre was 
as if intoxicate
d. His elation i
ncreased at the 
sight of the li
ttle girl he had
 saved.  “Wh
at does she want
?” he murmured
. “She is brin
ging me my daugh
ter whom I have
 just saved from
" the flames,” "
said he. “Good
-by!” And with
out knowing how
 this aimless li
e had escaped hi
"m, he went along"
 with resolute 
and triumphant s
teps between the
 French soldiers
.  The French 
patrol was one o
f those sent out
 through the var
ious streets of
 Moscow by Duros
nel’s order to
 put a stop to t
"he pillage,

 especially to c

the patrol arres
ted five more Ru

a small shopkee
"per, two seminar"
"y students, a pe"
"asant, and a hou"
"se serf, besides"
 several looter
s. But of all th
ese various susp

was co"
nsidered to be t

us of all. When 
they had all bee

K TWELVE: 1812 
     CHAPTE
R I  In Peters
burg at that tim
e a complicated 
struggle was bei
ng carried on w
ith greater heat
 than ever in th
e highest circle
"s, between the p"
arties of Rumy�
"�ntsev, the Fren"
"ch, Márya Fëdo"
"rovna, the Tsar�"
"�vich, and other"
"s,
drowned as u"
sual by the buzz
ing of the court
 drones. But the
" calm,
luxuriou"
s life of Peters
"burg, concerned "
only about phant
oms and reflect
ions of real lif
"e, went on in it"
s old way and ma
"de it hard,
exc"
ept by a great e
"ffort, to realiz"
e the danger and
 the difficult 
position of the 
Russian people. 
There were the s
ame receptions a
"nd
balls, the s"
ame French theat
"er, the same cou"
rt interests and
 service intere
sts and intrigue
s as usual. Only
 in the very hig
hest circles wer
e attempts made
 to keep in mind
 the difficultie
s of the actual 
position. Stori
es were whispere
d of how differe
ntly the two Emp
resses behaved 
in these difficu
lt circumstances
. The Empress M�
"�rya, concerned "
for the welfare
 of the charitab
le and education
al institutions 
under her patro
"nage, had given "
directions that 
they should all 
be removed to K
"azán, and the t"
hings belonging 
to these institu
tions had alread
y been packed u
p. The Empress E
"lisabeth, howeve"
"r, when asked wh"
at instructions 
 she would be pl
eased to give—
with her charact
eristic Russian 
patriotism had 
replied that she
 could give no d
irections about 
state institutio
ns for that was
 the affair of t
"he sovereign, bu"
t as far as she 
personally was 
concerned she wo
uld be the last 
to quit Petersbu
rg.  At Anna P
ávlovna’s on 
the twenty-sixth
" of August, the "
very day of the 
 battle of Borod
"inó, there was "
"a soiree, the ch"
ief feature of w
hich was to be 
the reading of a
 letter from His
 Lordship the Bi
shop when sendin
g the Emperor a
n icon of the Ve
nerable Sergius.
 It was regarded
 as a model of 
"ecclesiastical, "
patriotic eloque
nce. Prince Vas�
"�li himself, fam"
ed for his eloc
"ution, was to re"
ad it. (He used 
to read at the E
mpress’.) The 
 art of his read
ing was supposed
 to lie in rolli
ng out the words
", quite
indepen"
dently of their 
"meaning, in a lo"
ud and singsong 
voice alternatin
g between a des
pairing wail and
 a tender murmur
", so that the wa"
il fell quite a
t random on one 
word and the mur
mur on another. 
"This reading,
a"
s was always the
 case at Anna P�
�vlovna’s soir
"ees, had a polit"
ical significan
ce. That evening
 she expected se
veral important 
personages who 
had to be made a
shamed of their 
visits to the Fr
ench theater and
 aroused to a p
atriotic temper.
 A good many peo
ple had already 
"arrived, but Ann"
"a
Pávlovna, no"
t yet seeing all
 those whom she 
wanted in her dr
"awing room,
did"
 not let the rea
ding begin but w
ound up the spri
ngs of a general
 conversation. 
  The news of t
he day in Peters
burg was the ill
ness of Countess
 Bezúkhova. Sh
e had fallen ill
 unexpectedly a 
few days previou
"sly, had missed"
 several gatheri
ngs of which she
 was usually the
" ornament, and w"
as said to be r
"eceiving no one,"
 and instead of 
the celebrated P
etersburg doctor
s who usually a
ttended her had 
entrusted hersel
f to some Italia
n doctor who wa
s treating her i
n some new and u
nusual way.  T
hey all knew ver
y well that the 
enchanting count
ess’ illness a
rose from an in
convenience resu
lting from marry
ing two husbands
 at the same tim
"e,
and that the"
 Italian’s cur
e consisted in r
emoving such inc
onvenience; but
 in Anna Pávlov
na’s presence 
no one dared to 
think of this or
 even appear to
 know it.  “
They say the poo
r countess is ve
ry ill. The doct
or says it is an
gina pectoris.�
��  “Angina?
" Oh, that’s a "
terrible illness
!”  “They 
say that the riv
als are reconcil
"ed, thanks to th"
e angina...” a
nd the word ang
ina was repeated
 with great sati
sfaction.  “
The count is pat
"hetic, they say."
 He cried like a
 child when the 
doctor told him
 the case was da
ngerous.”  �
"��Oh, it would b"
e a terrible los
"s, she is an enc"
hanting woman.�
�  “You are 
speaking of the 
poor countess?�
� said Anna Páv
"lovna, coming
u"
p just then. “
I sent to ask fo
"r news, and hear"
 that she is a l
ittle better. O
"h, she is certai"
nly the most cha
rming woman in t
"he world,” she"
"
went on, with "
a smile at her o

Anna Pávlovna. 
  Supposing tha

 Anna Pávlovna 
was somewhat lif

entured to expre

Your information

a Pávlovna sudd

�but I know on g

He is private p

Queen of Spain.�
��  And having
 thus demolished
" the young man, "
Anna Pávlovna t
urned to anothe

trians: having 
wrinkled up his 
face he was evid
ently preparing 
to smooth it out
 again and utte

from the French

he was then call

hat’s that?”
 asked Anna Páv
"lovna, securing "
silence for the 
"mot,
which she "
had heard before
.  And Bilíbi

ctual words of t

“Charming, ch"

 CHAPTER II  
Anna Pávlovna�
�s presentiment 
was in fact fulf
illed. Next day 
during the serv
ice at the palac
e church in hono
r of the Emperor
"’s birthday, P"
rince Volkónsk
i was called out
 of the church a
nd received a di
spatch from Pri
nce Kutúzov. It
 was Kutúzov’
"s report, writte"
n from Tatárino
va on the day o
f the battle. Ku
túzov wrote tha
t the Russians h
ad not retreated
" a
step, that t"
he French losses
 were much heavi
"er than ours, an"
d that he was w
riting in haste 
from the field o
f battle before 
collecting full 
 information. It
 followed that t
here must have b
een a victory. A
"nd at
once, wit"
hout leaving the
" church, thanks "
were rendered to
 the Creator fo
r His help and f
or the victory. 
  Anna Pávlovn
a’s presentime
nt was justified
", and all that m"
orning a joyous
ly festive mood 
reigned in the c
ity. Everyone be
lieved the victo
ry to have been
" complete, and s"
ome even spoke o
f Napoleon’s h
aving been capt
"ured, of his dep"
"osition, and of "
the choice of a 
new ruler for F
rance.  It is 
very difficult f
or events to be 
reflected in the
ir real strength
 and completene
ss amid the cond
itions of court 
life and far fro
m the scene of 
action. General 
events involunta
rily group thems
elves around so
me particular in
cident. So now t
he courtiers’ 
pleasure was bas
ed as much on t
he fact that the
 news had arrive
d on the Emperor
’s birthday as
 on the fact of
 the victory its
elf. It was like
 a successfully 
arranged surpri
se. Mention was 
made in Kutúzov
’s report of t
he Russian losse
"s,
among which "
figured the name
"s of Túchkov, B"
"agratión, and K"
utáysov. In th
e Petersburg wor
ld this sad side
 of the affair a
gain involuntari
ly centered rou
nd a single inci
dent: Kutáysov�
��s death. Every
"body knew
him, "
the Emperor like
"d him, and he wa"
s young and inte
resting. That da
y everyone met 
with the words: 
  “What a won
derful coinciden
ce! Just during 
the service. But
 what a loss Ku
táysov is! How 
sorry I am!” 
 “What did I 
tell about Kutú
zov?” Prince V
asíli now said 
with a prophet�
��s pride. “I 
always said he w
as the only man 
capable of defea
ting Napoleon.�
��  But next d
ay no news arriv
ed from the army
 and the public 
mood grew anxio
us. The courtier
s suffered becau
se of the suffer
ing the suspense
 occasioned the
 Emperor.  “
Fancy the Empero
r’s position!�
"�� said they, an"
d instead of ext
olling Kutúzov
 as they had don
e the day before
", they condemned"
 him as the caus
e of the Empero
r’s anxiety. T
hat day Prince V
asíli no longer
 boasted of his
 protégé Kutú
"zov, but remaine"
d silent when th
e commander in c
hief was mentio
"ned. Moreover, t"
"oward evening, a"
s if everything 
conspired to mak
e Petersburg so
ciety anxious an
"d uneasy, a terr"
ible piece of ne
ws was added. C
ountess Hélène
 Bezúkhova had 
suddenly died of
 that terrible 
malady it had be
en so agreeable 
to mention. Offi
"cially, at large"
"
gatherings, ev"
eryone said that
 Countess Bezúk
hova had died of
 a terrible att
ack of angina pe
"ctoris, but in i"
ntimate circles 
details were me
ntioned of how t
he private physi
cian of the Quee
n of Spain had 
prescribed small
 doses of a cert
ain drug to prod
uce a certain ef
fect; but Hél�
"�ne, tortured by"
 the fact that t
he old count sus
pected her and 
that her husband
 to whom she had
 written (that w
"retched, proflig"
ate Pierre) had
" not replied, ha"
d suddenly taken
 a very large do
"se of the
drug,"
 and had died in
 agony before as
sistance could b
e rendered her. 
 It was said tha
t Prince Vasíli
 and the old cou
nt had turned up
"on the
Italian,"
 but the latter 
had produced suc
h letters from t
he unfortunate 
deceased that th
ey had immediate
ly let the matte
r drop.  Talk 
in general cente
red round three 
melancholy facts
: the Emperor’
"s
lack of news,"
 the loss of Kut
"áysov, and the "
death of Hélèn
e.  On the thi
rd day after Kut
úzov’s report
 a country gentl
eman arrived fro
"m
Moscow, and n"
ews of the surre
nder of Moscow t
o the French spr
ead through the
 whole town. Thi
s was terrible! 
What a position 
for the Emperor 
to be in! Kutú
zov was a traito
"r, and Prince Va"
síli during the
 visits of cond
olence paid to h
im on the occasi
on of his daught
er’s death sai
"d of
Kutúzov, "
whom he had form
erly praised (it
 was excusable f
or him in his g
rief to forget w
hat he had said)
", that it was im"
possible to expe
ct anything els
e from a blind a
nd depraved old 
man.  “I onl
y wonder that th
e fate of Russia
 could have been
 entrusted to su
ch a man.”  
 As long as this
 news remained u
nofficial it was
 possible to dou
"bt it,
but the "
next day the fol
lowing communica
tion was receive
d from Count Ro
stopchín:  Pr
ince Kutúzov’
s adjutant has b
rought me a lett
er in which he d
emands police o
fficers to guide
 the army to the
 Ryazán road. H
e writes that h
e is regretfully
 abandoning Mosc
ow. Sire! Kutúz
ov’s action de
cides the fate 
of the capital a
nd of your empir
e! Russia will s
hudder to learn 
of the abandonm
ent of the city 
in which her gre
atness is center
ed and in which
 lie the ashes o
f your ancestors
! I shall follow
 the army. I hav
e had everythin
"g removed, and i"
t only remains f
or me to weep ov
er the fate of 
my fatherland. 
 On receiving t
his dispatch the
 Emperor sent Pr
ince Volkónski 
to Kutúzov wit
h the following 
rescript:  Pri
nce Michael Ilar
iónovich! Since
 the twenty-nint
h of August I ha
ve received no 
communication fr
"om you, yet on t"
he first of Sept
ember I receive
d from the comma
nder in chief of
" Moscow, via Yar"
"oslávl, the sad"
"
news that you,"
" with the army, "
have decided to 
abandon Moscow. 
You can yoursel
f imagine the ef
fect this news h
"as had on me, an"
d your silence 
increases my ast
onishment. I am 
sending this by 
Adjutant-General
 Prince Volkón
"ski, to hear fro"
m you the situat
ion of the army 
and the reasons 
 that have induc
ed you to take t
his melancholy d
ecision.    
  CHAPTER III 
  Nine days aft
er the abandonme
"nt of Moscow, a "
messenger from K
utúzov reached
 Petersburg with
 the official an
nouncement of th
at event. This 
messenger was Mi
"chaud, a Frenchm"
an who did not k
"now Russian, but"
 who was quoiqu
"e étranger, rus"
se de cœur et d
"’âme, * as he"
 said of himself
.      * Thoug
"h a foreigner, R"
ussian in heart 
and soul.  The
 Emperor at once
 received this m
essenger in his 
study at the pal
ace on Stone Is
"land. Michaud, w"
ho had never see
n Moscow before 
the campaign an
d who did not kn
"ow Russian, yet "
felt deeply move
d (as he wrote) 
when he appeare
d before notre t
rès gracieux so
uverain * with t
he news of the 
burning of Mosco
"w, dont les flam"
mes éclairaient
 sa route. *(2) 
       * Our mo
st gracious sove
reign.       *
 (2) Whose flame
s illumined his 
route.  Though
 the source of M
. Michaud’s ch
agrin must have 
been different f
rom that which 
caused Russians 
"to grieve, he ha"
d such a sad fac
e when shown in
to the Emperor�
�s study that th
e latter at once
 asked:  “Ha
ve you brought m
"e sad news, Colo"
nel?”  “Ve
"ry sad, sire,”"
 replied Michaud
", lowering his e"
yes with a sigh.
 “The abandon
ment of Moscow.�
��  “Have th
ey surrendered m
y ancient capita
l without a batt
le?” asked the
 Emperor quickl
"y, his face sudd"
enly flushing. 
 Michaud respec
tfully delivered
 the message Kut
úzov had entrus
"ted to him,
whi"
ch was that it h
ad been impossib
le to fight befo
"re Moscow, and t"
hat as the only
 remaining choic
e was between lo
sing the army as
 well as Moscow
", or losing Mosc"
"ow alone, the fi"
eld marshal had 
to choose the l
atter.  The Em
peror listened i
"n silence, not l"
ooking at Michau
d.  “Has the
 enemy entered t
he city?” he a
"sked.

“Yes,"
" sire, and Mosco"
w is now in ashe
s. I left it all
" in flames,”
"
replied Michaud 
in a decided ton
"e, but glancing "
at the Emperor h
e was frightene
d by what he had
 done.  The Em
peror began to b
reathe heavily a
"nd rapidly, his "
lower lip tremb
"led, and tears i"
nstantly appeare
d in his fine bl
ue eyes.  But 
this lasted only
 a moment. He su
"ddenly frowned, "
as if blaming h
imself for his w
"eakness, and rai"
sing his head ad
dressed Michaud 
in a firm voice
":

“I see, C"
"olonel, from all"
 that is happeni
"ng, that Provide"
nce requires gr
eat sacrifices o
f us... I am rea
dy to submit mys
elf in all thing
s to His will; 
"but tell me, Mic"
"haud, how did yo"
u leave the army
 when it saw my
 ancient capital
 abandoned witho
ut a battle? Did
 you not notice 
 discouragement?
...”  Seeing
 that his most g
racious ruler wa
s calm once more
", Michaud also
"
"grew calm, but w"
as not immediate
ly ready to repl
y to the Emperor
’s direct and
 relevant questi
on which require
d a direct answe
"r.

“Sire, w"
ill you allow me
 to speak frankl
y as befits a lo
yal soldier?” 
he asked to gai
n time.  “Co
"lonel, I always "
"require it,” r"
eplied the Emper
or. “Conceal n
"othing
from me,"
 I wish to know 
absolutely how t
hings are.”  
 “Sire!” sai
d Michaud with a
" subtle, scarcel"
y perceptible sm
ile on his lips
", having now pre"
pared a well-phr
"ased reply, “s"
"ire, I left the"
"
whole army, fro"
m its chiefs to 
the lowest soldi
"er, without exce"
ption in desper
ate and agonized
 terror...”  
 “How is that?
” the Emperor 
"interrupted him,"
 frowning sternl
y. “Would mis
fortune make my 
Russians lose he
art?... Never!�
�  Michaud had
 only waited for
 this to bring o
ut the phrase he
 had prepared. 
"

“Sire,” h"
"e said, with res"
pectful playfuln
"ess, “they are"
 only afraid les
"t
Your Majesty,"
 in the goodness
" of your heart, "
should allow you
rself to be per
suaded to make p
eace. They are b
urning for the c
"ombat,” declar"
ed this represe
ntative of the R
"ussian nation, �"
��and to prove t
o Your Majesty b
y the sacrifice
 of their lives 
how devoted they
 are....”  �
��Ah!” said th
e Emperor reassu
"red, and with a "
kindly gleam in 
"his eyes,
he pa"
tted Michaud on 
the shoulder. �
�You set me at e
"ase, Colonel.”"
  He bent his 
head and was sil
ent for some tim
"e.

“Well, t"
"hen, go back to "
"the army,” he "
"said, drawing hi"
mself up to his 
 full height and
 addressing Mich
aud with a graci
ous and majestic
" gesture,
“an"
d tell our brave
 men and all my 
good subjects wh
erever you go th
at when I have 
not a soldier le
ft I shall put m
yself at the hea
d of my beloved
 nobility and my
 good peasants a
nd so use the la
st resources of 
 my empire. It s
till offers me m
ore than my enem
"ies suppose,” "
said the Empero
r growing more a
nd more animated
; “but should 
it ever be ordai
ned by Divine P
"rovidence,” he"
" continued, rais"
ing to heaven hi
s fine eyes shi
ning with emotio
"n, “that my dy"
nasty should cea
se to reign on t
he throne of my
" ancestors, then"
 after exhaustin
g all the means 
"at my

I shall let my b

 halfway down hi
s chest) “and

anest of my peas
"ants, rather
th"
an sign the disg

know how to appr
eciate.”  Ha
ving uttered the
se words in an a
gitated voice th
e Emperor sudden
ly turned away 
as if to hide fr
om Michaud the t
ears that rose t
"o his eyes,
and"
 went to the fur
ther end of his 
study. Having st
ood there a few 
"
moments, he str"
ode back to Mich
aud and pressed 
his arm below th
e elbow with a 
vigorous movemen
t. The Emperor�
�s mild and hand
some face was f
lushed and his e
yes gleamed with
 resolution and 
anger.  “Col
"onel Michaud, do"
 not forget what
 I say to you he
"re, perhaps we m"
ay recall it wi
th pleasure some
day... Napoleon 
"or I,” said th"
"e Emperor,
touc"
hing his breast.
 “We can no lo
nger both reign 
together. I have
 learned to kno
"w him, and he wi"
ll not deceive m
e any more....�
�  And the Emp
"eror paused, wit"
h a frown.  Wh
en he heard thes
e words and saw 
the expression o
f firm resolutio
n in the Empero
"r’s eyes, Mich"
aud—quoique é
"tranger, russe d"
e cœur et d’�
"�me,—at
that "
solemn moment fe
lt himself enrap
tured by all tha
t he had heard (
as he used afte
"rwards to say), "
and gave express
ion to his own f
eelings and tho
se of the Russia
n people whose r
epresentative he
 considered hims
"elf
to be, in t"
he following wor
ds:  “Sire!�
"�� said he, “Y"
our Majesty is a
t this moment si
gning the glory 
of the nation a
nd the salvation
 of Europe!” 
 With an inclin
ation of the hea
d the Emperor di
smissed him.  
    CHAPTER 
IV  It is natu
ral for us who w
ere not living i
n those days to 
imagine that wh
en half Russia h
ad been conquere
d and the inhabi
tants were fleei
ng to distant p
"rovinces, and on"
e levy after ano
ther was being r
aised for the d
efense of the fa
"therland, all Ru"
ssians from the 
greatest to the 
least were sole
ly engaged in sa
crificing themse
"lves, saving the"
"ir fatherland,
"
or weeping over 
its downfall. Th
e tales and desc
riptions of that
 time without e
xception speak o
nly of the self-
"sacrifice, patri"
"otic devotion,
"
"despair, grief, "
and the heroism 
of the Russians.
 But it was not 
really so. It a
ppears so to us 
because we see o
nly the general 
historic intere
st of that time 
and do not see a
ll the personal 
human interests 
 that people had
. Yet in reality
 those personal 
interests of the
 moment so much
 transcend the g
eneral interests
 that they alway
s prevent the p
ublic interest f
rom being felt o
r even noticed. 
Most of the peop
le at that time
 paid no attenti
on to the genera
l progress of ev
ents but were g
uided only by th
eir private inte
"rests, and they "
were the very pe
ople whose acti
vities at that p
eriod were most 
useful.  Those
 who tried to un
derstand the gen
eral course of e
vents and to tak
e part in it by
 self-sacrifice 
and heroism were
 the most useles
s members of so
"ciety, they saw "
everything upsid
"e down, and all "
they did for the
 common good tu
rned out to be u
seless and fooli
sh—like Pierre
’s and Mamón
ov’s regiments
 which looted Ru
"ssian villages, "
and the lint the
 young ladies p
repared and that
 never reached t
"he wounded, and "
so on. Even tho
"se, fond of inte"
llectual talk an
d of expressing 
"their feelings,"
 who discussed R
ussia’s positi
on at the time i
nvoluntarily int
roduced into th
eir conversation
 either a shade 
of pretense and 
falsehood or us
eless condemnati
on and anger dir
ected against pe
ople accused of 
 actions no one 
could possibly b
e guilty of. In 
historic events 
the rule forbid
ding us to eat o
f the fruit of t
he Tree of Knowl
edge is speciall
y applicable. O
nly unconscious 
action bears fru
"it, and he who p"
lays a part in 
an historic even
t never understa
nds its signific
ance. If he trie
s to realize it
 his efforts are
 fruitless.  T
he more closely 
a man was engage
d in the events 
then taking plac
e in Russia the
 less did he rea
lize their signi
ficance. In Pete
rsburg and in t
he provinces at 
a distance from 
"Moscow, ladies, "
and gentlemen in
 militia unifor
"ms, wept for Rus"
sia and its anci
ent capital and 
talked of self-
sacrifice and so
 on; but in the 
army which retir
ed beyond Moscow
 there was litt
le talk or thoug
"ht of Moscow, an"
d when they caug
ht sight of its
 burned ruins no
 one swore to be
 avenged on the 
"French, but they"
 thought about 
"their next pay, "
their next quart
"ers, of Matrësh"
ka the vivandi�
"�re, and like ma"
tters.  As the
 war had caught 
him in the servi
"ce, Nicholas Ros"
tóv took a clos
e and prolonged
 part in the def
ense of his coun
"try, but did so "
"casually,
witho"
ut any aim at se
"lf-sacrifice, an"
d he therefore l
ooked at what wa
s going on in R
ussia without de
spair and withou
t dismally racki
ng his brains o
ver it. Had he b
een asked what h
e thought of the
 state of Russi
"a, he would have"
 said that it wa
s not his busine
ss to think abou
"t
it, that Kut�"
�zov and others 
were there for t
"hat purpose, but"
 that he had he
ard that the reg
iments were to b
e made up to the
ir full strength
", that
fighting"
 would probably 
go on for a long
" time yet, and t"
hat things being
 so it was quit
e likely he migh
t be in command 
of a regiment in
 a couple of ye
ars’ time.  
As he looked at 
the matter in th
"is way, he learn"
ed that he was b
eing sent to Vo
rónezh to buy r
emounts for his 
"division, not on"
ly without regr
et at being prev
ented from takin
g part in the co
"ming battle, but"
 with the great
est pleasure—w
hich he did not 
conceal and whic
h his comrades 
fully understood
.  A few days 
before the battl
"e of Borodinó, "
Nicholas receive
d the necessary
 money and warra
"nts, and having "
sent some hussar
s on in advance
", he set out wit"
h post horses fo
r Vorónezh.  
Only a man who h
as experienced i
"t—that is, has"
 passed some mon
ths continuousl
y in an atmosphe
re of campaignin
g and war—can 
understand the 
delight Nicholas
 felt when he es
caped from the r
egion covered by
 the army’s f
oraging operatio
"ns, provision tr"
"ains, and hospit"
als. When—free
"
from soldiers,"
" wagons, and the"
 filthy traces o
f a camp—he sa
w villages with
 peasants and pe
"asant women, gen"
tlemen’s count
"ry houses, field"
s where cattle 
"were grazing, po"
sthouses with st
ationmasters asl
"eep in
them, he"
 rejoiced as tho
ugh seeing all t
his for the firs
t time. What for
 a long while s
pecially surpris
ed and delighted
 him were the wo
"men, young
and "
"healthy, without"
 a dozen officer
s making up to e
ach of them; wom
"en,
too, who we"
re pleased and f
lattered that a 
passing officer 
should joke wit
h them.  In th
e highest spirit
s Nicholas arriv
ed at night at a
 hotel in Vorón
"ezh,
ordered th"
ings he had long
 been deprived o
"f in camp, and n"
"ext day, very
c"
lean-shaven and 
in a full-dress 
uniform he had n
ot worn for a lo
"ng
time, went t"
o present himsel
f to the authori
ties.  The com
mander of the mi
litia was a civi
"lian general, an"
 old man who was
 evidently plea
sed with his mil
itary designatio
n and rank. He r
eceived Nichola
s brusquely (ima
gining this to b
e characteristic
ally military) 
and questioned h
im with an impor
"tant air, as if "
considering the 
general progres
s of affairs and
 approving and d
isapproving with
 full right to d
o so. Nicholas 
was in such good
 spirits that th
is merely amused
 him.  From th
e commander of t
he militia he dr
ove to the gover
nor. The governo
r was a brisk l
"ittle man, very "
simple and affab
le. He indicated
 the stud farms
 at which Nichol
as might procure
" horses, recomme"
nded to him a ho
rse dealer in t
he town and a la
ndowner fourteen
 miles out of to
wn who had the 
"best horses, and"
 promised to ass
ist him in every
 way.  “You 
are Count Ilyá 
Rostóv’s son?
 My wife was a g
reat friend of y
our mother’s.
 We are at home 
on Thursdays—t
oday is Thursday

 and see us qui
"te informally,�"
� said the gover
"nor, taking leav"
e of him.  Imm
ediately on leav

ired post horses
" and,
taking hi"
s squadron quart
ermaster with hi
"m, drove at a ga"
llop to the lan
"downer, fourteen"

 had the stud. E
verything seemed
 to him pleasan
t and easy durin
g that first par
t of his stay in
" Vorónezh
and,"
 as usually happ
ens when a man i
s in a pleasant 
"state of mind,
"
everything went 
well and easily.
  The landowne
r to whom Nichol
as went was a ba
"chelor, an old c"
"avalryman, a
ho"
"rse fancier, a s"
"portsman, the po"
ssessor of some 
century-old bran
dy and some old
" Hungarian wine,"
 who had a snugg
ery where he smo
"ked, and who
ow"
ned some splendi
d horses.  In 
very few words N
icholas bought s
eventeen picked 
stallions for si
x thousand rubl
"es—to serve, a"
"s he said, as sa"
mples of his rem
ounts. After di
ning and taking 
rather too much 
of the Hungarian
" wine, Nicholas�"
��having exchan
ged kisses with 
"the landowner, w"
ith whom he was 
already on the 
friendliest term
s—galloped bac
k over abominabl
"e roads, in the "
brightest frame
" of mind, contin"
ually urging on 
the driver so as
 to be in time f
or the governor
’s party.  W
hen he had chang
"ed, poured water"
" over his head, "
and scented hims
"elf,
Nicholas a"
rrived at the go
vernor’s rathe
"r late, but with"
 the phrase “
better late than
 never” on his
 lips.  It was
" not a ball, nor"
 had dancing bee
"n announced, but"
 everyone knew 
that Catherine P
etróvna would p
lay valses and t
he écossaise on
 the clavichord
 and that there 
would be dancing
", and so everyon"
e had come as t
o a ball.  Pro
vincial life in 
1812 went on ver
"y much as usual,"
 but with this 
"difference, that"
 it was livelier
 in the towns in
 consequence of 
the arrival of 
many wealthy fam
ilies from Mosco
"w, and as in eve"
rything that we
nt on in Russia 
at that time a s
pecial recklessn
ess was noticeab
"le, an
“in fo"
"r a penny, in fo"

cares?” spirit
", and the inevit"
able small talk
", instead of tur"
ning on the weat
her and mutual a
"cquaintances,
n"
ow turned on Mos
"cow, the army, a"
nd Napoleon.  
The society gath
ered together at
 the governor’
s was the best i
n Vorónezh.  
 There were a gr
eat many ladies 
and some of Nich
olas’ Moscow 
"acquaintances, b"
ut there were no
 men who could a
t all vie with t
he cavalier of 
"St. George, the "
hussar remount o
"fficer, the good"
-natured and we
ll-bred Count Ro
stóv. Among the
 men was an Ital
"ian prisoner, an"
 officer of the
 French army; an
d Nicholas felt 
that the presenc
e of that priso
ner enhanced his
 own importance 
as a Russian her
o. The Italian 
"was, as it were,"
 a war trophy. N
icholas felt thi
"s, it seemed to "
him that everyo
ne regarded the 
Italian in the s
"ame light, and h"
e treated him c
ordially though 
with dignity and
 restraint.  A
s soon as Nichol
as entered in hi
s hussar uniform
", diffusing arou"
nd him a fragra
nce of perfume a
"nd wine, and had"
 uttered the wor
ds “better lat
e than never”
 and heard them 
repeated several
 times by others
", people
cluste"
red around him; 
all eyes turned 
"on him, and he f"
elt at once tha
t he had entered
 into his proper
 position in the
 province—that
 of a universal
 favorite: a ver
y pleasant posit
"ion, and intoxic"
atingly so afte
r his long priva
tions. At postin
"g stations, at i"
"nns, and in the"
 landowner’s s
"nuggery, maidser"
vants had been f
lattered by his 
"notice, and
her"
e too at the gov
ernor’s party 
there were (as i
t seemed to Nich
olas) an inexha
ustible number o
f pretty young w
"omen, married an"
"d unmarried,
im"
patiently awaiti
ng his notice. T
he women and gir
ls flirted with 
"him
and, from t"
"he first day, th"
e people concern
ed themselves to
 get this fine 
young daredevil 
of an hussar mar
ried and settled
 down. Among the
se was the gove
rnor’s wife he
"rself, who welco"
med Rostóv as a
 near relative 
and called him �
��Nicholas.” 
 Catherine Petr
óvna did actual
ly play valses a
nd the écossais
"e, and
dancing "
began in which N
icholas still fu
rther captivated
 the provincial 
 society by his 
agility. His par
ticularly free m
anner of dancing
 even surprised
 them all. Nicho
las was himself 
rather surprised
 at the way he 
danced that even
ing. He had neve
r danced like th
at in Moscow and
 would even hav
e considered suc
h a very free an
d easy manner im
proper and in b
"ad form, but her"
e he felt it inc
umbent on him to
 astonish them a
ll by something
" unusual, someth"
ing they would h
ave to accept as
 the regular th
ing in the capit
al though new to
 them in the pro
vinces.  All t
he evening Nicho
las paid attenti
on to a blue-eye
"d, plump and
pl"
easing little bl
"onde, the wife o"
f one of the pro
vincial official
s. With the na�
�ve conviction o
f young men in a
 merry mood that
 other men’s 
wives were creat
"ed for them, Ros"
tóv did not lea
ve the lady’s 
side and treate
d her husband in
 a friendly and 
conspiratorial s
"tyle, as if,
wi"
thout speaking o
"f it, they knew "
how capitally Ni
cholas and the l
ady would get o
n together. The 
"husband, however"
", did not seem t"
o share that co
nviction and tri
ed to behave mor
osely with Rost�
�v. But the lat
ter’s good-nat
ured naïveté w
as so boundless 
that sometimes e
ven he involunt
arily yielded to
 Nicholas’ goo
d humor. Toward 
the end of the 
"evening, however"
", as the wife’"
s face grew more
 flushed and ani
"mated, the
husb"
and’s became m
ore and more mel
ancholy and sole
"mn, as though th"
ere were but a 
given amount of 
animation betwee
n them and as th
e wife’s shar
e increased the 
husband’s dimi
nished.     
  CHAPTER V  
Nicholas sat lea
ning slightly fo
rward in an armc
"hair, bending cl"
osely over the 
blonde lady and 
paying her mytho
logical complime
nts with a smil
e that never lef
t his face. Jaun
tily shifting th
e position of hi
s legs in their
 tight riding br
"eeches, diffusin"
g an odor of per
"fume, and
admir"
"ing his partner,"
" himself, and th"
e fine outlines 
of his legs in 
their well-fitti
ng Hessian boots
", Nicholas told "
the blonde lady 
that he wished 
to run away with
 a certain lady 
here in Vorónez
h.  “Which l
ady?”  “A 
"charming lady, a"
 divine one. Her
 eyes” (Nichol
as looked at his
 partner) “ar
"e blue, her mout"
h coral and ivor
y; her figure”
 (he glanced at
 her shoulders) 
“like Diana’
s....”  The 
husband came up 
and sullenly ask
ed his wife what
 she was talking
 about.  “A
"h, Nikíta Iván"
ych!” cried Ni
"cholas, rising p"
"olitely, and as "
if wishing Nik�
�ta Iványch to 
"share his joke, "
he began to tell
 him of his inte
ntion to elope 
with a blonde la
dy.  The husba
nd smiled gloomi
"ly, the wife gai"
ly. The governor
’s good-nature
d wife came up 
with a look of d
isapproval.  �
��Anna Ignátyev
na wants to see 
"you, Nicholas,�"
"� said she, pron"
ouncing the nam
e so that Nichol
as at once under
stood that Anna 
Ignátyevna was 
a very importan
t person. “Com
"e, Nicholas! You"
 know you let me
 call you so?”
"

“Oh, yes, "
Aunt. Who is she
?”  “Anna 
Ignátyevna Malv
íntseva. She ha
s heard from her
 niece how you 
rescued her.... 
Can you guess?�
�  “I rescue
d such a lot of 
them!” said Ni
cholas.  “He
"r niece, Princes"
s Bolkónskaya. 
She is here in V
orónezh with he
r aunt. Oho! Ho
w you blush. Why
", are...?”

"
“Not a bit! Pl
"ease don’t, Au"
nt!”  “Ver
"y well, very wel"
"l!... Oh, what a"
 fellow you are!
”  The gover
nor’s wife led
 him up to a tal
l and very stout
 old lady with 
a blue headdress
", who had just f"
inished her game
 of cards with t
he most importa
nt personages of
 the town. This 
was Malvíntseva
", Princess Mary�"
��s aunt on her
 mother’s side
", a rich, childl"
ess widow who al
ways lived in V
orónezh. When R
ostóv approache
d her she was st
anding settling 
up for the game
. She looked at 
"him and, screwin"
g up her eyes st
"ernly, continued"
 to upbraid the
 general who had
 won from her. 
 “Very please
"d, mon cher,” "
"she then said, h"
olding out her h
and to Nicholas
. “Pray come a
nd see me.”  
 After a few wor
ds about Princes
s Mary and her l
"ate father, whom"
 Malvíntseva h
ad evidently not
" liked, and havi"
ng asked what Ni
cholas knew of 
"Prince Andrew, w"
ho also was evid
ently no favorit
"e of hers, the
"
important old la
dy dismissed Nic
holas after repe
ating her invita
tion to come to
 see her.  Nic
holas promised t
o come and blush
ed again as he b
owed. At the men
tion of Princes
s Mary he experi
enced a feeling 
of shyness and e
"ven of fear,
wh"
ich he himself d
id not understan
d.  When he ha
d parted from Ma
lvíntseva Nicho
las wished to re
turn to the dan
"cing, but the go"
vernor’s littl
e wife placed he
r plump hand on 
"his
sleeve and,"
 saying that she
 wanted to have 
"a talk with him,"
 led him to her
" sitting room, f"
rom which those 
who were there i
mmediately withd
rew so as not t
o be in her way.
  “Do you kn
"ow, dear boy,”"
 began the gover
nor’s wife wit
h a serious exp
ression on her k
"ind little face,"
 “that really 
would be the mat
ch for you: wou
ld you like me t
o arrange it?”
  “Whom do y
"ou mean, Aunt?�"
� asked Nicholas
.  “I will m
ake a match for 
you with the pri
ncess. Catherine
 Petróvna spea
"ks of Lily, but "
"I say, no—the "
princess! Do you
 want me to do i
t? I am sure yo
ur mother will b
e grateful to me
. What a charmin
"g girl she is,
"
really! And she 
is not at all so
" plain, either.�"
��  “Not at 
"all,” replied "
Nicholas as if o
ffended at the i
dea. “As befit
"s
a soldier, Au"
"nt, I don’t fo"
rce myself on an
yone or refuse a
"nything,” he
"
said before he h
ad time to consi
der what he was 
saying.  “We
"ll then, remembe"
"r, this is not a"
 joke!”  “
Of course not!�
"�

“Yes, yes"
",” the governo"
r’s wife said 
as if talking to
 herself. “But
",
my dear boy, "
among other thin
gs you are too a
ttentive to the 
"other, the
blon"
de. One is sorry
 for the husband
", really....”"
"

“Oh no, we "
are good friends
" with him,” sa"
id Nicholas in t
he simplicity o
f his heart; it 
did not enter hi
s head that a pa
stime so pleasan
t to himself mi
ght not be pleas
ant to someone e
lse.  “But w
hat nonsense I h
ave been saying 
to the governor�
��s wife!” tho
ught Nicholas s
uddenly at suppe
r. “She will r
eally begin to a
rrange a match.
.. and Sónya...
?” And on taki
ng leave of the 
governor’s wif
"e,
when she aga"
in smilingly sai
"d to him, “Wel"
"l then, remember"
!” he drew her
 aside.  “B
"ut see here, to "
"tell the truth, "
Aunt...”  �
"�What is it, my "
"dear? Come, let�"
��s sit down her
"e,” said she."
  Nicholas sudd
enly felt a desi
re and need to t
ell his most int
imate thoughts 
(which he would 
not have told to
" his mother, his"
" sister, or
his"
 friend) to this
 woman who was a
lmost a stranger
. When he afterw
ards recalled t
hat impulse to u
nsolicited and i
nexplicable fran
kness which had
 very important 
"results for him,"
 it seemed to hi
m—as it seems 
to everyone in 
such cases—tha
t it was merely 
some silly whim 
that seized him
: yet that burst
" of frankness, t"
ogether with oth
er trifling even
"ts,
had immense"
 consequences fo
r him and for al
l his family.  
"
“You see, Aun"
"t, Mamma has lon"
g wanted me to m
"arry an heiress,"
 but the very i
dea of marrying 
for money is rep
ugnant to me.”
"

“Oh yes, I"
" understand,” "
said the governo
r’s wife.  �
��But Princess B

" very much, I fe"

had long been th
inking of it; bu
t I had never ha
ppened to meet h

how it had alway

 And as long as

t was of course 
out of the ques

  “My dear b

 Your mother in

" No, my dear, yo"

cholas remained 
silent. It comfo
rted him to hear
 these arguments
.  “All the

"s impossible,”"
 he rejoined wit
"h a sigh, after"
 a short pause. 
"“Besides, woul"

But you don’t

 replied the gov

   CHAPTER VI
  On reaching 
Moscow after her
 meeting with Ro
"stóv, Princess "
Mary had found 
her nephew there
" with his tutor,"
 and a letter fr
om Prince Andrew
 giving her ins
tructions how to
 get to her Aunt
 Malvíntseva at
 Vorónezh. Tha
t feeling akin t
o temptation whi
ch had tormented
 her during her 
 father’s illn
"ess, since his d"
"eath, and especi"
ally since her m
eeting with Ros
tóv was smother
ed by arrangemen
ts for the journ
"ey, anxiety abou"
"t her
brother, "
settling in a ne
"w house, meeting"
" new people, and"
 attending to h
er nephew’s ed
ucation. She was
" sad. Now, after"
 a month passed 
in quiet surrou
"ndings, she felt"
 more and more d
eeply the loss o
f her father whi
ch was associat
ed in her mind w
ith the ruin of 
Russia. She was 
agitated and in
cessantly tortur
ed by the though
t of the dangers
 to which her br
"other,
the only"
 intimate person
 now remaining t
"o her, was expos"
ed. She was wor
ried too about h
er nephew’s ed
ucation for whic
h she had always
 felt herself i
"ncompetent, but "
in the depths of
 her soul she fe
lt at peace—a 
 peace arising f
rom consciousnes
s of having stif
led those person
al dreams and h
opes that had be
en on the point 
of awakening wit
hin her and were
 related to her
 meeting with Ro
stóv.  The da
y after her part
y the governor�
�s wife came to 
see Malvíntseva
"
and, after dis"
cussing her plan
" with the aunt, "
remarked that th
ough under pres
ent circumstance
s a formal betro
"thal was, of cou"
"rse, not to be
"
"thought of, all "
the same the you
ng people might 
be brought toget
her and could g
et to know one a
nother. Malvínt
seva expressed a
"pproval, and the"
 governor’s w
ife began to spe
ak of Rostóv in
 Mary’s presen
"ce, praising
hi"
m and telling ho
w he had blushed
 when Princess M
ary’s name was
 mentioned. But
 Princess Mary e
xperienced a pai
nful rather than
 a joyful feeli
ng—her mental 
tranquillity was
" destroyed, and "
"desires, doubts,"
"
self-reproach,"
 and hopes reawo
ke.  During th
e two days that 
elapsed before R
"ostóv called, P"
rincess Mary co
ntinually though
t of how she oug
ht to behave to 
him. First she d
ecided not to c
ome to the drawi
ng room when he 
called to see he
r aunt—that it
 would not be p
"roper for her, i"
n her deep mourn
"ing, to receive "
visitors; then 
she thought this
 would be rude a
fter what he had
 done for her; t
hen it occurred
 to her that her
 aunt and the go
vernor’s wife 
had intentions 
concerning herse
lf and Rostóv�
�their looks and
 words at times 
seemed to confi
rm this supposit
ion—then she t
old herself that
" only she, with "
her sinful natu
"re, could think "
this of them: th
ey could not for
get that situat
"ed as she was, w"
hile still weari
ng deep mourning
", such matchmaki"
ng would be an 
insult to her an
d to her father�
��s memory. Assu
ming that she d
id go down to se
"e him, Princess "
Mary imagined th
e words he would
 say to her and
 what she would 
"say to him, and "
these words some
times seemed un
deservedly cold 
and then to mean
 too much. More 
than anything sh
e feared lest t
he confusion she
 felt might over
whelm her and be
tray her as soo
n as she saw him
.  But when on
 Sunday after ch
urch the footman
 announced in th
e drawing room 
that Count Rost�
"�v had called, t"
he princess show
"ed no confusion,"
 only a slight 
blush suffused h
er cheeks and he
r eyes lit up wi
th a new and ra
diant light.  
“You have met 
"him, Aunt?” sa"
id she in a calm
" voice, unable h"
erself to under
stand that she c
ould be outwardl
y so calm and na
tural.  When R
ostóv entered t
"he room, the pri"
ncess dropped he
r eyes for an i
"nstant, as if to"
 give the visito
r time to greet 
"her aunt, and th"
en just as Nich
olas turned to h
er she raised he
r head and met h
is look with sh
ining eyes. With
 a movement full
 of dignity and 
grace she half r
ose with a smil
"e of pleasure, h"
eld out her slen
"der, delicate ha"
"nd to him,
and "
began to speak i
n a voice in whi
ch for the first
 time new deep 
womanly notes vi
brated. Mademois
"elle Bourienne, "
who was in the d
"rawing
room, lo"
oked at Princess
 Mary in bewilde
red surprise. He
rself a consumm
"ate coquette, sh"
e could not have
 maneuvered bett
er on meeting a 
 man she wished 
to attract.  �
��Either black i
s particularly b
ecoming to her o
r she really has
 greatly improv
ed without my ha
ving noticed it.
" And above all, "
what tact and g
race!” thought
 Mademoiselle Bo
urienne.  Had 
Princess Mary be
en capable of re
flection at that
" moment, she wou"
ld have been mo
re surprised tha
n Mademoiselle B
ourienne at the 
change that had
 taken place in 
herself. From th
e moment she rec
ognized that dea
"r,
loved face, "
a new life force
 took possession
 of her and comp
elled her to sp
eak and act apar
t from her own w
ill. From the ti
me Rostóv enter
"ed, her
face be"
came suddenly tr
ansformed. It wa
s as if a light 
had been kindled
 in a carved an
d painted lanter
n and the intric
"ate, skillful, a"
rtistic work on
" its sides, that"
 previously seem
"ed dark, coarse,"
 and meaningless
",
was suddenly "
shown up in unex
pected and strik
ing beauty. For 
the first time 
"all that pure, s"
"piritual, inward"
 travail through
 which she had 
lived appeared o
n the surface. A
ll her inward la
"bor, her dissati"
sfaction with h
"erself, her suff"
"erings, her stri"
vings after good
"ness, her
meekn"
"ess, love, and s"
elf-sacrifice—
all this now sho
ne in those radi
"ant
eyes, in he"
r delicate smile
", and in every t"
rait of her gent
le face.  Rost
óv saw all this
 as clearly as i
f he had known h
er whole life. H
e felt that the
 being before hi
m was quite diff
"erent from, and "
"better
than, an"
yone he had met 
"before, and abov"
e all better tha
n himself.  Th
eir conversation
 was very simple
 and unimportant
. They spoke of 
"the
war, and li"
ke everyone else
 unconsciously e
xaggerated their
 sorrow about i
t; they spoke of
 their last meet
ing—Nicholas t
rying to change 
the subject—t
hey talked of th
e governor’s k
"ind wife, of Nic"
holas’ relatio
"ns,
and of Prin"
cess Mary’s. 
 She did not ta
lk about her bro
"ther, diverting "
the conversation
 as soon as her
 aunt mentioned 
Andrew. Evidentl
y she could spea
k of Russia’s 
 misfortunes wit
h a certain arti
"ficiality, but h"
er brother was t
oo near her hea
rt and she neith
er could nor wou
ld speak lightly
 of him. Nichola
"s
noticed this,"
 as he noticed e
very shade of Pr
incess Mary’s 
character with 
an observation u
"nusual to him, a"
nd everything co
nfirmed his con
viction that she
 was a quite unu
sual and extraor
dinary being. N
icholas blushed 
and was confused
 when people spo
ke to him about 
the princess (a
s she did when h
e was mentioned)
 and even when h
e thought of he
"r, but in her pr"
esence he felt q
"uite at ease, an"
d said not at al
l what he had p
"repared, but wha"
"t, quite appropr"
"iately, occurred"
 to him at the 
moment.  When 
a pause occurred
 during his shor
"t visit, Nichola"
"s, as is usual w"
hen there are c
"hildren, turned "
to Prince Andrew
"’s little son,"
 caressing him 
and asking wheth
er he would like
 to be an hussar
. He took the bo
"y on
his knee, "
"played with him,"
 and looked roun
d at Princess Ma
ry. With a soft
"ened, happy, tim"
id look she watc
hed the boy she 
loved in the arm
s of the man sh
e loved. Nichola
s also noticed t
"hat look and, as"
 if understandi
"ng it, flushed w"
ith pleasure and
 began to kiss t
he boy with goo
d natured playfu
lness.  As she
 was in mourning
 Princess Mary d
id not go out in
"to society, and"
 Nicholas did no
t think it the p
roper thing to v
isit her again; 
but all the sam
e the governor�
�s wife went on 
with her matchma
"king, passing on"
 to Nicholas th
e flattering thi
ngs Princess Mar
y said of him an
"d vice
versa, a"
nd insisting on 
his declaring hi
mself to Princes
s Mary. For this
 purpose she ar
ranged a meeting
 between the you
ng people at the
 bishop’s hou
se before Mass. 
  Though Rostó
v told the gover
nor’s wife tha
t he would not m
ake any declara
tion to Princess
" Mary, he promis"
ed to go.  As 
at Tilsit Rostó
v had not allowe
d himself to dou
bt that what eve
rybody consider
ed right was rig
"ht, so now, afte"
r a short but si
ncere struggle 
between his effo
rt to arrange hi
s life by his ow
n sense of justi
"ce, and
in obed"
ient submission 
to circumstances
", he chose the l"
atter and yielde
d to the power 
he felt irresist
ibly carrying hi
m he knew not wh
ere. He knew th
at after his pro
mise to Sónya i
t would be what 
he deemed base t
o declare his f
eelings to Princ
ess Mary. And he
 knew that he wo
uld never act b
asely. But he al
so knew (or rath
er felt at the b
ottom of his hea
rt) that by res
igning himself n
ow to the force 
of circumstances
 and to those w
ho were guiding 
"him, he was not "
only doing nothi
"ng wrong, but wa"
s doing somethi
ng very importan
t—more importa
nt than anything
 he had ever don
e in his life. 
  After meeting
" Princess Mary, "
though the cours
e of his life we
nt on externall
"y as before, all"
 his former amus
ements lost thei
r charm for him 
 and he often th
ought about her.
 But he never th
ought about her 
as he had thoug
ht of all the yo
ung ladies witho
ut exception who
m he had met in
" society, nor as"
 he had for a lo
"ng time, and at "
one time rapturo
"usly,
thought a"
bout Sónya. He 
had pictured eac
h of those young
 ladies as almo
st all honest-he
arted young men 
"do, that is, as "
"a possible wife,"
 adapting her i
n his imaginatio
n to all the con
ditions of marri
ed life: a whit
"e dressing gown,"
 his wife at the
" tea table, his "
wife’s carriag
"e,
little ones,"
" Mamma and Papa,"
 their relations
" to her, and so "
on—and these 
pictures of the 
future had given
 him pleasure. B
ut with Princess
" Mary,
to whom "
they were trying
 to get him enga
"ged, he could ne"
ver picture any
thing of future 
married life. If
" he tried, his p"
ictures seemed 
incongruous and 
false. It made h
im afraid.   
   CHAPTER VI
I  The dreadfu
l news of the ba
ttle of Borodin�
"�, of our losses"
 in killed and 
"wounded, and the"
 still more terr
ible news of the
 loss of Moscow 
reached Voróne
zh in the middle
 of September. P
"rincess Mary, ha"
ving learned of 
 her brother’s
 wound only from
 the Gazette and
 having no defin
ite news of him
", prepared (so N"
"icholas heard, h"
e had not seen h
er again himself
) to set off in
 search of Princ
e Andrew.  Whe
n he received th
e news of the ba
ttle of Borodin�
� and the abando
nment of Moscow
", Rostóv was no"
t seized with de
"spair, anger, th"
e desire for ve
"ngeance, or any "
feeling of that 
"kind, but everyt"
hing in Vorónez
h suddenly seem
ed to him dull a
"nd tiresome, and"
 he experienced 
an indefinite f
eeling of shame 
and awkwardness.
 The conversatio
ns he heard see
med to him insin
cere; he did not
 know how to jud
ge all these aff
airs and felt t
hat only in the 
regiment would e
verything again 
become clear to
 him. He made ha
ste to finish bu
"ying the horses,"
 and often becam
e unreasonably 
angry with his s
ervant and squad
ron quartermaste
r.  A few days
 before his depa
rture a special 
"thanksgiving, at"
 which Nicholas
" was present, wa"
s held in the ca
thedral for the 
Russian victory.
 He stood a lit
tle behind the g
overnor and held
 himself with mi
litary decorum 
through the serv
"ice, meditating "
on a great varie
ty of subjects. 
 When the servic
e was over the g
overnor’s wife
 beckoned him to
 her.  “Have
 you seen the pr
incess?” she a
"sked, indicating"
 with a movement
 of her head a 
lady standing on
 the opposite si
"de, beyond the c"
hoir.  Nichola
s immediately re
cognized Princes
s Mary not so mu
ch by the profil
e he saw under 
her bonnet as by
 the feeling of 
"solicitude, timi"
"dity, and
pity "
that immediately
 overcame him. P
"rincess Mary, ev"
idently engrosse
d by her though
"ts, was crossing"
 herself for the
 last time befor
e leaving the c
hurch.  Nichol
as looked at her
 face with surpr
ise. It was the 
same face he had
"
seen before, t"
here was the sam
e general expres
"sion of refined,"
" inner,
spiritu"
"al labor, but no"
w it was quite d
ifferently lit u
p. There was a 
pathetic express
"ion of sorrow, p"
"rayer, and hope "
in it. As had oc
curred before w
hen she was pres
"ent, Nicholas we"
nt up to her wit
hout waiting to 
 be prompted by 
the governor’s
 wife and not as
king himself whe
ther or not it 
was right and pr
oper to address 
her here in chur
"ch, and told her"
 he had heard o
f her trouble an
d sympathized wi
th his whole sou
l. As soon as s
he heard his voi
ce a vivid glow 
kindled in her f
"ace, lighting up"
 both her sorro
w and her joy. 
 “There is on
e thing I wanted
" to tell you, Pr"
"incess,” said "
Rostóv. “It 
is that if your 
"brother, Prince "
Andrew Nikoláev
"ich, were not li"
"ving, it
would "
have been at onc
e announced in t
"he Gazette, as h"
e is a colonel.�
��  The prince
ss looked at him
", not grasping w"
hat he was sayin
"g, but cheered
"
by the expressio
n of regretful s
ympathy on his f
ace.  “And I
 have known so m
any cases of a s
plinter wound”
 (the Gazette sa
id it was a she
ll) “either pr
oving fatal at o
nce or being ver
"y slight,”
co"
ntinued Nicholas
. “We must hop
"e for the best, "
and I am sure...
”  Princess 
Mary interrupted
" him.

“Oh, "
that would be so
 dread...” she
" began and, prev"
ented by agitati
on from finishi
"ng, she bent her"
 head with a mov
ement as gracefu
l as everything
 she did in his 
"presence and, lo"
oking up at him 
"gratefully,
wen"
"t out, following"
 her aunt.  Th
at evening Nicho
las did not go o
"ut, but stayed a"
t home to settle
 some accounts 
with the horse d
ealers. When he 
had finished tha
t business it w
as already too l
ate to go anywhe
re but still too
 early to go to 
"bed,
and for a "
long time he pac
ed up and down t
"he room, reflect"
ing on his life
", a thing he rar"
ely did.  Prin
cess Mary had ma
de an agreeable 
impression on hi
m when he had me
t her in Smolé
nsk province. Hi
s having encount
ered her in such
 exceptional ci
"rcumstances, and"
 his mother havi
ng at one time m
entioned her to 
him as a good m
"atch, had drawn "
his particular a
ttention to her.
 When he met her
 again in Voró
nezh the impress
ion she made on 
him was not mere
ly pleasing but
 powerful. Nicho
las had been str
uck by the pecul
iar moral beauty
 he observed in
 her at this tim
"e. He was, howev"
"er, preparing to"
 go away and it
 had not entered
 his head to reg
ret that he was 
thus depriving h
imself of chanc
es of meeting he
r. But that day�
��s encounter in
" church had, he"
"
felt, sunk deep"
er than was desi
rable for his pe
ace of mind. Tha
"t pale,
sad, re"
"fined face, that"
" radiant look, t"
hose gentle grac
"eful gestures,
"
and especially t
he deep and tend
er sorrow expres
sed in all her f
eatures agitate
d him and evoked
 his sympathy. I
n men Rostóv co
uld not bear to 
 see the express
ion of a higher 
spiritual life (
that was why he 
did not like Pr
ince Andrew) and
 he referred to 
it contemptuousl
y as philosophy 
"
and dreaminess,"
 but in Princess
 Mary that very 
sorrow which rev
ealed the depth
 of a whole spir
itual world fore
ign to him was a
n irresistible 
attraction.  �
��She must be a 
wonderful woman.
 A real angel!�
� he said to him
self. “Why am
 I not free? Why
 was I in such a
 hurry with Són
ya?” And he i
nvoluntarily com
pared the two: t
he lack of spiri
tuality in the o
ne and the abun
dance of it in t
he other—a spi
rituality he him
self lacked and 
 therefore value
d most highly. H
e tried to pictu
re what would ha
ppen were he fr
ee. How he would
 propose to her 
and how she woul
d become his wif
"e.
But no, he c"
ould not imagine
 that. He felt a
"wed, and no clea"
r picture prese
nted itself to h
is mind. He had 
long ago picture
d to himself a 
future with Són
"ya, and that was"
 all clear and s
imple just becau
se it had all b
een thought out 
and he knew all 
there was in Só
"nya, but it was"
 impossible to p
icture a future 
with Princess Ma
"ry, because he d"
id not understa
nd her but simpl
y loved her.  
Reveries about S
ónya had had so
mething merry an
d playful in the
"m, but to
dream"
 of Princess Mar
y was always dif
ficult and a lit
tle frightening.
  “How she p
rayed!” he tho
ught. “It was 
plain that her w
hole soul was in
 her prayer. Ye
"s, that was the "
prayer that move
"s mountains, and"
 I am sure her 
prayer will be a
nswered. Why don
’t I pray for 
what I want?” 
he suddenly tho
ught. “What do
 I want? To be f
"ree, released fr"
om Sónya... Sh
"e was right,” "
"he thought, reme"
mbering what the
 governor’s wi
fe had said: �
�Nothing but mis
fortune can come
 of marrying Só
"nya. Muddles,
g"
rief for Mamma..
. business diffi
culties... muddl
"es, terrible mud"
"dles!
Besides, "
I don’t love h
er—not as I sh
"ould. O, God! re"
lease me from t
"his dreadful, in"
extricable posit
ion!” he sudde
nly began to pra
"y. “Yes,
pray"
er can move moun
"tains, but one m"
ust have faith a
nd not pray as 
Natásha and I u
sed to as childr
"en, that the sno"
w might turn int
o sugar—and t
hen run out into
 the yard to see
 whether it had 
"done so. No,
bu"
t I am not prayi
ng for trifles n
"ow,” he though"
t as he put his 
pipe down in a 
"corner, and fold"
ing his hands pl
aced himself bef
ore the icon. S
oftened by memor
ies of Princess 
Mary he began to
 pray as he had 
not done for a 
long time. Tears
 were in his eye
s and in his thr
oat when the do
or opened and La
vrúshka came in
 with some paper
s.  “Blockhe
ad! Why do you c
ome in without b
eing called?” 
"cried Nicholas,"
 quickly changin
g his attitude. 
  “From the g
"overnor,” said"
 Lavrúshka in a
 sleepy voice. �
��A courier has 
 arrived and the
re’s a letter 
for you.”  �
"��Well, all righ"
"t, thanks. You c"
an go!”  Nic
holas took the t
"wo letters, one "
of which was fro
m his mother and
 the other from
 Sónya. He reco
gnized them by t
he handwriting a
nd opened Sóny
a’s first. He 
had read only a 
few lines when h
e turned pale an
d his eyes open
ed wide with fea
r and joy.  �
"�No, it’s not "
possible!” he 
cried aloud.  
Unable to sit st
ill he paced up 
and down the roo
m holding the le
tter and readin
g it. He glanced
" through it, the"
"n read it again,"
" and then again,"
 and standing s
till in the midd
le of the room h
e raised his sho
"ulders,
stretch"
ing out his hand
"s, with his mout"
h wide open and 
his eyes fixed. 
 What he had jus
t been praying f
or with confiden
ce that God woul
d hear him had 
come to pass; bu
t Nicholas was a
s much astonishe
d as if it were 
 something extra
ordinary and une
"xpected, and as "
if the very fact
 that it had ha
ppened so quickl
y proved that it
 had not come fr
om God to whom h
"e
had prayed, b"
ut by some ordin
ary coincidence.
  This unexpec
"ted and, as it s"
eemed to Nichola
"s, quite volunta"
ry letter from 
Sónya freed him
 from the knot t
hat fettered him
 and from which 
 there had seeme
d no escape. She
 wrote that the 
last unfortunate
 events—the l
oss of almost th
e whole of the R
ostóvs’ Mosco
w property—and
 the countess�
� repeatedly exp
ressed wish that
 Nicholas should
 marry Princess
" Bolkónskaya, t"
ogether with his
 silence and col
"dness of late,
"
had all combined
 to make her dec
ide to release h
im from his prom
ise and set him
 completely free
.  It would be
 too painful to 
me to think that
 I might be a ca
use of sorrow o
r discord in the
 family that has
 been so good to
" me (she wrote),"
 and my love ha
s no aim but the
 happiness of th
"ose I love; so, "
"Nicholas, I
beg"
 you to consider
" yourself free, "
and to be assure
"d that, in spite"
" of
everything,"
 no one can love
 you more than d
oes  Your Són
ya  Both lette
rs were written 
from Tróitsa. T
"he other, from t"
"he countess,
de"
scribed their la
st days in Mosco
"w, their departu"
"re, the fire, an"
d the destructi
on of all their 
property. In thi
s letter the cou
ntess also ment
ioned that Princ
e Andrew was amo
ng the wounded t
raveling with th
em; his state w
as very critical
", but the doctor"
 said there was 
now more hope. 
Sónya and Natá
sha were nursing
 him.  Next da
y Nicholas took 
his mother’s l
etter and went t
o see Princess 
Mary. Neither he
 nor she said a 
word about what 
“Natásha nurs
ing him” migh
"t mean, but than"
ks to this lette
r Nicholas sudde
nly became almos
t as intimate w
ith the princess
 as if they were
 relations.  T
he following day
 he saw Princess
 Mary off on her
 journey to Yaro
"slávl,
and a f"
ew days later le
ft to rejoin his
 regiment.   
   CHAPTER VI
II  Sónya’s
 letter written 
"from Tróitsa, w"
hich had come as
 an answer to N
icholas’ praye
"r, was prompted "
by this: the tho
ught of getting 
Nicholas marrie
d to an heiress 
occupied the old
 countess’ min
d more and more.
 She knew that 
Sónya was the c
hief obstacle to
" this happening,"
 and Sónya’s 
 life in the cou
ntess’ house h
ad grown harder 
"and harder, espe"
cially after th
ey had received 
a letter from Ni
cholas telling o
f his meeting w
ith Princess Mar
y in Boguchárov
o. The countess 
let no occasion 
slip of making 
humiliating or c
ruel allusions t
o Sónya.  But
 a few days befo
re they left Mos
"cow, moved and e"
xcited by all th
at was going on
", she called Só"
"nya to her and, "
instead of repro
aching and maki
ng demands on he
"r, tearfully imp"
lored her to sac
rifice herself 
and repay all th
at the family ha
d done for her b
y breaking off h
er engagement w
ith Nicholas.  
 “I shall not 
be at peace till
 you promise me 
this.”  Són
ya burst into hy
sterical tears a
nd replied throu
gh her sobs that
 she would do a
nything and was 
prepared for any
"thing, but gave "
no actual promi
se and could not
 bring herself t
o decide to do w
hat was demanded
 of her. She mu
st sacrifice her
self for the fam
ily that had rea
red and brought
 her up. To sacr
ifice herself fo
r others was Só
nya’s habit. H
er position in 
the house was su
ch that only by 
sacrifice could 
she show her wo
"rth, and she was"
 accustomed to t
his and loved do
ing it. But in a
ll her former a
cts of self-sacr
ifice she had be
en happily consc
ious that they 
raised her in he
r own esteem and
 in that of othe
"rs, and so made "
her more worthy
 of Nicholas who
m she loved more
 than anything i
n the world. But
 now they wante
d her to sacrifi
ce the very thin
g that constitut
ed the whole re
ward for her sel
f-sacrifice and 
the whole meanin
g of her life. 
And for the firs
t time she felt 
bitterness again
st those who had
 been her benef
actors only to t
orture her the m
ore painfully; s
he felt jealous 
 of Natásha who
 had never exper
ienced anything 
"of this sort, ha"
d never needed 
to sacrifice her
"self, but made o"
thers sacrifice 
themselves for 
her and yet was 
beloved by every
body. And for th
e first time Só
nya felt that o
"ut of her pure, "
quiet love for N
icholas a passio
nate feeling wa
s beginning to g
row up which was
 stronger than p
"rinciple, virtue"
",
or religion. "
Under the influe
nce of this feel
"ing Sónya, whos"
e life of depen
dence had taught
 her involuntari
ly to be secreti
"ve, having answe"
red the countes
s in vague gener
"al terms, avoide"
d talking with h
er and resolved
 to wait till sh
e should see Nic
"holas, not in or"
der to set him 
free but on the 
contrary at that
 meeting to bind
 him to her fore
ver.  The bust
le and terror of
 the Rostóvs’
 last days in Mo
scow stifled the
 gloomy thought
s that oppressed
 Sónya. She was
 glad to find es
cape from them 
in practical act
ivity. But when 
she heard of Pri
nce Andrew’s 
presence in thei
"r house, despite"
 her sincere pit
y for him and fo
"r
Natásha, she"
 was seized by a
 joyful and supe
rstitious feelin
g that God did 
not intend her t
o be separated f
rom Nicholas. Sh
e knew that Nat�
�sha loved no o
ne but Prince An
drew and had nev
er ceased to lov
e him. She knew
 that being thro
wn together agai
n under such ter
rible circumstan
ces they would 
again fall in lo
ve with one anot
"her, and that Ni"
cholas would th
en not be able t
o marry Princess
 Mary as they wo
uld be within th
e prohibited de
grees of affinit
y. Despite all t
he terror of wha
t had happened 
during those las
t days and durin
g the first days
 of their journ
"ey, this feeling"
 that Providence
 was intervening
 in her personal
 affairs cheere
d Sónya.  At 
the Tróitsa mon
astery the Rost�
�vs first broke 
their journey fo
r a whole day. 
  Three large r
ooms were assign
ed to them in th
e monastery host
"elry, one
of wh"
ich was occupied
 by Prince Andre
w. The wounded m
an was much bett
er that day and
 Natásha was si
tting with him. 
In the next room
 sat the count 
and countess res
pectfully conver
sing with the pr
"ior, who was
ca"
lling on them as
 old acquaintanc
es and benefacto
rs of the monast
ery. Sónya was
" there too, torm"
ented by curiosi
ty as to what Pr
ince Andrew and 
 Natásha were t
alking about. Sh
e heard the soun
d of their voice
s through the d
oor. That door o
pened and Natás
"ha came out, loo"
king excited. No
t noticing the 
"monk, who had ri"
sen to greet her
 and was drawing
 back the wide 
sleeve on his ri
"ght arm, she wen"
t up to Sónya a
nd took her hand
.  “Natásha
", what are you a"
bout? Come here!
” said the cou
ntess.  Natás
ha went up to th
e monk for his b
"lessing, and he "
advised her to p
ray for aid to 
God and His sain
t.  As soon as
 the prior withd
"rew, Natásha to"
ok her friend by
 the hand and w
ent with her int
o the unoccupied
 room.  “Só
"nya, will he liv"
e?” she asked.
" “Sónya, how "
"happy I am, and "
how unhappy!...
" Sónya, dovey, "
everything is as
 it used to be. 
If only he live
s! He cannot... 
because... becau
se... of...” a
nd Natásha burs
t into tears. 
 “Yes! I knew
 it! Thank God!�
�� murmured Són
ya. “He will l
ive.”  Sóny
a was not less a
gitated than her
 friend by the l
atter’s fear a
nd grief and by
 her own persona
l feelings which
 she shared with
 no one. Sobbin
"g, she kissed an"
d comforted Nat�
�sha. “If only
 he lives!” sh
e thought. Havi
"ng wept, talked,"
 and wiped away 
"their tears, the"
 two friends we
nt together to P
rince Andrew’s
 door. Natásha 
opened it cauti
ously and glance
"d into the room,"
 Sónya standing
 beside her at t
he half-open do
or.  Prince An
drew was lying r
aised high on th
ree pillows. His
 pale face was 
"calm, his eyes c"
"losed, and they "
could see his re
gular breathing.
"

“O, Natás"
ha!” Sónya su
ddenly almost sc
"reamed, catching"
 her companion�
�s arm and step
ping back from t
he door.  “W
hat? What is it?
” asked Natás
ha.  “It’s
" that, that...�"
"� said Sónya, w"
ith a white face
 and trembling l
ips.  Natásha
 softly closed t
he door and went
 with Sónya to 
"the window, not"
 yet understandi
ng what the latt
er was telling h
er.  “You re
"member,” said "
Sónya with a so
lemn and frighte
ned expression. 
 “You remember
 when I looked i
n the mirror for
 you... at Otrá
dnoe at Christm
as? Do you remem
ber what I saw?�
"��

“Yes, ye"
s!” cried Nat�
�sha opening her
" eyes wide, and "
vaguely recallin
g that Sónya h
ad told her some
thing about Prin
ce Andrew whom s
he had seen lyi
ng down.  “Y
ou remember?” 
Sónya went on. 
“I saw it then
 and told everyb
"ody, you
and Du"
nyásha. I saw h
im lying on a be
"d,” said she, "
making a gesture
 with her hand 
and a lifted fin
ger at each deta
"il, “and that "
he had his eyes 
 closed and was 
covered just wit
"h a pink quilt, "
and that his han
"ds were
folded,"
” she conclude
"d, convincing he"
rself that the d
etails she had j
ust seen were e
xactly what she 
had seen in the 
mirror.  She h
ad in fact seen 
nothing then but
 had mentioned t
he first thing t
hat came into h
"er head, but wha"
t she had invent
ed then seemed t
o her now as re
al as any other 
recollection. Sh
e not only remem
bered what she h
ad then said—
that he turned t
o look at her an
d smiled and was
 covered with s
omething red—b
ut was firmly co
nvinced that she
 had then seen a
nd said that he
 was covered wit
h a pink quilt a
nd that his eyes
 were closed.  
"
“Yes, yes, it"
 really was pink
!” cried Natá
"sha, who now tho"
ught she too re
membered the wor
d pink being use
"d, and saw in th"
is the most ext
raordinary and m
ysterious part o
f the prediction
.  “But what
 does it mean?�
� she added medi
tatively.  “
"Oh, I don’t kn"
"ow, it is all so"
" strange,” rep"
"lied Sónya, clu"
tching at her h
ead.  A few mi
nutes later Prin
ce Andrew rang a
nd Natásha went
" to him, but
S�"
"�nya, feeling un"
usually excited 
"and touched, rem"
ained at the win
dow thinking ab
out the strangen
ess of what had 
occurred.   T
hey had an oppor
tunity that day 
to send letters 
"to the army, and"
 the countess w
as writing to he
r son.  “Só
nya!” said the
" countess, raisi"
ng her eyes from
 her letter as h
er niece passed
", “Sónya, won"
’t you write t
o Nicholas?” S
he spoke in a so
"ft,
tremulous v"
"oice, and in the"
 weary eyes that
 looked over her
 spectacles Só
nya read all tha
t the countess m
eant to convey w
ith these words.
 Those eyes exp
"ressed entreaty,"
 shame at having
" to ask, fear of"
" a refusal, and"
 readiness for r
elentless hatred
 in case of such
 refusal.  Só
nya went up to t
"he countess and,"
" kneeling down, "
kissed her hand.
"

“Yes, Mamm"
"a, I will write,"
” said she.  
 Sónya was soft
"ened, excited, a"
nd touched by al
l that had occur
"red that
day, e"
specially by the
 mysterious fulf
illment she had 
just seen of her
 vision. Now th
at she knew that
 the renewal of 
Natásha’s rel
ations with Pri
nce Andrew would
 prevent Nichola
s from marrying 
"Princess Mary, s"
he was joyfully
 conscious of a 
return of that s
elf-sacrificing 
spirit in which
 she was accusto
med to live and 
loved to live. S
o with a joyful 
 consciousness o
f performing a m
agnanimous deed�

    CHAPTER I
X  The officer
 and soldiers wh
o had arrested P
ierre treated hi
m with hostilit
y but yet with r
"espect, in the g"
uardhouse to whi
ch he was taken.
 In their attit
ude toward him c
ould still be fe
lt both uncertai
nty as to who h
e might be—per
haps a very impo
rtant person—a
nd hostility as 
a result of the
ir recent person
al conflict with
 him.  But whe
n the guard was 
relieved next mo
"rning, Pierre fe"
lt that for the 
 new guard—bot
h officers and m
en—he was not 
as interesting a
s he had been t
o his captors; a
nd in fact the g
uard of the seco
nd day did not 
recognize in thi
"s big, stout man"
 in a peasant co
at the vigorous 
person who had 
fought so desper
ately with the m
arauder and the 
convoy and had 
uttered those so
lemn words about
 saving a child;
 they saw in him
 only No. 17 of
 the captured Ru
"ssians, arrested"
 and detained fo
r some reason b
y order of the H
igher Command. I
f they noticed a
nything remarkab
le about Pierre
", it was only hi"
"s unabashed, med"
itative concentr
ation and thoug
"htfulness, and t"
he way he spoke 
"French, which st"
ruck them as su
rprisingly good.
 In spite of thi
s he was placed 
that day with th
e other arreste
"d suspects, as t"
he separate room
 he had occupied
 was required b
y an officer.  
 All the Russian
s confined with 
Pierre were men 
of the lowest cl
"ass and,
recogn"
izing him as a g
"entleman, they a"
"ll avoided him, "
more especially 
as he spoke Fre
nch. Pierre felt
 sad at hearing 
them making fun 
of him.  That 
evening he learn
ed that all thes
"e prisoners (he,"
" probably, among"
 them) were to 
be tried for inc
endiarism. On th
e third day he w
as taken with t
he others to a h
ouse where a Fre
nch general with
 a white mustach
e sat with two 
colonels and oth
er Frenchmen wit
h scarves on the
ir arms. With t
he precision and
 definiteness cu
stomary in addre
"ssing prisoners,"
 and which is s
upposed to precl
ude human frailt
"y, Pierre like t"
he others was q
uestioned as to 
"who he was, wher"
"e he had been, w"
"ith what object,"
 and so on.  
"These questions,"
 like questions 
put at trials ge
"nerally, left th"
e essence of th
"e matter aside, "
shut out the pos
sibility of that
 essence’s be
"ing revealed, an"
d were designed 
only to form a c
hannel through w
hich the judges
 wished the answ
ers of the accus
ed to flow so as
 to lead to the
" desired result,"
 namely a convic
tion. As soon as
 Pierre began to
 say anything t
hat did not fit 
in with that aim
", the channel wa"
s removed and t
he water could f
low to waste. Pi
"erre felt, moreo"
"ver, what the ac"
cused always fe
el at their tria
"l, perplexity as"
 to why these qu
estions were pu
t to him. He had
 a feeling that 
it was only out 
of condescension
 or a kind of c
ivility that thi
s device of plac
ing a channel wa
s employed. He 
knew he was in t
hese men’s pow
"er, that only by"
 force had they 
brought him the
"re, that force a"
lone gave them t
he right to dema
nd answers to t
"heir questions, "
and that the sol
e object of that
 assembly was to
 inculpate him.
" And so, as they"
 had the power a
nd wish to incul
"pate
him, this "
expedient of an 
inquiry and tria
l seemed unneces
sary. It was ev
ident that any a
nswer would lead
 to conviction. 
When asked what 
he was doing wh
en he was arrest
"ed, Pierre repli"
ed in a rather t
ragic manner th
at he was restor
ing to its paren
ts a child he ha
d saved from the
 flames. Why ha
d he fought the 
marauder? Pierre
 answered that h
e “was protec
"ting a woman,”"
 and that “to 
protect a woman 
who was being in
sulted was the 
duty of every ma
n; that...” Th
ey interrupted h
"im, for this
wa"
s not to the poi
nt. Why was he i
n the yard of a 
burning house wh
ere witnesses h
ad seen him? He 
replied that he 
had gone out to 
see what was ha
ppening in Mosco
w. Again they in
terrupted him: t
hey had not aske
d where he was 
"going, but why h"
e was found near
 the fire? Who w
as he? they ask
"ed, repeating th"
eir first questi
"on, which he had"
 declined to ans
wer. Again he r
eplied that he c
ould not answer 
it.  “Put th
"at down, that’"
s bad... very ba
"d,” sternly re"
marked the gener
al with the whi
te mustache and 
red flushed face
.   On the fo
urth day fires b
roke out on the 
Zúbovski rampar
t.  Pierre and
 thirteen others
 were moved to t
he coach house o
f a merchant’s
 house near the
 Crimean bridge.
 On his way thro
ugh the streets 
Pierre felt sti
fled by the smok
e which seemed t
o hang over the 
whole city. Fir
es were visible 
on all sides. He
 did not then re
alize the signi
ficance of the b
urning of Moscow
", and looked at "
the fires with 
horror.  He pa
ssed four days i
n the coach hous
e near the Crime
an bridge and d
uring that time 
"learned, from th"
e talk of the Fr
"ench soldiers, t"
hat all those c
onfined there we
re awaiting a de
cision which mig
ht come any day 
 from the marsha
l. What marshal 
"this was, Pierre"
 could not learn
 from the soldi
ers. Evidently f
or them “the m
arshal” repres
ented a very hig
h and rather my
sterious power. 
  These first d
"ays, before the "
eighth of Septem
ber when the pri
soners were had
 up for a second
" examination, we"
re the hardest o
f all for Pierre
.      CHA
PTER X  On the
 eighth of Septe
mber an officer�
��a very importa
nt one judging b
y the respect t
he guards showed
 him—entered t
he coach house w
here the prison
ers were. This o
"fficer, probably"
 someone on the 
"staff, was holdi"
ng a paper in h
"is hand, and cal"
led over all the
" Russians there,"
 naming Pierre 
as “the man wh
o does not give 
his name.” Gla
ncing indolently
 and indifferen
tly at all the p
"risoners, he ord"
ered the officer
 in charge to h
ave them decentl
y dressed and ti
died up before t
aking them to th
e marshal. An h
our later a squa
d of soldiers ar
rived and Pierre
 with thirteen 
others was led t
o the Virgin’s
 Field. It was a
" fine day, sunny"
"
after rain, an"
d the air was un
usually pure. Th
e smoke did not 
hang low as on 
the day when Pie
rre had been tak
en from the guar
dhouse on the Z
úbovski rampart
", but rose throu"
gh the pure air 
in columns. No f
lames were seen
", but columns of"
 smoke rose on a
"ll sides, and al"
l Moscow as far 
 as Pierre could
 see was one vas
t charred ruin. 
On all sides the
re were waste s
paces with only 
stoves and chimn
ey stacks still 
"standing, and
h"
ere and there th
e blackened wall
s of some brick 
houses. Pierre g
azed at the rui
ns and did not r
ecognize distric
ts he had known 
well. Here and 
there he could s
ee churches that
 had not been bu
rned. The Kréml
"in, which
was n"
"ot destroyed, gl"
eamed white in t
he distance with
 its towers and 
 the belfry of I
ván the Great. 
The domes of the
 New Convent of 
the Virgin glit
tered brightly a
nd its bells wer
e ringing partic
ularly clearly. 
 These bells rem
inded Pierre tha
t it was Sunday 
and the feast of
 the Nativity o
f the Virgin. Bu
t there seemed t
o be no one to c
elebrate this h
oliday: everywhe
re were blackene
"d ruins, and the"
 few Russians to
 be seen were t
attered and frig
htened people wh
o tried to hide 
when they saw t
he French.  It
 was plain that 
the Russian nest
 was ruined and 
"destroyed, but i"
n place of the 
Russian order of
 life that had b
"een destroyed, P"
ierre unconscio
usly felt that a
 quite different
", firm, French o"
rder had been e
stablished over 
this ruined nest
. He felt this i
n the looks of 
the soldiers who
", marching in re"
gular ranks bris
"kly and gaily, w"
ere escorting h
im and the other
 criminals; he f
elt it in the lo
oks of an impor
tant French offi
cial in a carria
ge and pair driv
"en by a soldier,"
 whom they met 
on the way. He f
elt it in the me
rry sounds of re
gimental music 
he heard from th
e left side of t
"he field, and fe"
lt and realized 
 it especially f
rom the list of 
prisoners the Fr
ench officer had
 read out when 
he came that mor
ning. Pierre had
 been taken by o
ne set of soldie
rs and led firs
t to one and the
n to another pla
ce with dozens o
"f other men,
an"
d it seemed that
 they might have
" forgotten him, "
or confused him 
with the others
. But no: the an
swers he had giv
en when question
ed had come bac
k to him in his 
designation as �
��the man who do
es not give his 
"name,”
and un"
der that appella
"tion, which to P"
ierre seemed ter
"rible, they were"
 now leading hi
m somewhere with
 unhesitating as
surance on their
 faces that he 
and all the othe
r prisoners were
 exactly the one
s they wanted a
nd that they wer
e being taken to
 the proper plac
e. Pierre felt h
imself to be an
 insignificant c
hip fallen among
 the wheels of a
 machine whose 
action he did no
t understand but
 which was worki
ng well.  He a
nd the other pri
soners were take
n to the right s
ide of the Virgi
"n’s
Field, to"
 a large white h
ouse with an imm
ense garden not 
far from the co
nvent. This was 
Prince Shcherbá
"tov’s house, w"
here Pierre had 
often been in o
"ther days, and w"
"hich, as he lear"
ned from the tal
k of the soldie
"rs, was now occu"
pied by the mars
"hal, the Duke of"
 Eckmühl (Davou
t).  They were
 taken to the en
trance and led i
nto the house on
e by one. Pierr
e was the sixth 
to enter. He was
 conducted throu
gh a glass galle
"ry,
an anteroom"
", and a hall, wh"
ich were familia
"r to him, into a"
 long low study
 at the door of 
which stood an a
djutant.  Davo
"ut, spectacles o"
"n nose, sat bent"
 over a table at
 the further end
 of the room. P
ierre went close
" up to him, but "
"Davout, evidentl"
y consulting a 
paper that lay b
"efore him, did n"
ot look up. With
out raising his 
"eyes,
he said i"
n a low voice: 
 “Who are you
?”  Pierre w
as silent becaus
e he was incapab
le of uttering a
 word. To him D
avout was not me
rely a French ge
"neral, but a man"
 notorious for h
is cruelty. Loo
king at his cold
" face, as he sat"
 like a stern sc
hoolmaster who 
was prepared to 
wait awhile for 
"an answer, Pierr"
e felt that ever
y instant of de
lay might cost h
im his life; but
 he did not know
 what to say. H
e did not ventur
e to repeat what
 he had said at 
his first exami
"nation, yet to d"
isclose his rank
 and position wa
s dangerous and 
 embarrassing. S
o he was silent.
 But before he h
ad decided what 
"to do,
Davout r"
"aised his head, "
pushed his spect
acles back on hi
"s forehead,
scr"
ewed up his eyes
", and looked int"
ently at him.  
 “I know that 
"man,” he said "
"in a cold, measu"
"red tone, eviden"
tly calculated 
to frighten Pier
re.  The chill
 that had been r
unning down Pier
re’s back now 
seized his head 
 as in a vise. 
 “You cannot 
"know me, General"
", I have never s"
een you...”  
 “He is a Russ
"ian spy,” Davo"
"ut interrupted, "
addressing anoth
er general who 
"was present, but"
 whom Pierre had
 not noticed.  
 Davout turned a
way. With an une
xpected reverber
ation in his voi
ce Pierre rapid
ly began:  “
"No, monseigneur,"
"” he said, sud"
denly rememberin
g that Davout wa
s a duke. “No
", monseigneur, y"
ou cannot have k
nown me. I am a 
militia officer 
and have not qu
itted Moscow.”
  “Your name
?” asked Davou
t.  “Bezúkh
ov.”  “Wha
t proof have I t
hat you are not 
lying?”  “
Monseigneur!” 
exclaimed Pierre
", not in an offe"
nded but in a pl
eading voice. 
 Davout looked 
up and gazed int
ently at him. Fo
r some seconds t
hey looked at o
"ne another, and "
that look saved 
Pierre. Apart fr
om conditions of
" war
and law, t"
hat look establi
shed human relat
ions between the
 two men. At th
at moment an imm
ense number of t
hings passed dim
ly through both 
"their
minds, an"
d they realized 
that they were b
oth children of 
humanity and we
re brothers.  
At the first gla
"nce, when Davout"
 had only raised
 his head from t
he papers where
 human affairs a
nd lives were in
dicated by numbe
"rs, Pierre
was "
merely a circums
"tance, and Davou"
t could have sho
t him without b
urdening his con
science with an 
"evil deed, but n"
ow he saw in him
 a human being.
 He reflected fo
r a moment.  �
��How can you sh
ow me that you a
re telling the t
ruth?” said Da
vout coldly.  
 Pierre remember
"ed Ramballe, and"
 named him and h
is regiment and 
the street wher
e the house was.
  “You are n
"ot what you say,"
” returned Dav
out.  In a tre
"mbling, falterin"
g voice Pierre b
egan adducing pr
oofs of the tru
th of his statem
ents.  But at 
that moment an a
djutant entered 
and reported som
ething to Davout
.  Davout brig
htened up at the
 news the adjuta
"nt brought, and "
began buttoning
 up his uniform.
 It seemed that 
he had quite for
gotten Pierre. 
 When the adjut
ant reminded him
 of the prisoner
", he jerked his "
head in Pierre�
��s direction wi
th a frown and o
rdered him to be
 led away. But 
where they were 
to take him Pier
re did not know:
 back to the coa
ch house or to 
the place of exe
cution his compa
nions had pointe
d out to him as 
 they crossed th
e Virgin’s Fie
ld.  He turned
 his head and sa
w that the adjut
ant was putting 
another questio
n to Davout.  
"“Yes, of cours"
e!” replied Da
"vout, but what t"
his “yes” me
"ant, Pierre did"
 not know.  Pi
erre could not a
fterwards rememb
"er how he went, "
whether it was f
"ar, or
in which"
 direction. His 
faculties were q
"uite numbed, he "
"was stupefied,
"
and noticing not
hing around him 
went on moving h
is legs as the o
thers did till 
they all stopped
 and he stopped 
too. The only th
ought in his mi
nd at that time 
was: who was it 
that had really 
sentenced him to
 death? Not the
 men on the comm
ission that had 
first examined h
im—not one of
 them wished to 
"or, evidently, c"
ould have done i
t. It was not Da
"vout,
who had l"

so human a way. 
In another momen
t Davout would 
have realized th
at he was doing 
"wrong, but just "
then the adjutan

im. The adjutant
", also, had evid"
ently had no ev

 he might have r

o was executing
" him, killing hi"
"m, depriving him"
" of life—him, "
"Pierre, with all"
"
his memories, "
"aspirations, hop"
"es, and thoughts"
? Who was doing 
this? And Pierr
e felt that it w
as no one.  It
 was a system—
a concurrence of
 circumstances. 
  A system of s
ome sort was kil
ling him—Pierr
e—depriving hi

"verything, annih"
ilating him.  
    CHAPTER 
XI  From Princ
e Shcherbátov�
�s house the pri
soners were led 
straight down th
e Virgin’s Fi
"eld, to the left"
" of the nunnery,"
 as far as a kit
chen garden in 
which a post had
 been set up. Be
yond that post a
 fresh pit had b
een dug in the 
"ground, and near"
 the post and th
e pit a large cr
owd stood in a 
semicircle. The 
crowd consisted 
of a few Russian
s and many of N
apoleon’s sold
iers who were no
t on duty—Germ
"ans, Italians, a"
"nd
Frenchmen, i"
n a variety of u
niforms. To the 
right and left o
f the post stoo
d rows of French
 troops in blue 
uniforms with re
d epaulets and h
igh boots and s
hakos.  The pr
isoners were pla
ced in a certain
" order, accordin"
g to the list (
Pierre was sixth
"), and were led "
to the post. Sev
eral drums sudde
nly began to be
at on both sides
" of them, and at"
 that sound Pier
re felt as if p
art of his soul 
had been torn aw
ay. He lost the 
power of thinkin
g or understand
ing. He could on
ly hear and see.
 And he had only
 one wish—that
 the frightful 
thing that had t
o happen should 
happen quickly. 
Pierre looked r
ound at his fell
ow prisoners and
 scrutinized the
m.  The two fi
rst were convict
s with shaven he
ads. One was tal
"l and thin,
the"
" other dark, sha"
"ggy, and sinewy,"
 with a flat nos
e. The third was
 a domestic ser
"f, about forty-f"
"ive years old, w"
ith grizzled hai
"r and a
plump, "
well-nourished b
ody. The fourth 
"was a peasant, a"
 very handsome 
man with a broad
", light-brown be"
ard and black ey
es. The fifth wa
s a factory han
"d, a thin, sallo"
w-faced lad of e
ighteen in a loo
se coat.  Pier
re heard the Fre
nch consulting w
hether to shoot 
them separately 
or two at a tim
e. “In couples
",” replied the"
 officer in comm
and in a calm v
oice. There was 
a stir in the ra
nks of the soldi
ers and it was e
vident that the
y were all hurry
ing—not as men
 hurry to do som
ething they und
"erstand, but as "
people hurry to 
finish a necessa
ry but unpleasan
t and incompreh
ensible task.  
 A French offici
al wearing a sca
rf came up to th
e right of the r
ow of prisoners
 and read out th
e sentence in Ru
ssian and in Fre
nch.  Then two
 pairs of French
men approached t
he criminals and
 at the officer
’s command too
k the two convic
ts who stood fir
st in the row. T
he convicts sto
pped when they r
eached the post 
"and, while sacks"
 were being bro
"ught, looked dum"
bly around as a 
wounded beast lo
oks at an approa
ching huntsman.
 One crossed him
self continually
", the other scra"
tched his back 
and made a movem
ent of the lips 
resembling a smi
le. With hurried
 hands the sold
iers blindfolded
" them, drawing t"
he sacks over th
"eir heads, and
"
bound them to th
e post.  Twelv
e sharpshooters 
with muskets ste
pped out of the 
ranks with a fir
m regular tread
 and halted eigh
t paces from the
 post. Pierre tu
rned away to av
oid seeing what 
was going to hap
pen. Suddenly a 
"crackling, rolli"
ng noise was he
ard which seemed
 to him louder t
han the most ter
"rific
thunder, "
and he looked ro
und. There was s
"ome smoke, and t"
he Frenchmen we
re doing somethi
"ng near the pit,"
 with pale faces
 and trembling h
ands. Two more 
prisoners were l
ed up. In the sa
me way and with 
"similar looks,
"
these two glance
d vainly at the 
onlookers with o
nly a silent app
eal for protect
ion in their eye
"s, evidently una"
ble to understan
d or believe wh
at was going to 
happen to them. 
They could not b
elieve it becaus
e they alone kn
ew what their li
fe meant to them
", and so they ne"
ither understood
 nor believed t
hat it could be 
taken from them.
  Again Pierre
 did not wish to
 look and again 
turned away; but
 again the soun
d as of a fright
ful explosion st
"ruck his ear, an"
d at the same mo
ment he saw smo
"ke, blood, and t"
"he pale, scared "
faces of the Fre
nchmen who were
 again doing som
ething by the po
"st, their trembl"
ing hands impedi
ng one another.
" Pierre, breathi"
"ng heavily, look"
ed around as if 
asking what it 
meant. The same 
question was exp
ressed in all th
e looks that met
 his.  On the 
faces of all the
 Russians and of
 the French sold
iers and officer
s without excep
"tion, he read th"
"e same dismay, h"
"orror, and confl"
ict that were i
n his own heart.
" “But who, aft"
"er all, is doing"
 this? They are 
all suffering a
s I am. Who then
 is it? Who?” 
flashed for an i
nstant through 
his mind.  “
Sharpshooters of
" the 86th, forwa"
rd!” shouted s
omeone. The fift
"h
prisoner, the"
 one next to Pie
"rre, was led awa"
y—alone. Pierr
e did not under
stand that he wa
"s saved, that he"
 and the rest ha
d been brought 
there only to wi
tness the execut
ion. With ever-g
"rowing horror, a"
nd no sense of 
"joy or relief, h"
e gazed at what 
was taking place
. The fifth man 
 was the factory
 lad in the loos
e cloak. The mom
ent they laid ha
nds on him he s
prang aside in t
error and clutch
ed at Pierre. (P
ierre shuddered 
 and shook himse
lf free.) The la
d was unable to 
walk. They dragg
"ed him
along, h"
olding him up un
"der the arms, an"
d he screamed. W
hen they got hi
m to the post he
" grew quiet, as "
if he suddenly u
nderstood someth
ing. Whether he
 understood that
 screaming was u
seless or whethe
r he thought it
 incredible that
 men should kill
" him, at any rat"
e he took his st
and at the post
", waiting to be "
blindfolded like
" the others, and"
 like a wounded 
 animal looked a
round him with g
littering eyes. 
  Pierre was no
 longer able to 
turn away and cl
ose his eyes. Hi
s curiosity and
" agitation, like"
 that of the who
"le crowd, reache"
d the highest pi
tch at this fif
th murder. Like 
the others this 
fifth man seemed
 calm; he wrapp
ed his loose clo
ak closer and ru
bbed one bare fo
ot with the othe
r.  When they 
began to blindfo
ld him he himsel
f adjusted the k
not which hurt 
the back of his 
head; then when 
they propped him
 against the bl
"oodstained post,"
 he leaned back 
"and, not being c"
omfortable in th
"at
position, st"
raightened himse
"lf, adjusted his"
" feet, and leane"
d back again mo
re comfortably. 
Pierre did not t
ake his eyes fro
m him and did no
t miss his slig
htest movement. 
  Probably a wo
rd of command wa
s given and was 
followed by the 
reports of eigh
t muskets; but t
ry as he would P
ierre could not 
afterwards remem
ber having hear
d the slightest 
sound of the sho
ts. He only saw 
how the workman
 suddenly sank d
own on the cords
" that held him, "
how blood showed
 itself in two 
"places, how the "
ropes slackened 
under the weight
 of the hanging
" body, and how t"
he workman sat d
"own, his head ha"
nging unnaturall
y and one leg b
ent under him. P
ierre ran up to 
the post. No one
 hindered him. 
"Pale, frightened"
 people were doi
ng something aro
und the workman.
 The lower jaw 
of an old French
man with a thick
 mustache trembl
ed as he untied
 the ropes. The 
body collapsed. 
The soldiers dra
gged it awkwardl
y from the post
 and began pushi
ng it into the p
it.  They all 
plainly and cert
ainly knew that 
they were crimin
als who must hi
de the traces of
 their guilt as 
quickly as possi
ble.  Pierre g
lanced into the 
pit and saw that
 the factory lad
 was lying with 
 his knees close
 up to his head 
and one shoulder
 higher than the
 other. That sh
oulder rose and 
fell rhythmicall
y and convulsive
"ly, but spadeful"
s of earth were
 already being t
hrown over the w
hole body. One o
"f the
soldiers,"
 evidently suffe
"ring, shouted gr"
uffly and angril
y at Pierre to 
go back. But Pie
rre did not unde
rstand him and r
emained near the
" post,
and no o"
ne drove him awa
y.  When the p
it had been fill
ed up a command 
was given. Pierr
e was taken bac
"k to his place, "
and the rows of 
troops on both s
ides of the post
 made a half tu
rn and went past
 it at a measure
d pace. The twen
ty-four sharpsh
ooters with disc
"harged muskets, "
standing in the 
center of the c
"ircle, ran back "
to their places 
as the companies
 passed by.  P
ierre gazed now 
with dazed eyes 
at these sharpsh
ooters who ran i
n couples out o
f the circle. Al
l but one rejoin
ed their compani
"es. This
one, a"
" young soldier, "
his face deadly 
"pale, his shako "
"pushed back, and"
 his musket res
ting on the grou
"nd, still stood "
near the pit at 
the spot from w
hich he had fire
d. He swayed lik
"e a drunken man,"
 taking some ste
ps forward and 
back to save him
self from fallin
"g. An old, nonco"
mmissioned offi
cer ran out of t
he ranks and tak
ing him by the e
lbow dragged him
 to his company
. The crowd of R
ussians and Fren
chmen began to d
isperse. They a
ll went away sil
ently and with d
rooping heads. 
 “That will t
each them to sta
"rt fires,” sai"
d one of the Fre
nchmen.  Pierr
e glanced round 
at the speaker a
nd saw that it w
as a soldier who
 was trying to 
find some relief
 after what had 
"been done, but w"
as not able to 
do so. Without f
inishing what he
 had begun to sa
y he made a hop
eless movement w
ith his arm and 
went away.   
   CHAPTER XI
I  After the e
xecution Pierre 
was separated fr
om the rest of t
he prisoners an
d placed alone i
"n a small, ruine"
"d, and befouled "
church.  Towar
d evening a nonc
ommissioned offi
cer entered with
 two soldiers an
d told him that
 he had been par
doned and would 
now go to the ba
rracks for the 
prisoners of war
. Without unders
tanding what was
" said to him, Pi"
erre got up and
 went with the s
oldiers. They to
ok him to the up
per end of the 
"field, where the"
re were some she
ds built of char
"red planks, beam"
"s,
and battens,"
 and led him int
o one of them. I
n the darkness s
ome twenty diff
erent men surrou
nded Pierre. He 
looked at them w
ithout understan
ding who they w
"ere, why they we"
"re there, or wha"
t they wanted of
 him. He heard 
"what they said, "
but did not unde
rstand the meani
ng of the words 
and made no kin
d of deduction f
rom or applicati
on of them. He r
eplied to quest
ions they put to
" him, but did no"
t consider who w
as listening to 
"his
replies, no"
r how they would
 understand them
. He looked at t
heir faces and 
"figures, but the"
y all seemed to 
him equally mean
ingless.  From
 the moment Pier
re had witnessed
 those terrible 
murders committe
d by men who di
d not wish to co
"mmit them, it wa"
s as if the main
spring of his l
"ife, on which ev"
erything depende
d and which made
 everything appe
"ar
alive, had s"
uddenly been wre
nched out and ev
erything had col
lapsed into a h
eap of meaningle
ss rubbish. Thou
gh he did not ac
knowledge it to 
"
himself, his fa"
ith in the right
 ordering of the
" universe, in hu"
"manity,
in his "
"own soul, and in"
" God, had been d"
estroyed. He had
 experienced thi
"s
before, but n"
ever so strongly
 as now. When si
milar doubts had
 assailed him b
"efore, they had "
been the result 
of his own wrong
"doing, and at th"
e bottom of his
 heart he had fe
lt that relief f
rom his despair 
and from those 
doubts was to be
 found within hi
mself. But now h
e felt that the
 universe had cr
umbled before hi
s eyes and only 
meaningless ruin
"s
remained, and"
 this not by any
 fault of his ow
n. He felt that 
it was not in h
is power to rega
in faith in the 
meaning of life.
  Around him i
n the darkness m
en were standing
 and evidently s
omething about 
him interested t
hem greatly. The
y were telling h
im something and
 asking him som
ething. Then the
y led him away s
"omewhere, and at"
 last he found 
himself in a cor
ner of the shed 
among men who we
re laughing and 
 talking on all 
sides.  “Wel
"l, then, mates.."
. that very prin
ce who...” som
e voice at the o
ther end of the
 shed was saying
", with a strong "
emphasis on the 
word who.  Sit
ting silent and 
motionless on a 
heap of straw ag
"ainst the wall,"
 Pierre sometime
s opened and som
etimes closed hi
s eyes. But as s
oon as he close
d them he saw be
fore him the dre
adful face of th
e factory lad�
�especially drea
dful because of 
its simplicity�
�and the faces o
f the murderers
", even more drea"
dful because of 
their disquiet. 
And he opened h
is eyes again an
d stared vacantl
y into the darkn
ess around him. 
  Beside him in
 a stooping posi
tion sat a small
 man of whose pr
esence he was f
irst made aware 
by a strong smel
l of perspiratio
n which came fro
m him every tim
e he moved. This
 man was doing s
omething to his 
legs in the dar
"kness, and thoug"
h Pierre could n
ot see his face 
he felt that the
 man continuall
y glanced at him
. On growing use
d to the darknes
s Pierre saw th
at the man was t
aking off his le
"g bands, and the"
 way he did it a
roused Pierre�
�s interest.  
Having unwound t
he string that t
ied the band on 
"one leg, he care"
fully coiled it
 up and immediat
ely set to work 
on the other leg
", glancing up
a"
t Pierre. While 
one hand hung up
 the first strin
g the other was 
already unwindi
ng the band on t
he second leg. I
"n this way, havi"
ng carefully re
moved the leg ba
nds by deft circ
ular motions of 
his arm followin
g one another u
"ninterruptedly, "
the man hung the
 leg bands up on
 some pegs fixe
d above his head
. Then he took o
"ut a knife, cut "
"something, close"
"d
the knife, pl"
aced it under th
e head of his be
"d, and, seating "
himself comfort
"ably, clasped hi"
s arms round his
 lifted knees an
d fixed his eyes
 on Pierre. The
 latter was cons
cious of somethi
"ng pleasant, com"
"forting,
and we"
ll-rounded in th
ese deft movemen
"ts, in the man�"
�s well-ordered 
 arrangements in
" his corner, and"
 even in his ver
"y smell, and he "
looked at the m
an without takin
g his eyes from 
him.  “You�
�ve seen a lot o
"f trouble, sir, "
eh?” the littl
e man suddenly s
aid.  And ther
e was so much ki
ndliness and sim
plicity in his s
ingsong voice t
hat Pierre tried
" to reply, but h"
is jaw trembled 
and he felt tear
s rising to his
 eyes. The littl
"e fellow, giving"
 Pierre no time 
to betray his c
"onfusion, instan"
tly continued in
 the same pleasa
nt tones:  “
"Eh, lad, don’t"
 fret!” said h
"e, in the tender"
 singsong caress
ing voice old R
ussian peasant w
omen employ. “
"Don’t fret, fr"
iend—‘suffer
" an hour,
live "
for an age!’ t
hat’s how it i
"s, my dear fello"
w. And here we l
"ive,
thank heav"
"en, without offe"
nse. Among these
" folk, too, ther"
e are good men 
"as well as bad,�"
"�� said he, and "
"still speaking, "
he turned on his
 knees with a s
"upple movement, "
"got up, coughed,"
 and went off to
 another part of
 the shed.  �
"��Eh, you rascal"
!” Pierre hear
d the same kind 
voice saying at 
the other end o
f the shed. “S
"o you’ve come,"
 you rascal? She
 remembers... No
"w, now,
that’"
ll do!”  And
" the soldier, pu"
shing away a lit
tle dog that was
 jumping up at 
"him, returned to"
 his place and s
at down. In his 
hands he had som
ething wrapped 
in a rag.  “
"Here, eat a bit,"
" sir,” said he"
", resuming his f"
ormer respectful
 tone as he unw
rapped and offer
ed Pierre some b
aked potatoes. �
��We had soup fo
r dinner and th
e potatoes are g
rand!”  Pier
re had not eaten
 all day and the
 smell of the po
tatoes seemed e
xtremely pleasan
t to him. He tha
nked the soldier
 and began to ea
"t.

“Well, a"
re they all righ
t?” said the s
oldier with a sm
ile. “You shou
ld do like this
.”  He took 
"a potato, drew o"
ut his clasp kni
"fe, cut the pota"
to into two equ
al halves on the
 palm of his han
"d, sprinkled som"
e salt on it fro
"m the
rag, and "
handed it to Pie
rre.  “The p
otatoes are gran
d!” he said on
ce more. “Eat 
some like that!�
��  Pierre tho
ught he had neve
r eaten anything
 that tasted bet
"ter.

“Oh, I"
"’m all right,�"
"�� said he, “b"
ut why did they 
shoot those poor
 fellows? The l
ast one was hard
ly twenty.”  
"
“Tss, tt...!�"
�� said the litt
"le man. “Ah, w"
hat a sin... wha
t a sin!” he 
"added quickly, a"
nd as if his wor
ds were always w
aiting ready in 
his mouth and f
lew out involunt
arily he went on
": “How was it,"
" sir, that you
"
stayed in Moscow
?”  “I did
n’t think they
 would come so s
oon. I stayed ac
"cidentally,” r"
eplied Pierre. 
  “And how di
d they arrest yo
"u, dear lad? At "
your house?” 
"
“No, I went "
to look at the f
"ire, and they ar"
"rested me there,"
 and tried me a
s an incendiary.
”  “Where 
there’s law th
ere’s injustic
"e,” put in the"
 little man.  
“And have you 
been here long?�
�� Pierre asked 
as he munched th
e last of the p
otato.  “I? 
It was last Sund
"ay they took me,"
 out of a hospit
al in Moscow.”
"

“Why, are "
you a soldier th
en?”  “Yes
", we are soldier"
s of the Ápsher
on regiment. I w
as dying of feve
r. We weren’t
 told anything. 
There were some 
twenty of us lyi
ng there. We had
"
no idea, never"
 guessed at all.
”  “And do
 you feel sad he
re?” Pierre in
quired.  “Ho
w can one help i
"t, lad? My name "
"is Platón, and "
the surname is 
"Karatáev,” he"
" added, evidentl"
y wishing to mak
e it easier for 
Pierre to addre
ss him. “They 
call me ‘littl
e falcon’ in t
he regiment. How
 is one to help
 feeling sad? Mo
scow—she’s t
he mother of cit
ies. How can one
 see all this a
nd not feel sad?
 But ‘the magg
ot gnaws the cab
"bage, yet dies
"
first’; that�
�s what the old 
folks used to te
"ll us,” he add"
ed rapidly.  �
��What? What did
 you say?” ask
ed Pierre.  �
�Who? I?” said
 Karatáev. “I
 say things happ
en not as we pla
n but as God ju
"dges,” he repl"
"ied, thinking th"
at he was repeat
ing what he had 
"said
before, an"
d immediately co
ntinued:  “W
"ell, and you, ha"
ve you a family 
"estate, sir? And"
 a house? So you
 have abundance
", then? And a ho"
usewife? And you
"r old parents, a"
re they still l
iving?” he ask
ed.  And thoug
h it was too dar
k for Pierre to 
"see, he felt tha"
t a suppressed 
smile of kindlin
ess puckered the
 soldier’s lip
s as he put thes
e questions. He
 seemed grieved 
that Pierre had 
"no parents, espe"
cially that he 
had no mother. 
 “A wife for 
"counsel, a mothe"
r-in-law for wel
"come, but there�"
��s none as dea
r as one’s own
 mother!” said
" he. “Well, an"
d have you littl
e ones?” he w
ent on asking. 
 Again Pierre�
�s negative answ
er seemed to dis
"tress him, and h"
e hastened to a
dd:  “Never 
mind! You’re y
"oung folks yet, "
and please God m
ay still have so
me. The great t
hing is to live 
in harmony....�
�  “But it�
�s all the same 
"now,” Pierre c"
ould not help sa

“Ah, "
my dear fellow!�
�� rejoined Kara
"táev, “never "
decline a prison
 or a beggar’
s sack!”  He
 seated himself 
more comfortably
" and coughed, ev"
idently preparin
g to tell a lon
g story.  “W
"ell, my dear fel"
"low, I was still"
" living at home,"
” he began. �
�We had a well-
"to-do homestead,"
" plenty of land,"

 When Father and
 we went out mow
ing there were 
seven of us. We 
lived well. We w
ere real peasant
s. It so happen
ed...”  And 
Platón Karatáe
v told a long st
ory of how he ha
d gone into some
one’s copse t
"o take wood, how"
 he had been cau
ght by the keepe
"r, had been
tri"
"ed, flogged, and"
 sent to serve a
s a soldier.  
"“Well, lad,”"
 and a smile cha
nged the tone of
" his voice, “w"
e thought it wa

ut it turned out
 a blessing! If 
it had not been

 dear fellow. Fa

" always judging,"
 ‘that’s not

Our luck is like

 That’s how it
 is.”  And P
latón shifted h
is seat on the s
traw.  After a
 short silence h
e rose.  “We
"ll, I think you "
"must be sleepy,�"
"�� said he, and "
began rapidly cr
ossing himself 
and repeating: 
 “Lord Jesus 
"Christ, holy Sai"
"nt Nicholas, Fro"

rd Jesus Christ
", holy Saint Nic"
"holas, Frola and"
 Lavra! Lord Jes
"us Christ, have"

"concluded, then "
bowed to the gro

up, si"
"ghed, and sat do"
wn again on his 
heap of straw. �
��That’s the w
ay. Lay me down
" like a stone, O"
" God, and raise "
me up like a loa
"f,” he
mutter"
ed as he lay dow
"n, pulling his c"
oat over him.  
 “What prayer 
was that you wer
e saying?” ask
ed Pierre.  �
�Eh?” murmured
" Platón, who ha"
d almost fallen 
asleep. “What 
was I saying? I
 was praying. Do
n’t you pray?�
"��

“Yes, I "
"do,” said Pier"
re. “But what 
was that you sai
d: Frola and Lav
ra?”  “Wel
"l, of course,”"
 replied Platón
" quickly, “the"
 horses’ saint

curled up and go

ghter of a bitch

"�ev, touching th"
e dog that lay a
"t
his feet, and"
 again turning o
ver he fell asle
ep immediately. 
  Sounds of cry
ing and screamin
g came from some
where in the dis
"tance
outside, "
and flames were 
visible through 
the cracks of th
"e shed, but
ins"
ide it was quiet
 and dark. For a
 long time Pierr
"e did not sleep,"
 but lay with e
yes open in the 
"darkness, listen"
ing to the regul
ar snoring of P
latón who lay b
"eside him, and h"
e felt that the 
world that had b
een shattered w
as once more sti
rring in his sou
l with a new bea
uty and on new 
and unshakable f
oundations.   
    CHAPTER X
III  Twenty-th
"ree soldiers, th"
"ree officers, an"
d two officials 
were confined i
n the shed in wh
ich Pierre had b
een placed and w
here he remained
 for four weeks
.  When Pierre
 remembered them
 afterwards they
 all seemed mist
y figures to hi
m except Platón
" Karatáev, who "
always remained 
in his mind a mo
st vivid and pr
ecious memory an
d the personific
ation of everyth
"ing Russian,
ki"
"ndly, and round."
 When Pierre saw
 his neighbor ne
xt morning at da
wn the first im
"pression of him,"
 as of something
" round, was full"
y confirmed: Pl
atón’s whole 
figure—in a Fr
ench overcoat gi
rdled with a cor
"d, a
soldier’"
"s cap, and bast "
shoes—was roun
d. His head was 
"quite round, his"
"
back, chest, s"
"houlders, and ev"
"en his arms, whi"
ch he held as if
 ever ready to 
embrace somethin
"g, were rounded,"
 his pleasant sm
ile and his lar
"ge, gentle brown"
 eyes were also 
round.  Plató
n Karatáev must
 have been fifty
", judging by his"
 stories of cam
paigns he had be
"en in, told as b"
y an old soldier
. He did not him
self know his a
ge and was quite
 unable to deter
mine it. But his
 brilliantly wh
"ite, strong teet"
h which showed i
n two unbroken s
emicircles when 
he laughed—as
 he often did—
were all sound a
"nd good, there w"
as not a gray h
air in his beard
" or on his head,"
 and his whole b
ody gave an impr
ession of suppl
eness and especi
ally of firmness
 and endurance. 
"

His face, des"
"pite its fine, r"
"ounded wrinkles,"
 had an expressi
on of innocence
" and youth, his "
voice was pleasa
nt and musical. 
But the chief p
eculiarity of hi
s speech was its
 directness and 
appositeness. It
 was evident th
at he never cons
idered what he h
ad said or was g
"oing to say,
an"
d consequently t
he rapidity and 
justice of his i
ntonation had an
 irresistible p
ersuasiveness. 
 His physical s
trength and agil
ity during the f
irst days of his
 imprisonment w
ere such that he
 seemed not to k
now what fatigue
 and sickness m
eant. Every nigh
t before lying d
"own, he said: �"
"�Lord, lay me
d"
own as a stone a
nd raise me up a
s a loaf!” and
 every morning o
"n getting
up, h"
e said: “I lay
 down and curled
" up, I get up an"
d shake myself.�
�� And indeed h
e only had to li
"e down, to fall "
asleep like a st
"one, and he
onl"
y had to shake h
"imself, to be re"
ady without a mo
ment’s delay f
"or some
work, j"
ust as children 
are ready to pla
y directly they 
awake. He could 
"
do everything, "
not very well bu
t not badly. He 
"baked, cooked, s"
"ewed,
planed, a"
nd mended boots.
 He was always b
"usy, and only at"
 night allowed 
himself conversa
tion—of which 
he was fond—an
d songs. He did 
not sing like a
 trained singer 
who knows he is 
"listened to, but"
" like the birds,"
 evidently givi
ng vent to the s
ounds in the sam
e way that one s
tretches onesel
f or walks about
 to get rid of s
"tiffness, and th"
e sounds were a
lways high-pitch
"ed, mournful, de"
"licate, and almo"
"st feminine, and"
 his face at su
ch times was ver
y serious.  Ha
ving been taken 
prisoner and all
owed his beard t
"o grow, he seeme"
d to have throw
n off all that h
ad been forced u
pon him—everyt
hing military a
nd alien to hims
elf—and had re
turned to his fo
rmer peasant hab
its.  “A sol
dier on leave—
a shirt outside 
"breeches,” he "
would say.  He
 did not like ta
lking about his 
life as a soldie
"r, though he did"
" not
complain, "
and often mentio
ned that he had 
not been flogged
 once during th
e whole of his a
rmy service. Whe
n he related any
thing it was gen
erally some old
 and evidently p
recious memory o
f his “Christi
"an” life, as h"
e called his pe
asant existence.
" The proverbs, o"
f which his talk
" was full,
were"
 for the most pa
rt not the coars
e and indecent s
aws soldiers em
"ploy, but those "
folk sayings whi
ch taken without
 a context seem 
so insignifican
"t, but when used"
 appositely sudd
enly acquire a s
ignificance of 
profound wisdom.
  He would oft
en say the exact
 opposite of wha
t he had said on
 a previous occ
"asion, yet both "
would be right. 
He liked to talk
 and he talked w
"ell,
adorning h"
is speech with t
erms of endearme
nt and with folk
 sayings which 
Pierre thought h
e invented himse
"lf, but the chie"
f charm of his t
alk lay in the 
fact that the co
mmonest events�
�sometimes just 
such as Pierre 
had witnessed wi
thout taking not
ice of them—as
sumed in Karatá
ev’s a charac
ter of solemn fi
tness. He liked 
to hear the folk
 tales one of th
e soldiers used
 to tell of an e
vening (they wer
e always the sam
"e), but
most of"
 all he liked to
 hear stories of
 real life. He w
ould smile joyf
ully when listen
ing to such stor
"ies, now and the"
n putting in a w
ord or asking a
 question to mak
e the moral beau
ty of what he wa
s told clear to
 himself. Karat�
�ev had no attac
"hments, friendsh"
"ips, or love, as"
 Pierre underst
"ood them, but lo"
ved and lived af
fectionately wit
h everything lif
e brought him i
"n contact with, "
particularly wit
h man—not any 
"particular
man,"
 but those with 
whom he happened
 to be. He loved
" his dog, his
c"
"omrades, the Fre"
"nch, and Pierre "
who was his neig
"hbor, but Pierre"
 felt that in s
pite of Karatáe
v’s affectiona
te tenderness fo
r him (by which 
 he unconsciousl
y gave Pierre’
s spiritual life
 its due) he wou
ld not have gri
eved for a momen
t at parting fro
m him. And Pierr
e began to feel 
in the same way
 toward Karatáe
v.  To all the
 other prisoners
 Platón Karatá
ev seemed a most
 ordinary soldi
er. They called 
him “little fa
lcon” or “Pl
"atósha,” chaf"
fed him good-na
"turedly, and sen"
t him on errands
. But to Pierre 
he always remai
ned what he had 
seemed that firs
t night: an unfa
"thomable, rounde"
"d,
eternal pers"
onification of t
he spirit of sim
plicity and trut
h.  Platón Ka
ratáev knew not
hing by heart ex
cept his prayers
. When he began 
 to speak he see
med not to know 
how he would con
clude.  Someti
"mes Pierre, stru"
ck by the meanin
"g of his words, "
would ask him to
"
repeat them, b"
ut Platón could
 never recall wh
at he had said a
" moment
before,"
 just as he neve
r could repeat t
o Pierre the wor
ds of his favor
ite song: native
 and birch tree 
and my heart is 
sick occurred in
"
it, but when s"
poken and not su
"ng, no meaning c"
ould be got out 
of it. He did n
"ot, and could no"
"t, understand th"
e meaning of wor
ds apart from t
heir context. Ev
ery word and act
ion of his was t
he manifestation
 of an activity
" unknown to him,"
 which was his l
ife. But his lif
"e, as he
regard"
"ed it, had no me"
aning as a separ
ate thing. It ha
d meaning only a
s part of a who
le of which he w
as always consci
ous. His words a
nd actions flow
ed from him as e
"venly, inevitabl"
"y, and spontaneo"
usly as fragranc
e exhales from 
a flower. He cou
ld not understan
d the value or s
ignificance of 
any word or deed
 taken separatel
y.      CH
APTER XIV  Whe
n Princess Mary 
heard from Nicho
las that her bro
ther was with th
e Rostóvs at Y
aroslávl she at
 once prepared t
"o go there, in s"
pite of her aun
t’s efforts to
 dissuade her—
and not merely t
o go herself but
 to take her ne
phew with her. W
hether it were d
ifficult or easy
", possible or
i"
"mpossible, she d"
id not ask and d
id not want to k
now: it was her 
"duty,
not only "
"to herself, to b"
e near her broth
er who was perha
"ps dying, but
t"
o do everything 
possible to take
" his son to him,"
 and so she prep
ared to set off
. That she had n
ot heard from Pr
ince Andrew hims
"elf, Princess
M"
ary attributed t
o his being too 
weak to write or
 to his consider
ing the long jo
urney too hard a
nd too dangerous
 for her and his
 son.  In a fe
w days Princess 
Mary was ready t
o start. Her equ
ipages were the 
 huge family coa
ch in which she 
had traveled to 
"Vorónezh, a sem"
"iopen
trap, and"
 a baggage cart.
 With her travel
ed Mademoiselle 
"Bourienne,
litt"
le Nicholas and 
"his tutor, her o"
"ld nurse, three "
"maids, Tíkhon, "
and a young foo
tman and courier
 her aunt had se
nt to accompany 
her.  The usua
l route through 
Moscow could not
" be thought of, "
and the roundab
out way Princess
 Mary was oblige
d to take throug
"h Lípetsk,
Rya"
"zán, Vladímir,"
 and Shúya was 
"very long and, a"
s post horses we
re not everywhe
"re obtainable, v"
"ery difficult, a"
nd near Ryazán 
where the French
 were said to h
ave shown themse
lves was even da
ngerous.  Duri
ng this difficul
t journey Mademo
iselle Bourienne
", Dessalles, and"
 Princess Mary�
��s servants wer
e astonished at 
her energy and f
irmness of spir
it. She went to 
bed later and ro
se earlier than 
"any of them, and"
 no difficultie
s daunted her. T
hanks to her act
ivity and energy
", which
infecte"
d her fellow tra
"velers, they app"
roached Yaroslá
vl by the end of
 the second wee
k.  The last d
ays of her stay 
in Vorónezh had
 been the happie
st of her life. 
 Her love for Ro
stóv no longer 
tormented or agi
tated her. It fi
lled her whole 
"soul, had become"
 an integral par
"t of herself, an"
d she no longer 
 struggled again
st it. Latterly 
she had become c
onvinced that sh
e loved and was
" beloved, though"
 she never said 
this definitely 
to herself in w
ords. She had be
come convinced o
f it at her last
 interview with 
"
Nicholas, when "
he had come to t
ell her that her
 brother was wit
h the Rostóvs.
 Not by a single
 word had Nichol
as alluded to th
e fact that Pri
nce Andrew’s r
elations with Na
"tásha might, if"
" he recovered, b"
"e
renewed, but "
Princess Mary sa
w by his face th
at he knew and t
hought of this.
  Yet in spite
" of that, his re"
lation to her—
"considerate, del"
"icate, and
lovi"
ng—not only re
mained unchanged
", but it sometim"
es seemed to Pri
ncess Mary that
 he was even gla
d that the famil
y connection bet
ween them allow
ed him to expres
s his friendship
 more freely. Sh
e knew that she 
 loved for the f
irst and only ti
me in her life a
nd felt that she
" was
beloved, a"
nd was happy in 
regard to it.  
 But this happin
ess on one side 
of her spiritual
 nature did not 
prevent her fee
ling grief for h
er brother with 
full force; on t
"he contrary, tha"
t spiritual tra
nquility on the 
one side made it
 the more possib
le for her to g
ive full play to
 her feeling for
 her brother. Th
at feeling was s
o strong at the
 moment of leavi
ng Vorónezh tha
t those who saw 
"her off, as
the"
y looked at her 
"careworn, despai"
"ring face, felt "
sure she would f
all ill on the 
journey. But the
 very difficulti
es and preoccupa
tions of the jo
"urney, which she"
 took so activel
"y in hand, saved"
 her for a while
 from her grief
 and gave her st
rength.  As al
ways happens whe
"n traveling, Pri"
ncess Mary thoug
ht only of the 
"journey itself, "
forgetting its o
bject. But as sh
e approached Yar
oslávl the tho
ught of what mig
ht await her the
re—not after m
"any days, but th"
at very evening
—again present
ed itself to her
 and her agitati
on increased to
 its utmost limi
t.  The courie
r who had been s
ent on in advanc
e to find out wh
ere the Rostóv
s were staying i
"n Yaroslávl, an"
d in what condit
ion Prince Andre
"w
was, when he "
met the big coac
h just entering 
the town gates w
as appalled by 
the terrible pal
lor of the princ
ess’ face that
 looked out at h
im from the win
dow.  “I hav
e found out ever
"ything, your exc"
ellency: the Ros
tóvs are stayin
g at the mercha
nt Brónnikov’
"s house, in the "
Square not far f
"rom here,
right"
 above the Vólg
"a,” said the c"
ourier.  Princ
ess Mary looked 
at him with frig
"htened inquiry, "
not understandin
g why he did no
t reply to what 
she chiefly want
ed to know: how 
was her brother
? Mademoiselle B
ourienne put tha
t question for h
er.  “How is
 the prince?” 
she asked.  �
�His excellency 
is staying in th
e same house wit
h them.”  �
�Then he is aliv
"e,” thought Pr"
"incess Mary, and"
 asked in a low 
voice: “How i
s he?”  “T
he servants say 
he is still the 
same.”  What
 “still the sa
me” might mean
 Princess Mary d
"id not ask, but "
with an unnotic
ed glance at lit
tle seven-year-o
"ld Nicholas, who"
 was sitting in 
 front of her lo
oking with pleas
"ure at the town,"
 she bowed her h
ead and did not
 raise it again 
till the heavy c
"oach, rumbling, "
shaking and swa
"ying, came to a "
stop. The carria
ge steps clatter
ed as they were 
let down.  Th
e carriage door 
was opened. On t
he left there wa
s water—a grea
t river—and o
n the right a po
rch. There were 
people at the en
trance: servant
"s, and a rosy gi"
rl with a large 
plait of black h
"air, smiling as"
 it seemed to Pr
incess Mary in a
n unpleasantly a
ffected way. (Th
is was Sónya.)
 Princess Mary r
an up the steps.
" “This way, th"
is way!” said 
"the
girl, with "
the same artific
"ial smile, and t"
he princess foun
d herself in th
e hall facing an
 elderly woman o
"f Oriental type,"
 who came rapidl
y to meet her w
ith a look of em
otion. This was 
the countess. Sh
e embraced Prin
cess Mary and ki
ssed her.  “
Mon enfant!” s
"he muttered, “"
je vous aime et 
vous connais dep
uis longtemps.�
�� *      * �
�My child! I lov
e you and have k
nown you a long 
time.”   De
spite her excite
"ment, Princess M"
ary realized tha
t this was the 
countess and tha
t it was necessa
ry to say someth
ing to her. Hard
ly knowing how 
"she did it, she "
contrived to utt
er a few polite 
phrases in Fren
ch in the same t
one as those tha
t had been addre
"ssed to her, and"
 asked: “How 
is he?”  “
The doctor says 
that he is not i
"n danger,” sai"
"d the countess, "
but as she spok
e she raised her
 eyes with a sig
"h, and her gestu"
re conveyed a c
ontradiction of 
her words.  �
�Where is he? Ca
n I see him—ca
n I?” asked th
e princess.  �
"��One moment, Pr"
"incess, one mome"
"nt, my dear! Is "
this his son?”
 said the count
"ess, turning to "
little Nicholas 
who was coming i
n with Dessalles
. “There will
 be room for eve
"rybody, this is "
"a big house. Oh,"
 what a lovely 
boy!”  The c
ountess took Pri
ncess Mary into 
the drawing room
", where Sónya w"
as talking to M
ademoiselle Bour
ienne. The count
ess caressed the
" boy, and
the o"
ld count came in
 and welcomed th
e princess. He h
ad changed very 
 much since Prin
cess Mary had la
st seen him. The
n he had been a 
"brisk,
cheerful"
", self-assured o"
ld man; now he s
"eemed a pitiful,"
 bewildered per
son. While talki
ng to Princess M
ary he continual
ly looked round 
as if asking ev
eryone whether h
e was doing the 
right thing. Aft
er the destruct
ion of Moscow an
d of his propert
"y, thrown out of"
 his accustomed 
 groove he seeme
d to have lost t
he sense of his 
own significance
 and to feel th
at there was no 
longer a place f
or him in life. 
  In spite of h
er one desire to
 see her brother
 as soon as poss
"ible, and
her v"
exation that at 
the moment when 
all she wanted w
as to see him th
ey should be tr
ying to entertai
n her and preten
ding to admire h
"er nephew,
the "
princess noticed
 all that was go
ing on around he
r and felt the 
necessity of sub
"mitting, for a t"
"ime, to this new"
 order of things
 which she had 
entered. She kne
w it to be neces
"sary, and though"
 it was hard for
 her she was no
t vexed with the
se people.  �
�This is my niec
"e,” said the c"
"ount, introducin"
g Sónya—“Yo
u don’t know 
"her, Princess?�"
�  Princess Ma
ry turned to Só
"nya and, trying "
to stifle the ho
stile feeling t
hat arose in her
 toward the girl
", she kissed her"
. But she felt 
oppressed by the
 fact that the m
ood of everyone 
around her was s
o far from what
 was in her own 
heart.  “Whe
re is he?” she
" asked again, ad"
dressing them al
l.  “He is d
ownstairs. Natá
"sha is with him,"
” answered Só
"nya, flushing. �"
��We have sent 
to ask. I think 
you must be tire
"d, Princess.”"
  Tears of vexa
tion showed them
selves in Prince
ss Mary’s eyes
. She turned aw
ay and was about
 to ask the coun
tess again how t
"o go to him, whe"
"n
light, impetu"
"ous, and seeming"
ly buoyant steps
 were heard at t
he door. The pr
incess looked ro
und and saw Nat�
"�sha coming in, "
almost running�
�that Natásha 
whom she had lik
ed so little at 
their meeting in
 Moscow long si
nce.  But hard
ly had the princ
ess looked at Na
tásha’s face 
before she reali
zed that here w
as a real comrad
"e in her grief, "
and consequently
 a friend. She 
"ran to meet her,"
" embraced her, a"
nd began to cry 
on her shoulder.
  As soon as N
"atásha, sitting"
 at the head of 
Prince Andrew’
"s bed, heard
of"
 Princess Mary�
"�s arrival, she "
softly left his 
room and hastene
d to her with t
hose swift steps
 that had sounde
d buoyant to Pri
ncess Mary.  T
here was only on
e expression on 
her agitated fac
e when she ran i
nto the drawing
 room—that of 
love—boundless
" love for him, f"
"or her, and for "
all that was ne
ar to the man sh
e loved; and of 
"pity, suffering "
"for others,
and"
 passionate desi
re to give herse
lf entirely to h
elping them. It 
was plain that 
at that moment t
here was in Nat�
�sha’s heart n

own relations wi

"ry, with her acu"
"te sensibility, "
understood all t
his at the firs
t glance at Nat�
"�sha’s face, a"
nd wept on her s
houlder with sor
rowful pleasure
".

“Come, co"
"me to him, Mary,"
” said Natásh
"a, leading her i"
nto the other r
oom.  Princess
 Mary raised her
" head, dried her"
" eyes, and turne"
d to Natásha. 
She felt that fr
om her she would
 be able to unde
rstand and learn
 everything.  
 “How...” sh
e began her ques
tion but stopped
 short.  She f
elt that it was 
impossible to as
"k, or to answer,"
 in words. Nat�
�sha’s face an
d eyes would hav
e to tell her al
l more clearly a
nd profoundly. 
  Natásha was 
"gazing at her, b"
ut seemed afraid
 and in doubt wh
ether to say al
l she knew or no
t; she seemed to
 feel that befor
e those luminous
 eyes which pen
etrated into the
 very depths of 
"her heart, it wa"
s impossible no
t to tell the wh
ole truth which 
she saw. And sud
"denly, Natásha�"
��s lips twitch
"ed, ugly wrinkle"
s gathered round
" her mouth, and "
covering her fac
e with her hand
s she burst into
 sobs.  Prince
ss Mary understo
od.  But she s
"till hoped, and "
"asked, in words "
she herself did 
not trust:  �
�But how is his 
wound? What is h
is general condi
tion?”  “Y
"ou, you... will "
"see,” was all "
Natásha could s
ay.  They sat 
a little while d
ownstairs near h
is room till the
y had left off 
crying and were 
able to go to hi
m with calm face
s.  “How has
 his whole illne
ss gone? Is it l
ong since he gre
w worse? When d
id this happen?�
�� Princess Mary
 inquired.  Na
tásha told her 
that at first th
ere had been dan
ger from his fev
erish condition
 and the pain he
" suffered, but a"
t Tróitsa that 
had passed and 
the doctor had o
nly been afraid 
of gangrene. Tha
t danger had als
o passed. When 
they reached Yar
oslávl the woun
d had begun to f
ester (Natásha
 knew all about 
such things as f
estering) and th
e doctor had sa
id that the fest
ering might take
 a normal course
. Then fever set
" in,
but the do"
ctor had said th
e fever was not 
very serious.  
 “But two days
 ago this sudden

"said Natásha, s"
truggling with 
her sobs. “I d
"on’t know why,"
 but you will se
e what he is lik
e.”  “Is h
e weaker? Thinne
r?” asked the 
princess.  “
"No, it’s not t"
"hat, but worse. "
"You will see. O,"
" Mary, he is too"
" good, he

     CHAPTER
 XV  When Nat�
�sha opened Prin
ce Andrew’s do
or with a famili
ar movement and 
 let Princess Ma
ry pass into the
 room before her
", the princess f"
elt the sobs in
 her throat. Har
d as she had tri
ed to prepare he
"rself, and now
"
tried to remain 
"tranquil, she kn"
ew that she woul
d be unable to l
ook at him with
out tears.  Th
e princess under
stood what Natá
sha had meant by
 the words: “t
wo days ago thi
s suddenly happe
ned.” She unde
rstood those wor
ds to mean that 
he had suddenly
 softened and th
at this softenin
g and gentleness
 were signs of 
approaching deat
h. As she steppe
d to the door sh
e already saw in
 imagination An
drew’s face as
 she remembered 
"it in childhood,"
" a gentle,
mild"
", sympathetic fa"
ce which he had 
"rarely shown, an"
d which therefor
e affected her 
very strongly. S
he was sure he w
"ould speak soft,"
 tender words t
o her such as he
r father had utt
ered before his 
"death, and
that"
 she would not b
e able to bear i
t and would burs
t into sobs in h
is presence. Ye
t sooner or late
"r it had to be, "
and she went in.
 The sobs rose 
higher and highe
r in her throat 
as she more and 
more clearly di
stinguished his 
form and her sho
rtsighted eyes t
ried to make out
" his
features, "
and then she saw
 his face and me
t his gaze.  H
e was lying in a
 squirrel-fur dr
essing gown on a
" divan, surround"
ed by pillows. 
He was thin and 
pale. In one thi
"n, translucently"
 white hand he 
held a handkerch
"ief, while with "
the other he str
oked the delicat
e mustache he h
"ad grown, moving"
 his fingers slo
wly. His eyes ga
zed at them as 
they entered.  
 On seeing his f
ace and meeting 
his eyes Princes
s Mary’s pace 
suddenly slacke
"ned, she felt he"
r tears dry up a
nd her sobs ceas
ed. She suddenly
 felt guilty an
d grew timid on 
catching the exp
ression of his f
ace and eyes. 
 “But in what
 am I to blame?�
�� she asked her
self. And his co
"ld, stern look
"
replied: “Beca
use you are aliv
e and thinking o
"f the living, wh"
ile I...”  I
n the deep gaze 
that seemed to l
ook not outwards
 but inwards the
re was an almos
t hostile expres
sion as he slowl
y regarded his s
ister and Natá
sha.  He kisse
"d his sister, ho"
lding her hand i
n his as was the
ir wont.  “H
"ow are you, Mary"
? How did you ma
nage to get here
?” said he in 
a voice as calm
 and aloof as hi
s look.  Had h
e screamed in ag
"ony, that scream"
 would not have 
struck such horr
or into Princes
s Mary’s heart
 as the tone of 
his voice.  �
�And have you br
ought little Nic
holas?” he ask
ed in the same s
"low, quiet
mann"
er and with an o
bvious effort to
 remember.  �
�How are you now
?” said Prince
"ss Mary, herself"
 surprised at wh
at she was sayi
"ng.

“That, "
"my dear, you mus"
t ask the doctor
",” he replied,"
 and again makin
g an evident ef
fort to be affec
"tionate, he said"
 with his lips o
nly (his words 
clearly did not 
correspond to hi
s thoughts):  
"“Merci, chère"
" amie, d’être"
 venue.” *  
    * “Thank y
"ou for coming, m"
y dear.”   
Princess Mary pr
essed his hand. 
The pressure mad
e him wince just
 perceptibly. H
"e was silent, an"
d she did not kn
ow what to say. 
She now underst
ood what had hap
pened to him two
 days before. In
" his words, his"
"
tone, and espec"
ially in that ca
"lm, almost antag"
onistic look cou
ld be felt an e
strangement from
 everything belo
nging to this wo
"rld, terrible
i"
n one who is ali
ve. Evidently on
ly with an effor
t did he underst
and anything li
ving; but it was
 obvious that he
 failed to under
"stand, not
beca"
use he lacked th
e power to do so
 but because he 
understood somet
hing else—som
ething the livin
g did not and co
uld not understa
nd—and which 
wholly occupied 
his mind.  “
"There, you see h"
ow strangely fat
e has brought us
" together,” sa"
"id he,
breaking"
 the silence and
 pointing to Nat
ásha. “She lo
oks after me all
 the time.” 
 Princess Mary 
heard him and di
d not understand
 how he could sa
y such a thing.
" He, the sensiti"
"ve, tender Princ"
"e Andrew, how co"
"uld he say that,"
 before her who
m he loved and w
ho loved him? Ha
d he expected to
 live he could 
not have said th
ose words in tha
t offensively co
ld tone. If he h
ad not known th
"at he was dying,"
 how could he ha
ve failed to pit
y her and how c
ould he speak li
ke that in her p
resence? The onl
y explanation wa
s that he was i
"ndifferent, beca"
use something el
"se, much more im"
"portant,
had be"
en revealed to h
im.  The conve
rsation was cold
 and disconnecte
d and continuall
y broke off.  
“Mary came by 
"way of Ryazán,�"
�� said Natásha
.  Prince Andr
ew did not notic
e that she calle
d his sister Mar
"y, and only
aft"
er calling her s
o in his presenc
e did Natásha n
otice it herself
.  “Really?�
�� he asked.  
“They told her
 that all Moscow
 has been burned
" down, and that."
..”  Natásh
a stopped. It wa
s impossible to 
talk. It was pla
in that he was 
making an effort
" to listen, but "
could not do so.
"

“Yes, they"
 say it’s burn
"ed,” he said. "
“It’s a grea
"t pity,” and h"
e gazed straigh
"t before him, ab"
sently stroking 
his mustache wit
h his fingers. 
 “And so you 
have met Count N
"icholas, Mary?�"
� Prince Andrew 
"suddenly said,
"
evidently wishin
g to speak pleas
antly to them. �
��He wrote here 
that he took a 
great liking to 
"you,” he went "
on simply and ca
"lmly, evidently"
 unable to under
stand all the co
mplex significan
ce his words had
 for living peo
ple. “If you l
"iked him too, it"
 would be a good
 thing for you 
"to get married,�"
�� he added rath
"er more quickly,"
 as if pleased a
t having found 
words he had lon
g been seeking. 
  Princess Mary
 heard his words
 but they had no
 meaning for her
", except as
a p"
roof of how far 
away he now was 
from everything 
living.  “Wh
y talk of me?”
 she said quietl
y and glanced at
 Natásha.  Na
"tásha, who felt"
" her glance, did"
 not look at her
. All three were
 again silent. 
"

“Andrew, wo"
uld you like...�
�� Princess Mary
 suddenly said i
n a trembling v
"oice, “would y"
ou like to see l
ittle Nicholas? 
He is always tal
king about you!
”  Prince An
drew smiled just
 perceptibly and
 for the first t
"ime, but
Prince"
"ss Mary, who kne"
w his face so we
"ll, saw with hor"
ror that he did 
 not smile with 
pleasure or affe
ction for his so
"n, but with quie"
"t, gentle
irony"
 because he thou
ght she was tryi
ng what she beli
eved to be the l
ast means of ar
ousing him.  �
"��Yes, I shall b"
e very glad to s
ee him. Is he qu
ite well?”  
When little Nich
olas was brought
 into Prince And
rew’s room he 
looked at his f
ather with frigh
"tened eyes, but "
"did not cry, bec"
ause no one else
 was crying. Pr
ince Andrew kiss
ed him and evide
ntly did not kno
w what to say t
o him.  When N
icholas had been
" led away, Princ"
ess Mary again w
ent up to her b
"rother, kissed h"
"im, and unable t"
o restrain her t
ears any longer 
began to cry. 
 He looked at h
er attentively. 
  “Is it abou
t Nicholas?” h
e asked.  Prin
cess Mary nodded
" her head, weepi"
"ng.

“Mary, "
you know the Gos
p...” but he b
roke off.  “
What did you say
?”  “Nothi
ng. You mustn’
"t cry here,” h"
"e said, looking "
at her with the 
same cold expre
ssion.   When
 Princess Mary b
"egan to cry, he "
understood that 
she was crying a
t the thought t
hat little Nicho
las would be lef
t without a fath
er. With a grea
t effort he trie
d to return to l
ife and to see t
hings from their
 point of view.
"

“Yes, to t"
hem it must seem
 sad!” he thou
ght. “But how 
simple it is.  
 “The fowls of
 the air sow not
", neither do the"
"y reap, yet your"
 Father feedeth
" them,” he sai"
d to himself and
 wished to say t
o Princess Mary;
"
“but no, the"
y will take it t
"heir own way, th"
ey won’t under
stand! They can
’t understand 
that all those f
eelings they pri
ze so—all our 
"feelings,
all t"
hose ideas that 
seem so importan
"t to us, are unn"
ecessary. We can
not understand 
"one another,” "
and he remained 
silent.   Pri
nce Andrew’s l
ittle son was se
ven. He could sc
"arcely read, and"
 knew nothing. 
After that day h
e lived through 
"many things, gai"
"ning knowledge,"
"
observation, an"
"d experience, bu"
t had he possess
ed all the facul
ties he afterwa
"rds acquired, he"
 could not have 
had a better or 
more profound u
nderstanding of 
the meaning of t
he scene he had 
witnessed betwee
"n
his father, M"
"ary, and Natásh"
"a, than he had t"
hen. He understo
od it completel
"y, and, leaving "
the room without
" crying, went si"
lently up to Na
tásha who had c
ome out with him
 and looked shyl
y at her with hi
"s
beautiful, th"
"oughtful eyes, t"
hen his uplifted
", rosy upper lip"
 trembled and l
eaning his head 
against her he b
egan to cry.  
After that he av
oided Dessalles 
and the countess
 who caressed hi
m and either sa
t alone or came 
timidly to Princ
"ess Mary, or to "
Natásha of whom
 he seemed even
 fonder than of 
"his aunt, and cl"
ung to them quie
tly and shyly. 
  When Princess
 Mary had left P
rince Andrew she
 fully understoo
d what Natásha
’s face had to
ld her. She did 
not speak any mo
re to Natásha o
f hopes of savi
ng his life. She
 took turns with
 her beside his 
"sofa, and
did n"
"ot cry any more,"
 but prayed cont
"inually, turning"
 in soul to that
 Eternal and Un
"fathomable, whos"
e presence above
 the dying man w
as now so evide
nt.      C
HAPTER XVI  No
t only did Princ
e Andrew know he
" would die, but "
he felt that he 
was dying and w
as already half 
dead. He was con
scious of an alo
ofness from eve
rything earthly 
and a strange an
d joyous lightne
ss of existence.
 Without haste 
or agitation he 
awaited what was
 coming. That in
"exorable,
etern"
"al, distant, and"
 unknown the pre
sence of which h
e had felt cont
inually all his 
life—was now n
"ear to him and, "
by the strange 
lightness he exp
"erienced, almost"
 comprehensible 
and palpable....
   Formerly h
e had feared the
 end. He had twi
ce experienced t
hat terribly to
rmenting fear of
 death—the end
—but now he no
 longer understo
od that fear. 
 He had felt it
 for the first t
ime when the she
ll spun like a t
"op before
him, "
and he looked at
 the fallow fiel
"d, the bushes, a"
"nd the sky, and"
 knew that he wa
s face to face w
ith death. When 
he came to himse
lf after being 
wounded and the 
flower of eterna
"l, unfettered lo"
ve had instantly
 unfolded itsel
f in his soul as
 if freed from t
he bondage of li
fe that had res
"trained it, he n"
o longer feared 
death and ceased
 to think about 
 it.  During t
he hours of soli
"tude, suffering,"
 and partial del
irium he spent 
after he was wou
"nded, the more d"
eeply he penetra
ted into the new
 principle of e
ternal love reve
"aled to him, the"
 more he unconsc
iously detached
 himself from ea
rthly life. To l
ove everything a
nd everybody and
 always to sacr
ifice oneself fo
r love meant not
" to love anyone,"
 not to live th
is earthly life.
 And the more im
bued he became w
ith that princi
"ple of love, the"
 more he renounc
ed life and the 
more completely 
he destroyed th
at dreadful barr
ier which—in t
he absence of su
ch love—stands
 between life a
nd death. When d
uring those firs
t days he rememb
ered that he wo
"uld have to die,"
 he said to hims
"elf: “Well, wh"
at of it? So muc
h the better!�
�  But after t
he night in Myt�
"�shchi when, hal"
"f delirious, he "
had seen her fo
r whom he longed
 appear before h
"im and, having p"
ressed her hand 
"to his
lips, ha"
"d shed gentle, h"
"appy tears, love"
 for a particula
r woman again c
rept unobserved 
into his heart a
nd once more bou
nd him to life. 
And joyful and 
agitating though
ts began to occu
py his mind. Rec
alling the mome
nt at the ambula
nce station when
 he had seen Kur
"ágin, he could "
not now regain 
the feeling he t
"hen had, but was"
 tormented by th
e question whet
her Kurágin was
 alive. And he d
ared not inquire
.  His illness
 pursued its nor
mal physical cou
"rse, but what Na"
tásha referred
 to when she sai
d: “This sudde
"nly happened,”"
 had occurred tw
o days before P
rincess Mary arr
ived. It was the
 last spiritual 
struggle betwee
n life and death
", in which death"
 gained the vict
ory. It was the
 unexpected real
ization of the f
act that he stil
l valued life as
 presented to h
im in the form o
f his love for N
"atásha, and a l"
"ast, though
ult"
imately vanquish
"ed, attack of te"
rror before the 
unknown.  It w
as evening. As u
sual after dinne
r he was slightl
"y feverish, and "
his thoughts we
re preternatural
ly clear. Sónya
 was sitting by 
the table. He b
egan to doze. Su
ddenly a feeling
 of happiness se
ized him.  “
"Ah, she has come"
!” thought he.
  And so it wa
s: in Sónya’s
 place sat Natá
sha who had just
 come in noisel
essly.  Since 
she had begun lo
"oking after him,"
 he had always e
xperienced this 
 physical consci
ousness of her n
earness. She was
 sitting in an a
rmchair placed 
"sideways, screen"
ing the light of
 the candle from
" him, and was
k"
nitting a stocki
ng. She had lear
ned to knit stoc
kings since Prin
ce Andrew had c
asually mentione
d that no one nu
rsed the sick so
 well as old nu
rses who knit st
"ockings, and tha"
t there is somet
hing soothing in
 the knitting o
f stockings. The
 needles clicked
 lightly in her 
"slender,
rapidl"
"y moving hands, "
and he could cle
arly see the tho
ughtful profile 
 of her drooping
 face. She moved
", and the ball r"
olled off her kn
ees. She starte
"d, glanced round"
" at him, and scr"
eening the candl
e with her hand 
 stooped careful
ly with a supple
 and exact movem
"ent, picked up t"
"he ball,
and re"
gained her forme
r position.  H
e looked at her 
without moving a
nd saw that she 
wanted to draw a
 deep breath af
"ter stooping, bu"
t refrained from
 doing so and br
eathed cautious
ly.  At the Tr
óitsa monastery
 they had spoken
" of the past, an"
d he had told h
er that if he li
ved he would alw
ays thank God fo
r his wound whic
h had brought t
hem together aga
"in, but after th"
at they never sp
oke of the futu
re.  “Can it
 or can it not b
e?” he now tho
ught as he looke
d at her and li
stened to the li
ght click of the
 steel needles. 
“Can fate have
 brought me to 
her so strangely
 only for me to 
die?... Is it po
ssible that the 
 truth of life h
as been revealed
 to me only to s
how me that I ha
ve spent my lif
e in falsity? I 
love her more th
an anything in t
he world! But wh
at am I to do i
f I love her?”
" he thought, and"
 he involuntaril
"y groaned,
from"
 a habit acquire
d during his suf
ferings.  On h
earing that soun
d Natásha put d
own the stocking
", leaned nearer "
"to
him, and sud"
"denly, noticing "
his shining eyes
", stepped lightl"
y up to him and
 bent over him. 
  “You are no
t asleep?”  
"“No, I have be"
en looking at yo
u a long time. I
 felt you come i
n. No one else 
gives me that se
nse of soft tran
quillity that yo
u do... that lig
ht. I want to w
eep for joy.” 
  Natásha drew
 closer to him. 
Her face shone w
ith rapturous jo
y.  “Natásh
"a, I love you to"
o much! More tha
n anything in th
e world.”  �
��And I!”—Sh
e turned away fo
r an instant. �
�Why too much?�
� she asked.  
“Why too much?
"... Well, what d"
"o you, what do y"
ou feel in your 
"soul, your
whol"
e soul—shall I
 live? What do y
ou think?”  
“I am sure of 
"it, sure!” Nat"
ásha almost sho
"uted, taking hol"
d of both his h
ands with a pass
ionate movement.
  He remained 
silent awhile. 
 “How good it
 would be!” an
d taking her han
d he kissed it. 
  Natásha felt
 happy and agita
"ted, but at once"
 remembered that
 this would not
 do and that he 
had to be quiet.
  “But you h
"ave not slept,�"
"� she said, repr"
essing her joy. 
“Try to sleep.
.. please!” 
 He pressed her
 hand and releas
"ed it, and she w"
ent back to the 
candle and sat 
down again in he
r former positio
n. Twice she tur
ned and looked a
"t
him, and her "
eyes met his bea
ming at her. She
 set herself a t
ask on her stoc
king and resolve
d not to turn ro
und till it was 
finished.  Soo
n he really shut
 his eyes and fe
ll asleep. He di
d not sleep long
 and suddenly a
woke with a star
t and in a cold 
perspiration.  
 As he fell asle
ep he had still 
been thinking of
 the subject tha
t now always oc
cupied his mind�
��about life and
" death, and chie"
fly about death.
 He felt himsel
f nearer to it. 
  “Love? What
 is love?” he 
thought.  “L
ove hinders deat
h. Love is life.
" All, everything"
 that I understa
"nd, I
understan"
d only because I
 love. Everythin
"g is, everything"
" exists, only
b"
ecause I love. E
verything is uni
ted by it alone.
" Love is God, an"
d to die means 
"that I, a partic"
"le of love, shal"
l return to the 
general and ete
rnal source.” 
These thoughts s
eemed to him com
forting. But the
y were only tho
ughts. Something
 was lacking in 
"them, they were "
"not clear, they"
 were too one-si
dedly personal a
nd brain-spun. A
nd there was the
 former agitati
on and obscurity
. He fell asleep
.  He dreamed 
that he was lyin
g in the room he
" really was in, "
but that he was
 quite well and 
unwounded. Many 
"various, indiffe"
"rent, and
insig"
nificant people 
appeared before 
him. He talked t
o them and disc
ussed something 
trivial. They we
re preparing to 
go away somewher
e. Prince Andre
w dimly realized
 that all this w
as trivial and t
hat he had more
 important cares
", but he continu"
"ed to speak, sur"
prising them by 
 empty witticism
"s. Gradually, un"
"noticed, all the"
se persons began
 to disappear a
nd a single ques
"tion, that of th"
"e closed door, s"
uperseded all e
lse. He rose and
 went to the doo
r to bolt and lo
ck it. Everythin
g depended on w
"hether he was, o"
"r was not, in ti"
me to lock it. H
"e went, and
tri"
"ed to hurry, but"
 his legs refuse
d to move and he
 knew he would n
ot be in time t
o lock the door 
though he painfu
lly strained all
 his powers. He 
 was seized by a
n agonizing fear
. And that fear 
was the fear of 
death. It stood
 behind the door
. But just when 
he was clumsily 
creeping toward 
"
the door, that "
dreadful somethi
ng on the other 
side was already
 pressing again
st it and forcin
g its way in. So
mething not huma
n—death—was 
 breaking in thr
"ough that door, "
and had to be ke
pt out. He seize
"d the
door, mak"
ing a final effo
rt to hold it ba
ck—to lock it 
was no longer p
ossible—but hi
s efforts were w
eak and clumsy a
"nd the door, pus"
hed from behind
" by that terror,"
 opened and clos
ed again.  Onc
e again it pushe
d from outside. 
His last superhu
man efforts were
 vain and both 
halves of the do
or noiselessly o
pened. It entere
"d, and it was
d"
"eath, and Prince"
 Andrew died.  
 But at the inst
"ant he died, Pri"
nce Andrew remem
bered that he wa
"s asleep,
and a"
t the very insta
"nt he died, havi"
ng made an effor
"t, he awoke.

"
"“Yes, it was d"
eath! I died—a
"nd woke up. Yes,"
 death is an awa
kening!” And 
all at once it g
rew light in his
 soul and the ve
il that had till
 then concealed
 the unknown was
 lifted from his
 spiritual visio
n. He felt as i
f powers till th
en confined with
in him had been 
"liberated, and t"
hat strange lig
htness did not a
gain leave him. 
"

When, waking "
in a cold perspi
"ration, he moved"
" on the divan, N"
atásha went up
 and asked him w
hat was the matt
er. He did not a
nswer and looked
 at her strange
"ly, not understa"
nding.  That w
as what had happ
ened to him two 
days before Prin
cess Mary’s a
rrival. From tha
"t day, as the do"
ctor expressed i
"t, the wasting f"
ever assumed a 
malignant charac
"ter, but what th"
e doctor said di
d not interest 
"Natásha, she sa"
w the terrible m
oral symptoms wh
ich to her were 
more convincing
.  From that d
ay an awakening 
from life came t
o Prince Andrew 
together with h
is awakening fro
m sleep. And com
pared to the dur
ation of life it
 did not seem t
o him slower tha
n an awakening f
rom sleep compar
ed to the durat
ion of a dream. 
  There was not
hing terrible or
 violent in this
 comparatively s
low awakening. 
  His last days
 and hours passe
d in an ordinary
 and simple way.
 Both Princess 
Mary and Natásh
"a, who did not l"
"eave him, felt t"
his. They did n
ot weep or shudd
er and during th
ese last days th
ey themselves fe
lt that they we
re not attending
 on him (he was 
"no longer there,"
 he had left th
em) but on what 
reminded them mo
st closely of hi
m—his body. Bo
th felt this so
 strongly that t
he outward and t
errible side of 
death did not a
ffect them and t
hey did not feel
 it necessary to
 foment their gr
ief. Neither in
 his presence no
r out of it did 
"they weep, nor d"
id they ever ta
lk to one anothe
r about him. The
y felt that they
 could not expre
ss in words wha
t they understoo
d.  They both 
saw that he was 
sinking slowly a
"nd quietly, deep"
"er and deeper,
"
"away from them, "
and they both kn
ew that this had
 to be so and th
at it was right
.  He confesse
"d, and received "
communion: every
one came to take
 leave of him. 
When they brough
t his son to him
", he pressed his"
 lips to the boy
’s and turned
" away, not becau"
se he felt it ha
rd and sad (Prin
cess Mary and N
atásha understo
od that) but sim
ply because he t
hought it was al
l that was requ
"ired of him, but"
 when they told 
him to bless the
" boy, he did
wh"
at was demanded 
and looked round
 as if asking wh
ether there was 
 anything else h
e should do.  
When the last co
nvulsions of the
" body, which the"
 spirit was leav
"ing,
occurred, "
Princess Mary an
d Natásha were 
present.  “I
s it over?” sa
id Princess Mary
 when his body h
ad for a few min
utes lain motio
"nless, growing c"
old before them.
 Natásha went u
"p, looked at
th"
"e dead eyes, and"
 hastened to clo
se them. She clo
sed them but did
" not
kiss them,"
 but clung to th
at which reminde
d her most nearl
y of him—his 
body.  “Wher
e has he gone? W
here is he now?.
..”  When th
"e body, washed a"
"nd dressed, lay "
in the coffin on
" a table,
every"
one came to take
 leave of him an
d they all wept.
  Little Nicho
las cried becaus
e his heart was 
rent by painful 
perplexity. The
 countess and S�
�nya cried from 
pity for Natásh
a and because he
 was no more. T
he old count cri
ed because he fe
lt that before l
"ong, he, too,
m"
ust take the sam
e terrible step.
  Natásha and
 Princess Mary a
"lso wept now, bu"
t not because of
 their own pers
onal grief; they
 wept with a rev
erent and soften
ing emotion whic
h had taken pos
session of their
 souls at the co
nsciousness of t
he simple and s
olemn mystery of
 death that had 
been accomplishe
d in their pres
ence.      
 BOOK THIRTEEN: 
1812      
CHAPTER I  Man
’s mind cannot
 grasp the cause
s of events in t
heir completenes
"s, but
the desi"
re to find those
 causes is impla
nted in man’s 
soul. And withou
t considering t
he multiplicity 
and complexity o
f the conditions
 any one of whi
ch taken separat
ely may seem to 
"be the cause, he"
 snatches at the
 first approxim
ation to a cause
 that seems to h
im intelligible 
and says: “Th
is is the cause!
” In historica
l events (where 
the actions of m
en are the subj
ect of observati
on) the first an
d most primitive
 approximation 
to present itsel
f was the will o
"f the gods and, "
"after that, the "
will of those w
ho stood in the 
most prominent p
osition—the he
roes of history.
 But we need on
ly penetrate to 
the essence of a
ny historic even
t—which lies 
in the activity 
of the general m
ass of men who t
ake part in it�
�to be convince
d that the will 
of the historic 
hero does not co
ntrol the actio
ns of the mass b
ut is itself con
tinually control
led. It may seem
 to be a matter
 of indifference
 whether we unde
rstand the meani
ng of historica
l events this wa
y or that; yet t
here is the same
 difference bet
ween a man who s
ays that the peo
ple of the West 
moved on the Eas
t because Napol
eon wished it an
d a man who says
 that this happe
ned because it 
"had to happen, a"
s there is betwe
en those who dec
lared that the 
earth was statio
nary and that th
e planets moved 
round it and tho
se who admitted
 that they did n
ot know what uph
"eld the earth, b"
ut knew there w
ere laws directi
ng its movement 
and that of the 
other planets. T
"here
is, and ca"
"n be, no cause o"
f an historical 
event except the
 one cause of a
ll causes. But t
here are laws di
"recting events, "
and some of thes
e laws are know
n to us while we
 are conscious o
f others we cann
ot comprehend. 
The discovery of
 these laws is o
nly possible whe
n we have quite 
 abandoned the a
ttempt to find t
he cause in the 
will of some one
" man,
just as t"
he discovery of 
the laws of the 
motion of the pl
anets was possi
ble only when me
n abandoned the 
conception of th
e fixity of the 
 earth.  The h
istorians consid
"er that, next to"
 the battle of B
orodinó and the
 occupation of 
Moscow by the en
emy and its dest
"ruction by fire,"
 the most impor
tant episode of 
the war of 1812 
was the movement
 of the Russian 
 army from the R
yazána to the K
alúga road and 
to the Tarútino
 camp—the so-
called flank mar
ch across the Kr
ásnaya Pakhrá 
River. They ascr
ibe the glory o
f that achieveme
nt of genius to 
different men an
d dispute as to 
 whom the honor 
is due. Even for
"eign historians,"
 including the F
"rench,
acknowle"
dge the genius o
f the Russian co
mmanders when th
ey speak of tha
t flank march. B
ut it is hard to
 understand why 
military writers
",
and following"
" them others, co"
nsider this flan
k march to be th
e profound conc
eption of some o
ne man who saved
 Russia and dest
royed Napoleon. 
In the first pl
ace it is hard t
o understand whe
re the profundit
y and genius of
 this movement l
"ay, for not much"
 mental effort w
as needed to see
 that the best 
position for an 
army when it is 
not being attack
ed is where the
re are most prov
isions; and even
 a dull boy of t
hirteen could ha
ve guessed that
 the best positi
on for an army a
fter its retreat
 from Moscow in
 1812 was on the
 Kalúga road. S
o it is impossib
le to understand
 by what reason
ing the historia
ns reach the con
clusion that thi
s maneuver was 
a profound one. 
And it is even m
ore difficult to
 understand just
 why they think
 that this maneu
ver was calculat
ed to save Russi
a and destroy t
he French; for t
"his flank march,"
 had it been pre
"ceded, accompani"
"ed,
or followed"
 by other circum
"stances, might h"
ave proved ruino
us to the Russi
ans and salutary
 for the French.
 If the position
 of the Russian 
 army really beg
an to improve fr
om the time of t
"hat march, it do"
es not at all f
ollow that the m
arch was the cau
se of it.  Tha
t flank march mi
ght not only hav
e failed to give
 any advantage t
o the Russian a
"rmy, but might i"
n other circumst
ances have led t
o its destructi
on. What would h
ave happened had
 Moscow not burn
ed down? If Mur
at had not lost 
sight of the Rus
sians? If Napole
on had not remai
ned inactive? I
f the Russian ar
my at Krásnaya 
Pakhrá had give
n battle as Ben
nigsen and Barcl
ay advised? What
 would have happ
ened had the Fre
nch attacked th
e Russians while
 they were march
ing beyond the P
akhrá? What wo
uld have happene
d if on approach
"ing Tarútino, N"
apoleon had atta
cked the Russia
ns with but a te
nth of the energ
y he had shown w
hen he attacked
 them at Smolén
sk? What would h
ave happened had
 the French move
d on Petersburg
?... In any of t
hese eventualiti
es the flank mar
ch that brought
 salvation might
 have proved dis
astrous.  The 
third and most i
ncomprehensible 
thing is that pe
ople studying h
istory deliberat
ely avoid seeing
 that this flank
 march cannot be
 attributed to 
"any one man, tha"
t no one ever fo
"resaw it, and th"
"at in
reality, "
like the retreat
" from Filí, it "
did not suggest 
itself to anyone
 in its entiret
"y, but resulted�"
��moment by mome
"nt, step by step"
", event by
even"
t—from an endl
ess number of mo
st diverse circu
mstances and was
 only seen in i
ts entirety when
 it had been acc
omplished and be
longed to the p
ast.  At the c
ouncil at Filí 
the prevailing t
hought in the mi
nds of the Russ
ian commanders w
as the one natur
ally suggesting 
"itself, namely, "
a direct retrea
t by the Nízhni
 road. In proof 
of this there is
 the fact that 
the majority of 
the council vote
d for such a ret
"reat, and above"
 all there is th
e well-known con
versation after 
"the council, bet"
ween the comman
der in chief and
" Lanskóy, who w"
as in charge of 
the commissariat
 department. La
nskóy informed 
the commander in
 chief that the 
army supplies w
ere for the most
 part stored alo
ng the Oká in t
he Túla and Ry
"azán provinces,"
 and that if the
y retreated on N
ízhni the army 
would be separa
ted from its sup
plies by the bro
"ad river Oká, w"
hich cannot be 
crossed early in
 winter. This wa
s the first indi
cation of the ne
cessity of devi
ating from what 
had previously s
eemed the most n
atural course—
a direct retrea
t on Nízhni-Nó
vgorod. The army
 turned more to 
"the south,
alon"
g the Ryazán ro
ad and nearer to
 its supplies. S
ubsequently the 
 inactivity of t
he French (who e
ven lost sight o
f the Russian ar
"my),
concern fo"
r the safety of 
the arsenal at T
"úla, and especi"
ally the advant
ages of drawing 
nearer to its su
pplies caused th
e army to turn 
still further so
uth to the Túla
 road. Having cr
"ossed over, by a"
" forced
march, "
to the Túla roa
d beyond the Pak
"hrá, the Russia"
n commanders in
tended to remain
 at Podólsk and
 had no thought 
of the Tarútino
 position; but 
innumerable circ
umstances and th
e reappearance o
f French troops
 who had for a t
ime lost touch w
ith the Russians
", and projects
"
of giving battle
", and above all "
the abundance of
 provisions in K
alúga province
", obliged our ar"
my to turn still
 more to the sou
th and to cross 
 from the Túla 
to the Kalúga r
oad and go to Ta
"rútino, which w"
as between the 
roads along whic
h those supplies
 lay. Just as it
 is impossible t
o say when it w
as decided to ab
"andon Moscow, so"
 it is impossibl
e to say precis
"ely when, or by "
"whom, it was dec"
ided to move to 
Tarútino. Only 
 when the army h
"ad got there, as"
 the result of i
nnumerable and v
"arying
forces, "
did people begin
 to assure thems
elves that they 
had desired this
 movement and l
ong ago foreseen
 its result.  
    CHAPTER 
II  The famous
 flank movement 
merely consisted
 in this: after 
the advance of 
the French had c
"eased, the Russi"
"an army, which h"
ad been continua
lly retreating 
straight back fr
"om the invaders,"
 deviated from t
hat direct cour
"se and, not find"
ing itself pursu
"ed, was naturall"
y drawn toward t
he district whe
re supplies were
 abundant.  If
 instead of imag
ining to ourselv
es commanders of
 genius leading 
the Russian arm
"y, we picture th"
at army without 
"any leaders, it "
could not have 
done anything bu
t make a return 
movement toward 
"Moscow, describi"
ng an arc in th
e direction wher
e most provision
s were to be fou
nd and where th
e country was ri
chest.  That m
ovement from the
 Nízhni to the 
"Ryazán, Túla, "
and Kalúga road
s was so natura
l that even the 
Russian marauder
s moved in that 
"direction, and
"
demands were sen
t from Petersbur
g for Kutúzov t
o take his army 
that way. At Ta
rútino Kutúzov
 received what w
as almost a repr
imand from the 
Emperor for havi
ng moved his arm
y along the Ryaz
"án road, and th"
e Emperor’s l
etter indicated 
to him the very 
position he had 
already occupie
d near Kalúga. 
  Having rolled
 like a ball in 
the direction of
 the impetus giv
en by the whole
 campaign and by
 the battle of B
"orodinó, the Ru"
ssian army—whe
n the strength 
of that impetus 
was exhausted an
d no fresh push 
was received—
assumed the posi
tion natural to 
it.  Kutúzov�
"��s merit lay, n"
ot in any strate
gic maneuver of 
"genius, as it is"
"
called, but in"
 the fact that h
e alone understo
od the significa
nce of what had
 happened. He al
one then underst
ood the meaning 
of the French a
rmy’s inactivi
"ty, he alone con"
tinued to assert
 that the battle
 of Borodinó h
ad been a victor
"y, he alone—wh"
o as commander i
n chief might h
ave been expecte
d to be eager to
 attack—employ
ed his whole str
ength to restra
in the Russian a
rmy from useless
 engagements.  
 The beast wound
ed at Borodinó 
was lying where 
the fleeing hunt
er had left him
; but whether he
 was still alive
", whether he was"
 strong and mer
"ely lying low, t"
he hunter did no
t know. Suddenly
 the beast was h
eard to moan. 
 The moan of th
at wounded beast
 (the French arm
y) which betraye
d its calamitou
s condition was 
the sending of L
auriston to Kut�
�zov’s camp wi
th overtures fo
r peace.  Napo
"leon, with his u"
sual assurance t
hat whatever ent
ered his head wa
"s
right, wrote "
to Kutúzov the 
first words that
 occurred to him
", though
they w"
ere meaningless.
   MONSIEUR L
E PRINCE KOUTOUZ
OV: I am sending
 one of my adjut
ants-general to
 discuss several
 interesting que
stions with you.
 I beg your High
ness to credit 
what he says to 
"you, especially "
when he expresse
s the sentiment
 of esteem and s
pecial regard I 
have long entert
ained for your 
person. This let
ter having no ot
"her object, I pr"
"ay God, monsieur"

"ouzov, to keep y"
ou in His holy a
nd gracious prot
ection!  NAPOL
"EON

MOSCOW, O"
"CTOBER 30, 1812"
   Kutúzov re
plied: “I shou
ld be cursed by 
posterity were I
 looked on as t
he initiator of 
a settlement of 
any sort. Such i
s the present sp
irit of my nati
on.” But he co
ntinued to exert
 all his powers 
to restrain his 
 troops from att
acking.  Durin
g the month that
 the French troo
ps were pillagin
g in Moscow and 
 the Russian tro
ops were quietly
 encamped at Tar
"útino, a change"
 had taken plac
e in the relativ
e strength of th
e two armies—b
oth in spirit an
d in number—a
s a result of wh
ich the superior
ity had passed t
o the Russian s
ide. Though the 
condition and nu
mbers of the Fre
nch army were un
known to the Ru
"ssians, as soon "
as that change o
ccurred the need
 of attacking a
t once showed it
self by countles
s signs. These s
igns were: Lauri
ston’s missio
n; the abundance
 of provisions a
t Tarútino; the
 reports coming 
in from all sid
es of the inacti
vity and disorde
r of the French;
 the flow of re
cruits to our re
giments; the fin
e weather; the l
ong rest the Rus
sian soldiers h
"ad enjoyed, and "
the impatience t
o do what they h
ad been assembl
"ed for, which us"
ually shows itse
lf in an army th
at has been res
ting; curiosity 
as to what the F
"rench army, so l"
ong lost sight o
"f,
was doing; t"
he boldness with
 which our outpo
sts now scouted 
close up to the
 French statione
d at Tarútino; 
the news of easy
 successes gaine
d by peasants a
nd guerrilla tro
ops over the Fre
"nch, the envy ar"
oused by this; 
the desire for r
evenge that lay 
in the heart of 
every Russian as
 long as the Fr
ench were in Mos
"cow, and (above "
all) a dim consc
iousness in ever
y soldier’s m
ind that the rel
ative strength o
f the armies had
 changed and th
at the advantage
 was now on our 
side. There was 
a substantial ch
ange in the rel
"ative strength, "
and an advance h
ad become inevit
able. And at on
"ce, as a clock b"
egins to strike 
and chime as soo
n as the minute 
hand has comple
ted a full circl
"e, this change w"
as shown by an i
ncreased activi
"ty, whirring, an"
d chiming in the
 higher spheres.
      CHAP
TER III  The R
ussian army was 
commanded by Kut
úzov and his st
"aff, and also by"
 the Emperor fr
om Petersburg. B
efore the news o
f the abandonmen
t of Moscow had
 been received i
"n Petersburg, a "
detailed plan of
 the whole campa
ign had been dr
awn up and sent 
to Kutúzov for 
his guidance. Th
ough this plan 
had been drawn u
p on the supposi
tion that Moscow
 was still in ou
"r hands,
it was"
 approved by the
 staff and accep
ted as a basis f
or action. Kut�
�zov only replie
d that movements
 arranged from a
 distance were a
lways difficult
 to execute. So 
fresh instructio
ns were sent for
 the solution o
f difficulties t
hat might be enc
"ountered, as wel"
l as fresh peopl
e who were to w
atch Kutúzov’
s actions and re
port upon them. 
"

Besides this,"
 the whole staff
 of the Russian 
army was now reo
rganized. The p
osts left vacant
" by Bagratión, "
who had been kil
"led, and by
Bar"
"clay, who had go"
ne away in dudge
"on, had to be fi"
lled. Very serio
us consideratio
n was given to t
he question whet
her it would be 
better to put A
 in B’s place 
"and B in D’s, "
or on the contra
ry to put D in A
"’s
place, and"
 so on—as if a
nything more tha
n A’s or B’s
 satisfaction d
epended on this.
  As a result 
of the hostility
 between Kutúzo
"v and Bennigsen,"
 his Chief of S
"taff, the presen"
ce of confidenti
al representativ
es of the Empero
"r, and
these tr"
"ansfers, a more "
than usually com
plicated play of
 parties was go
ing on among the
 staff of the ar
my. A was underm
"ining B, D was
"
"undermining C, a"
nd so on in all 
possible combina
tions and permut
ations. In all 
these plottings 
the subject of i
ntrigue was gene
rally the conduc
"t
of the war, w"
hich all these m
en believed they
 were directing;
 but this affai
r of the war wen
t on independent
"ly of them, as i"
t had to go: th
"at is, never in "
the way people d
"evised, but flow"
ing always from 
the essential a
ttitude of the m
asses. Only in t
he highest spher
es did all thes
"e schemes, cross"
"ings, and interm"
inglings appear 
to be a true re
flection of what
 had to happen.

"a fourth, rather"
 considerable de

 In view of all 
this information

 has scattered

 it possible tha

n the second of 
October a Cossac

who was out scou

killed on"

owing the wounde
d hare he made 
his way far into
 the forest and 
came upon the le

amped there with
out any precauti

 laughingly tol
d his comrades h
ow he had almost
 fallen into the

A cornet,"
 hearing the sto

he Cossack was s

" some horses, bu"
t one of the su
"perior officers,"
 who was acquain

"her authorities,"
 reported the i
ncident to a gen
eral on the staf
f. The state of 
things on the s
taff had of late
 been exceedingl
y strained. Erm�

 see Bennigsen 
a few days previ
ously and had en
treated him to u
se his influenc

 induce him to t

     CHAPTE
R IV  Bennigse
n’s note and t
he Cossack’s i
nformation that 
the left flank 
of the French wa
s unguarded were
 merely final in
dications that i
t was necessary
 to order an att
"ack, and it was "
fixed for the fi
fth of October. 
  On the mornin
g of the fourth 
of October Kutú
zov signed the d
ispositions. To
ll read them to 
"Ermólov, asking"
 him to attend t
o the further a
rrangements.  
“All right—a
ll right. I have
n’t time just 
"now,” replied "
"Ermólov, and
l"
eft the hut.  
The dispositions
 drawn up by Tol
l were very good
. As in the Aust
erlitz disposit
"ions, it was wri"
tten—though no
t in German this
 time:  “The
 First Column wi
ll march here an
"d here,” “th"
e Second Column 
will march ther
"e and there,” "
and so on; and o
"n paper, all the"
se columns arri
ved at their pla
ces at the appoi
nted time and de
stroyed the enem
y. Everything h
ad been admirabl
y thought out as
 is usual in dis
"positions,
and "
as is always the
" case, not a sin"
gle column reach
ed its place at 
the appointed t
ime.  When the
 necessary numbe
r of copies of t
he dispositions 
had been prepar
"ed, an officer w"
as summoned and 
sent to deliver 
them to Ermólov
 to deal with. 
A young officer 
of the Horse Gua
"rds, Kutúzov’"
"s orderly,
plea"
sed at the impor
tance of the mis
sion entrusted t
"o him, went to
"
Ermólov’s qua
rters.  “Gon
"e away,” said "
Ermólov’s ord
erly.  The off
icer of the Hors
e Guards went to
 a general with 
whom Ermólov wa
s often to be f
"ound.

“No, "
and the general�
��s out too.” 
"

The officer, "
mounting his hor
"se, rode off to "
someone else.  
"
“No, he’s g"
one out.”  �
��If only they d
on’t make me r
esponsible for t
his delay! What 
a nuisance it i
s!” thought th
"e officer, and h"
e rode round the
 whole camp. One
 man said he ha
d seen Ermólov 
ride past with s
ome other genera
"ls, others said"
 he must have re
turned home. The
 officer searche
d till six o’c
lock in the eve
ning without eve
n stopping to ea
t. Ermólov was 
nowhere to be fo
und and no one 
knew where he wa
s. The officer s
natched a little
 food at a comr
"ade’s, and rod"
e again to the v
anguard to find 
Milorádovich. 
Milorádovich to
"o was away, but "
here he was told
 that he had gon
e to a ball at 
General Kíkin�
�s and that Erm�
�lov was probabl
y there too.  
“But where is 
it?”  “Why
", there, over at"
" Échkino,” sa"
id a Cossack off
"icer, pointing t"
o a country hou
se in the far di
stance.  “Wh
"at, outside our "
line?”  “T
hey’ve put two
 regiments as ou
"tposts, and they"
’re having suc
h a spree there
", it’s awful! "
Two bands and th
ree sets of sing
ers!”  The o
fficer rode out 
beyond our lines
 to Échkino. Wh
ile still at a 
distance he hear
d as he rode the
 merry sounds of
 a soldier’s d
ance song proce
eding from the h
ouse.  “In t
he meadows... in
 the meadows!”
" he heard, accom"
panied by whistl
ing and the sou
"nd of a torban, "
drowned every no
w and then by sh
outs. These sou
nds made his spi
"rits rise, but a"
t the same time 
he was afraid th
at he would be 
blamed for not h
aving executed s
ooner the import
ant order entru
sted to him. It 
was already past
 eight o’clock
. He dismounted 
 and went up int
o the porch of a
 large country h
ouse which had r
emained intact 
between the Russ
ian and French f
orces. In the re
freshment room 
"and the hall, fo"
otmen were bustl
ing about with w
ine and viands. 
Groups of singe
rs stood outside
 the windows. Th
e officer was ad
mitted and imme
diately saw all 
the chief genera
ls of the army t
"ogether, and amo"
ng them Ermólo
v’s big imposi
ng figure. They 
all had their co
ats unbuttoned 
and were standin
g in a semicircl
e with flushed a
nd animated face
"s,
laughing lou"
dly. In the midd
le of the room a
 short handsome 
general with a 
red face was dan
cing the trepák
 with much spiri
t and agility. 
"
“Ha, ha, ha!"
" Bravo, Nicholas"
" Iványch! Ha, h"
"a, ha!”

The"
 officer felt th
at by arriving w
ith important or
ders at such a m
oment he was do
"ubly to blame, a"
nd he would have
 preferred to wa
it; but one of 
the generals esp
"ied him and, hea"
ring what he had
" come about, inf"
ormed Ermólov.
  Ermólov cam
e forward with a
 frown on his fa
"ce and, hearing "
what the office
"r had to say, to"
ok the papers fr
om him without a
 word.   “Y
ou think he went
 off just by cha
nce?” said a c
"omrade, who was "
on the staff th
"at evening, to t"
he officer of th
"e Horse Guards, "
referring to Er
mólov. “It wa
s a trick. It wa
s done on purpos
e to get Konovn�
�tsyn into trou
ble. You’ll se
e what a mess th
ere’ll be tomo
rrow.”    
  CHAPTER V  
 Next day the de
"crepit Kutúzov,"
 having given or
ders to be calle
"d early,
said h"
"is prayers, dres"
"sed, and, with a"
n unpleasant con
sciousness of h
aving to direct 
a battle he did 
"not approve of, "
got into his cal
èche and drove
 from Letashóvk
a (a village thr
ee and a half mi
les from Tarút
ino) to the plac
e where the atta
cking columns we
re to meet. He s
at in the calè
"che, dozing and "
waking up by tur
"ns, and listenin"
g for any sound
 of firing on th
e right as an in
dication that th
e action had beg
un. But all was
 still quiet. A 
damp dull autumn
 morning was jus
t dawning. On a
pproaching Tarú
tino Kutúzov no
ticed cavalrymen
 leading their h
orses to water 
across the road 
along which he w
as driving. Kut�
�zov looked at 
them searchingly
", stopped his ca"
"rriage, and inqu"
ired what regime
nt they belonge
d to. They belon
ged to a column 
that should have
 been far in fr
ont and in ambus
h long before th
en. “It may be
" a mistake,” t"
hought the old 
commander in chi
ef. But a little
 further on he s
aw infantry reg
iments with thei
r arms piled and
" the soldiers, o"
nly partly dress
"ed,
eating thei"
r rye porridge a
nd carrying fuel
. He sent for an
 officer. The o
fficer reported 
that no order to
 advance had bee
n received.  �
��How! Not rec..
.” Kutúzov be
"gan, but checked"
 himself immedia
tely and sent f
or a senior offi
cer. Getting out
 of his calèche
", he waited with"
 drooping head 
and breathing he
"avily, pacing si"
lently up and do
wn. When Eýkhe
"n, the officer o"
f the general st
aff whom he had 
"summoned, appear"
"ed,
Kutúzov we"
nt purple in the
" face, not becau"
se that officer 
was to blame fo
"r the mistake, b"
ut because he wa
s an object of s
ufficient import
ance for him to
 vent his wrath 
on. Trembling an
d panting the ol
d man fell into
 that state of f
ury in which he 
sometimes used t
o roll on the g
"round, and he fe"
"ll upon Eýkhen,"
 threatening him
" with his hands,"
 shouting and l
oading him with 
gross abuse. Ano
"ther man, Captai"
"n Brózin,
who "
happened to turn
 up and who was 
not at all to bl
"ame, suffered th"
e same fate.  
 “What sort of
 another blackgu
ard are you? I�
�ll have you sho
t! Scoundrels!�
�� yelled Kutúz
ov in a hoarse v
"oice, waving his"
 arms and reeli
ng.  He was su
ffering physical
"ly. He, the comm"
"ander in chief, "
a Serene Highne
ss who everybody
 said possessed 
powers such as n
o man had ever h
"ad
in Russia, t"
o be placed in t
his position—m
ade the laughing
stock of the wh
ole army! “I n
eedn’t have be
en in such a hur
ry to pray about
" today,
or have"
 kept awake thin
king everything 
"over all night,�"
�� thought he to
 himself. “Wh
en I was a chit 
of an officer no
 one would have 
dared to mock m
e so... and now!
” He was in a 
state of physica
l suffering as i
f from corporal
" punishment, and"
 could not avoid
 expressing it b
y cries of ange
r and distress. 
But his strength
 soon began to f
"ail him, and loo"
"king
about him,"
 conscious of ha
ving said much t
"hat was amiss, h"
e again got int
o his calèche a
nd drove back in
 silence.  His
" wrath, once exp"
"ended, did not r"
"eturn, and blink"
ing feebly he l
istened to excus
es and self-just
ifications (Erm�
�lov did not com
e to see him ti
ll the next day)
 and to the insi
stence of Bennig
"sen, Konovnítsy"
"n,
and Toll tha"
t the movement t
hat had miscarri
ed should be exe
cuted next day.
 And once more K
utúzov had to c
onsent.     
  CHAPTER VI  
 Next day the tr
oops assembled i
n their appointe
d places in the 
evening and adv
anced during the
 night. It was a
n autumn night w
ith dark purple 
"
clouds, but no "
rain. The ground
 was damp but no
"t muddy, and the"
 troops advance
"d noiselessly, o"
nly occasionally
 a jingling of t
he artillery co
uld be faintly h
eard. The men we
re forbidden to 
"talk out loud, t"
o smoke their p
"ipes, or to stri"
"ke a light, and "
they tried to pr
event their hor
ses neighing. Th
e secrecy of the
 undertaking hei
ghtened its char
m and they marc
hed gaily. Some 
"columns, supposi"
ng they had reac
hed their desti
"nation, halted, "
"piled arms, and "
settled down on 
"the cold ground,"
 but the majori
ty marched all n
ight and arrived
 at places where
 they evidently
 should not have
 been.  Only C
ount Orlóv-Den�
�sov with his Co
ssacks (the leas
t important det
achment of all) 
got to his appoi
nted place at th
e right time. Th
is detachment h
alted at the out
skirts of a fore
"st, on the path "
leading from th
e village of Str
omílova to Dmí
trovsk.  Towar
"d dawn, Count Or"
"lóv-Denísov, w"
ho had dozed off
", was awakened b"
y a deserter fr
om the French ar
my being brought
 to him. This wa
s a Polish serg
eant of Poniatow
"ski’s corps, w"
ho explained in 
Polish that he h
ad come over be
cause he had bee
n slighted in th
e service: that 
he ought long a
go to have been 
"made an officer,"
 that he was bra
ver than any of 
"
them, and so he"
 had left them a
nd wished to pay
 them out. He sa
id that Murat w
as spending the 
night less than 
a mile from wher
"e they were,
an"
d that if they w
ould let him hav
e a convoy of a 
hundred men he w
ould capture hi
m alive. Count O
rlóv-Denísov c
onsulted his fel
low officers.  
 The offer was t
oo tempting to b
e refused. Every
one volunteered 
to go and every
body advised mak
ing the attempt.
 After much disp
uting and arguin
"g,
Major-Genera"
l Grékov with t
wo Cossack regim
ents decided to 
go with the Pol
ish sergeant.  
"
“Now, remembe"
"r,” said Count"
 Orlóv-Denísov
 to the sergeant
" at parting,
�"
�if you have bee
n lying I’ll h
ave you hanged l
ike a dog; but i
f it’s true y
ou shall have a 
hundred gold pie
ces!”  Witho
"ut replying, the"
" sergeant, with "
"a resolute air, "
mounted and rode
 away with Gré
kov whose men ha
d quickly assemb
led. They disapp
eared into the 
"forest, and Coun"
t Orlóv-Deníso
"v, having seen G"
"rékov off, retu"
"rned,
shivering"
 from the freshn
ess of the early
 dawn and excite
d by what he ha
d undertaken on 
his own responsi
"bility, and bega"
n looking at the
" enemy
camp, no"
w just visible i
n the deceptive 
light of dawn an
d the dying cam
pfires. Our colu
mns ought to hav
e begun to appea
r on an open de
clivity to his r
ight. He looked 
in that directio
"n, but though th"
e columns would
 have been visib
le quite far off
", they were not "
to be seen. It 
seemed to the co
unt that things 
were beginning t
o stir in the Fr
"ench
camp, and "
his keen-sighted
 adjutant confir
med this.  “
"Oh, it is really"
" too late,” sa"
"id Count Orlóv,"
 looking at the 
camp.  As ofte
n happens when s
omeone we have t
rusted is no lon
ger before our 
"eyes, it suddenl"
y seemed quite c
lear and obvious
 to him that the
 sergeant was a
"n impostor, that"
" he had lied, an"
d that the whole
 Russian attack
 would be ruined
 by the absence 
of those two reg
"iments, which
h"
e would lead awa
y heaven only kn
ew where. How co
uld one capture 
a commander in 
chief from among
 such a mass of 
troops!  “I 
am sure that ras
"cal was lying,�"
� said the count
.  “They can
 still be called
" back,” said o"
"ne of his suite,"
 who like Count 
 Orlóv felt dis
trustful of the 
adventure when h
e looked at the 
enemy’s camp.
  “Eh? Reall
y... what do you
 think? Should w
e let them go on
 or not?”  �
��Will you have 
them fetched bac
k?”  “Fetc
"h them back, fet"
ch them back!”
 said Count Orl�
�v with sudden 
"determination, l"
ooking at his wa
tch. “It will 
be too late. It 
is quite light.
”  And the a
djutant galloped
 through the for
est after Gréko
v. When Grékov 
"
returned, Count"
 Orlóv-Denísov
", excited both b"
y the abandoned 
attempt and by 
vainly awaiting 
the infantry col
umns that still 
"did not appear, "
as well as by t
he proximity of 
"the enemy, resol"
ved to advance. 
All his men fel
t the same excit
ement.  “Mou
nt!” he comman
ded in a whisper
. The men took t
heir places and 
 crossed themsel
ves.... “Forwa
"rd, with God’s"
 aid!”  “H
urrah-ah-ah!” 
reverberated in 
"the forest, and "
the Cossack comp
"anies,
trailing"
 their lances an
d advancing one 
after another as
 if poured out 
"of a sack, dashe"
d gaily across t
he brook toward 
the camp.  One
" desperate, frig"
htened yell from
 the first Frenc
h soldier who sa
"w the
Cossacks,"
 and all who wer
"e in the camp, u"
ndressed and onl
y just waking u
"p, ran off in al"
"l directions, ab"
andoning cannons
", muskets, and h"
orses.  Had th
e Cossacks pursu
"ed the French, w"
ithout heeding w
hat was behind a
"nd
around them,"
 they would have
 captured Murat 
and everything t
here. That was 
what the officer
s desired. But i
t was impossible
 to make the Co
ssacks budge whe
n once they had 
got booty and pr
isoners. None of
 them listened 
to orders. Fifte
en hundred priso
ners and thirty-
eight guns were 
 taken on the sp
"ot, besides stan"
dards and (what 
seemed most impo
rtant to the Co
"ssacks) horses, "
"saddles, horsecl"
"oths, and the li"
ke. All this had
 to be dealt wi
"th, the prisoner"
s and guns secur
"ed, the booty di"
vided—not wit
hout some shouti
ng and even a li
ttle fighting am
ong themselves�
�and it was on 
this that the Co
ssacks all busie
d themselves.  
"
The French, not"
 being farther p
"ursued, began to"
 recover themsel
ves: they forme
d into detachmen
ts and began fir
ing. Orlóv-Den�
"�sov, still wait"
ing for the oth
er columns to ar
"rive, advanced n"
o further.  Me
"antime, accordin"
g to the disposi
tions which said
 that “the Fir
st Column will 
march” and so 
"on, the infantry"
 of the belated 
"columns,
comman"
ded by Bennigsen
 and directed by
" Toll, had start"
ed in due order 
"
and, as always "
"happens, had got"
" somewhere, but "
not to their app
ointed places. 
As always happen
"s the men, start"
"ing cheerfully, "
began to halt; 
murmurs were hea
"rd, there was a "
sense of confusi
"on, and finally "
a backward move
ment. Adjutants 
and generals gal
"loped about, sho"
"uted, grew
angr"
"y, quarreled, sa"
id they had come
 quite wrong and
" were late, gave"
 vent to a litt
"le abuse, and at"
 last gave it al
l up and went fo
"rward,
simply t"
o get somewhere.
 “We shall get
 somewhere or ot
her!” And they
 did indeed get
" somewhere, thou"
gh not to their 
right places; a 
few eventually 
even got to thei
"r right place, b"
ut too late to b
e of any use and
 only in time t
o be fired at. T
"oll, who in this"
 battle played t
he part of Weyr
other at Austerl
"itz, galloped as"
siduously from p
"lace to place,
"
finding everythi
ng upside down e
verywhere. Thus 
he stumbled on B
agovút’s cor
ps in a wood whe
n it was already
" broad daylight,"
 though the corp
s should long b
efore have joine
d Orlóv-Deníso
v. Excited and v
exed by the fai
lure and supposi
ng that someone 
must be responsi
"ble for it, Toll"
 galloped up to
 the commander o
f the corps and 
began upbraiding
" him
severely, "
saying that he o
ught to be shot.
 General Bagovú
"t, a fighting
o"
ld soldier of pl
acid temperament
", being also ups"
et by all the de
"lay,
confusion,"
 and cross-purpo
"ses, fell into a"
 rage to everybo
dy’s surprise 
 and quite contr
ary to his usual
 character and s
aid disagreeable
 things to Toll
.  “I prefer
 not to take les
sons from anyone
", but I can die "
with my men as 
"well as anybody,"
"” he said, and"
 advanced with a
 single division
.  Coming out 
onto a field und
er the enemy’s
" fire, this brav"
e general went 
"straight ahead, "
leading his men 
"under fire, with"
out considering 
in his agitatio
n whether going 
"into action now,"
 with a single d
"ivision, would
"
be of any use or
" no. Danger, can"
"non balls, and b"
ullets were just
 what he needed
 in his angry mo
od. One of the f
irst bullets kil
"led him, and oth"
er bullets kill
ed many of his m
en. And his divi
sion remained un
der fire for so
me time quite us
elessly.    
  CHAPTER VII 
  Meanwhile ano
ther column was 
to have attacked
 the French from
" the front,
but"
 Kutúzov accomp
anied that colum
n. He well knew 
that nothing but
 confusion woul
d come of this b
attle undertaken
 against his wil
"l, and as
far a"
s was in his pow
er held the troo
ps back. He did 
not advance.  
He rode silently
 on his small gr
"ay horse, indole"
ntly answering 
suggestions that
 they should att
ack.  “The w
ord attack is al
ways on your ton
"gue, but you don"
’t see that we
 are unable to 
execute complica
"ted maneuvers,�"
� said he to Mil
orádovich who 
asked permission
 to advance.  
“We couldn’t
 take Murat pris
oner this mornin
g or get to the 
"place in
time, "
and nothing can 
be done now!” 
he replied to so
meone else.  W
hen Kutúzov was
 informed that a
t the French rea
r—where accord
ing to the repo
rts of the Cossa
cks there had pr
eviously been no
body—there wer
e now two batta
"lions of Poles, "
he gave a sidelo
ng glance at Erm
ólov who was b
ehind him and to
 whom he had not
 spoken since th
e previous day. 
  “You see! T
hey are asking t
o attack and mak
ing plans of all
" kinds,
but as "
soon as one gets
 to business not
"hing is ready, a"
"nd the enemy,
f"
"orewarned, takes"
 measures accord
ingly.”  Erm
ólov screwed up
 his eyes and sm
iled faintly on 
hearing these wo
rds. He underst
ood that for him
 the storm had b
"lown over, and t"
hat Kutúzov wo
uld content hims
elf with that hi
nt.  “He’s
 having a little
 fun at my expen
"se,” said Erm�"
"�lov softly, nud"
ging with his k
nee Raévski who
 was at his side
.  Soon after 
"this, Ermólov m"
oved up to Kutú
zov and respectf
ully remarked: 
 “It is not t
"oo late yet, you"
r Highness—the
 enemy has not g
one away—if y
ou were to order
 an attack! If n
"ot, the Guards w"
ill not so much 
as see a little
 smoke.”  Ku
túzov did not r
"eply, but when t"
hey reported to 
him that Murat�
�s troops were 
in retreat he or
dered an advance
", though at ever"
y hundred paces 
he halted for t
hree quarters of
 an hour.  The
 whole battle co
nsisted in what 
Orlóv-Denísov�
��s Cossacks had
 done: the rest
 of the army mer
ely lost some hu
ndreds of men us
elessly.  In c
onsequence of th
is battle Kutúz
ov received a di
amond decoration
",
and Bennigsen"
 some diamonds a
nd a hundred tho
"usand rubles, ot"
hers also recei
ved pleasant rec
ognitions corres
ponding to their
" various grades,"
 and following 
the battle fresh
 changes were ma
de in the staff.
  “That’s 
how everything i
"s done with us, "
all topsy-turvy!
” said the Ru
ssian officers a
nd generals afte
r the Tarútino 
"battle, letting "
it be understoo
d that some fool
 there is doing 
things all wrong
 but that we ou
rselves should n
"ot have done so,"
 just as people 
speak today. But
 people who tal
k like that eith
er do not know w
hat they are tal
king about or d
eliberately dece
ive themselves. 
No battle—Tar�
"�tino, Borodinó"
", or
Austerlitz"
—takes place a
s those who plan
ned it anticipat
ed. That is an 
essential condit
ion.  A countl
ess number of fr
ee forces (for n
owhere is man fr
eer than during 
"
a battle, where"
 it is a questio
n of life and de
ath) influence t
he course taken
" by the fight, a"
nd that course n
ever can be know
n in advance and
 never coincide
s with the direc
tion of any one 
force.  If man
y simultaneously
 and variously d
irected forces a
ct on a given b
"ody, the directi"
on of its motion
 cannot coincide
 with any one of
" those
forces, "
but will always 
be a mean—what
 in mechanics is
 represented by 
 the diagonal of
 a parallelogram
 of forces.  I
f in the descrip
tions given by h
"istorians, espec"
ially French one
"s, we
find thei"
r wars and battl
es carried out i
n accordance wit
h previously fo
"rmed plans, the "
only conclusion 
to be drawn is t
hat those descri
ptions are fals
e.  The battle
 of Tarútino ob
viously did not 
attain the aim T
oll had in view
—to lead the t
roops into actio
n in the order p
rescribed by the
 dispositions; 
nor that which C
ount Orlóv-Den�
�sov may have ha
d in view—to 
take Murat priso
ner; nor the res
ult of immediate
ly destroying th
"e whole
corps, "
which Bennigsen 
and others may h
ave had in view;
 nor the aim of 
 the officer who
 wished to go in
to action to dis
tinguish himself
; nor that of t
he Cossack who w
anted more booty
" than he got, an"
d so on. But if
 the aim of the 
battle was what 
actually resulte
d and what all t
he Russians of 
that day desired
—to drive the 
French out of Ru
ssia and destro
y their army—i
t is quite clear
 that the battle
" of Tarútino, j"
ust because of 
its incongruitie
"s, was exactly w"
hat was wanted a
t that stage of
 the campaign. I
t would be diffi
cult and even im
possible to imag
ine any result 
more opportune t
han the actual o
utcome of this b
attle. With a m
inimum of effort
 and insignifica
"nt losses, despi"
te the greatest 
"
confusion, the "
most important r
esults of the wh
ole campaign wer
e attained: the
 transition from
 retreat to adva
"nce, an exposure"
 of the weaknes
"s of the French,"
 and the adminis
tration of that 
shock which Nap
oleon’s army h
ad only awaited 
to begin its fli
ght.      
CHAPTER VIII  
Napoleon enters 
Moscow after the
 brilliant victo
ry de la Moskowa
; there can be 
no doubt about t
he victory for t
he battlefield r
emains in the h
ands of the Fren
ch. The Russians
 retreat and aba
ndon their ancie
nt capital. Mos
"cow, abounding i"
"n provisions, ar"
"ms, munitions, a"
nd incalculable
" wealth, is in N"
apoleon’s hand
s. The Russian a
"rmy, only half
"
the strength of 
"the French, does"
 not make a sing
le attempt to at
tack for a whol
e month. Napoleo
n’s position i
s most brilliant
. He can either 
fall on the Rus
sian army with d
ouble its streng
th and destroy i
t; negotiate an
 advantageous pe
"ace, or in case "
of a refusal mak
e a menacing mov
e on Petersburg
", or even, in th"
e case of a reve
"rse, return to S"
molénsk or Ví
lna; or remain i
n Moscow; in sho
"rt, no special g"
enius would seem
 to be required
 to retain the b
rilliant positio
n the French hel
d at that time. 
"
For that, only "
very simple and 
easy steps were 
necessary: not t
o allow the tro
"ops to loot, to "
prepare winter c
lothing—of whi
ch there was su
fficient in Mosc
ow for the whole
 army—and meth
odically to coll
ect the provisi
"ons, of which (a"
ccording to the 
French historian
s) there were e
nough in Moscow 
to supply the wh
ole army for six
 months. Yet Nap
"oleon,
that gre"
atest of all gen
"iuses, who the h"
istorians declar
e had control of
"
the army, took"
 none of these s
teps.  He not 
merely did nothi
"ng of the kind, "
but on the contr
ary he used his 
 power to select
 the most foolis
h and ruinous of
 all the courses
 open to him. O
f all that Napol
eon might have d
one: wintering i
"n Moscow,
advan"
cing on Petersbu
rg or on Nízhni
"-Nóvgorod, or r"
etiring by a mor
e northerly or 
more southerly r
oute (say by the
 road Kutúzov a
fterwards took)
", nothing more s"
tupid or disastr
ous can be imagi
ned than what he
 actually did. 
He remained in M
oscow till Octob
"er, letting the "
troops plunder 
"the city; then, "
hesitating wheth
er to leave a ga
rrison behind h
"im, he quitted M"
"oscow, approache"
d Kutúzov witho
ut joining battl
"e,
turned to th"
e right and reac
hed Málo-Yarosl
"ávets, again wi"
thout attemptin
g to break throu
gh and take the 
road Kutúzov to
"ok, but retiring"
 instead to Moz
háysk along the
 devastated Smol
énsk road. Noth
ing more stupid
 than that could
 have been devis
"ed, or more disa"
strous for the 
"army, as the seq"
uel showed. Had 
Napoleon’s aim
 been to destroy
" his army,
the "
most skillful st
rategist could h
ardly have devis
ed any series o
f actions that w
ould so complete
ly have accompli
shed that purpos
"e,
independentl"
y of anything th
e Russian army m
ight do.  Napo
"leon, the man of"
" genius, did thi"
s! But to say th
at he destroyed 
his army becaus
"e he wished to, "
or because he wa
"s very stupid, w"
ould be as unju
st as to say tha
t he had brought
 his troops to M
oscow because he
 wished to and 
because he was v
ery clever and a
 genius.  In b
oth cases his pe
"rsonal activity,"
 having no more 
force than the 
personal activit
y of any soldier
", merely coincid"
ed with the laws
 that guided th
e event.  The 
historians quite
 falsely represe
nt Napoleon’s 
faculties as hav
ing weakened in
" Moscow, and do "
so only because 
the results did 
not justify his
 actions. He emp
loyed all his ab
ility and streng
th to do the bes
t he could for 
himself and his 
"army, as he had "
done previously 
and as he did s
ubsequently in 1
813. His activit
y at that time w
as no less astou
nding than it w
"as in Egypt, in "
"Italy, in Austri"
"a, and in Prussi"
a. We do not kn
ow for certain i
n how far his ge
nius was genuine
 in Egypt—wher
e forty centuri
es looked down u
pon his grandeur
—for his great
 exploits there 
are all told us
 by Frenchmen. W
e cannot accurat
ely estimate his
 genius in Aust
"ria or Prussia, "
for we have to d
raw our informat
ion from French 
 or German sourc
"es, and the inco"
mprehensible sur
render of whole 
corps without f
ighting and of f
ortresses withou
t a siege must i
ncline Germans 
to recognize his
 genius as the o
nly explanation 
of the war carri
ed on in German
"y. But we, thank"
" God, have no ne"
ed to recognize 
his genius in o
rder to hide our
 shame. We have 
paid for the rig
ht to look at th
e matter plainl
"y and simply, an"
d we will not ab
andon that right
.  His activit
y in Moscow was 
as amazing and a
s full of genius
 as elsewhere. 
Order after orde
r and plan after
 plan were issue
d by him from t
he time he enter
ed Moscow till t
he time he left 
it. The absence 
 of citizens and
 of a deputation
", and even the b"
urning of Moscow
", did not
disco"
ncert him. He di
d not lose sight
 either of the w
elfare of his a
rmy or of the do
ings of the enem
"y, or of the wel"
fare of the peop
"le
of Russia, o"
r of the directi
on of affairs in
" Paris, or of di"
plomatic consid
erations concern
ing the terms of
 the anticipated
 peace.     
  CHAPTER IX  
 With regard to 
military matters
", Napoleon immed"
iately on his en
try into Moscow
 gave General Sa
bastiani strict 
orders to observ
e the movements 
 of the Russian 
"army, sent army "
corps out along 
the different ro
"ads, and
charge"
d Murat to find 
Kutúzov. Then h
e gave careful d
irections about 
the fortificati
on of the Kréml
"in, and drew up "
a brilliant plan
 for a future c
ampaign over the
 whole map of Ru
ssia.  With re
gard to diplomat
"ic questions, Na"
poleon summoned 
Captain Yákovle
"v,
who had been"
 robbed and was 
in rags and did 
not know how to 
get out of Mosc
"ow, minutely exp"
lained to him hi
s whole policy a
nd his magnanimi
"ty,
and having "
written a letter
 to the Emperor 
Alexander in whi
ch he considere
d it his duty to
 inform his Frie
nd and Brother t
hat Rostopchín 
 had managed aff
airs badly in Mo
"scow, he dispatc"
hed Yákovlev to
 Petersburg.  
 Having similarl
y explained his 
views and his ma
gnanimity to Tut
"ólmin, he
disp"
atched that old 
man also to Pete
rsburg to negoti
ate.  With reg
ard to legal mat
"ters, immediatel"
y after the fire
s he gave orders
 to find and ex
ecute the incend
iaries. And the 
scoundrel Rostop
chín was punis
hed by an order 
to burn down his
 houses.  With
 regard to admin
istrative matter
"s, Moscow was gr"
anted a constit
ution. A municip
ality was establ
ished and the fo
llowing announc
ement issued:  
  INHABITANTS O
F MOSCOW!  You
r misfortunes ar
"e cruel, but His"
 Majesty the Emp
eror and King d
esires to arrest
 their course. T
errible examples
 have taught you
 how he punishe
s disobedience a
nd crime. Strict
 measures have b
een taken to pu
t an end to diso
rder and to re-e
stablish public 
security. A pat
ernal administra
"tion, chosen fro"
m among yourselv
"es, will form yo"
ur municipality
 or city governm
ent. It will tak
"e care of you, o"
"f your
needs, a"
nd of your welfa
re. Its members 
will be distingu
ished by a red 
ribbon worn acro
"ss the shoulder,"
 and the mayor o
f the city will 
wear a white be
lt as well. But 
when not on duty
 they will only 
wear a red ribb
on round the lef
t arm.  The ci
ty police is est
ablished on its 
"former footing, "
and better order
 already prevai
ls in consequenc
e of its activit
y. The governmen
t has appointed
 two commissarie
"s general, or ch"
"iefs of police, "
and twenty comm
issaries or capt
ains of wards ha
ve been appointe
d to the differe
nt wards of the
 city. You will 
recognize them b
y the white ribb
on they will we
ar on the left a

ches of differen

"are
open, and d"
ivine service is
 performed in th

our fellow citi
zens are returni
ng every day to 
their homes and 
orders have been
 given that the
y should find in
 them the help a

ortunes. These a
re the measures 
the government h
as adopted to r
e-establish orde
r and relieve yo
ur condition. Bu
t to achieve thi
s aim it is nec
essary that you 
should add your 
efforts and shou
"ld, if
possible"

"e suffered, shou"
ld entertain th
e hope of a less
" cruel fate, sho"
uld be certain t
hat inevitable a
nd ignominious 
death awaits tho
se who make any 
attempt on your 
persons or on w
hat remains of y
"our property, an"
d finally that y
ou should not do
ubt that these 
will be safeguar
"ded, since such "
is the will of t
he greatest and
 most just of mo
narchs. Soldiers
" and citizens, o"
f whatever natio

may be, r"
e-establish publ
"ic confidence, t"

 welfare of a s
"tate, live like "
"brothers, render"

protection one t
"o
another, unit"
e to defeat the 
intentions of th
"e evil-minded, o"
bey the militar
y and civil auth
"orities, and you"
r tears will soo
n cease to flow!
   With regar
d to supplies fo
"r the army, Napo"
leon decreed tha
t all the troop
s in turn should
 enter Moscow à
 la maraude * to
 obtain provisio
ns for themselv
"es, so that the "
army might have 
its future provi
ded for.      
* As looters.  
 With regard to 
"religion, Napole"
on ordered the p
riests to be bro
ught back and s
ervices to be ag
ain performed in
 the churches. 
 With regard to
 commerce and to
 provisioning th

owing was placa

t has taken the 
following steps 
to ensure freedo

"usbandmen, and t"

Similar measures
 will be taken 
that peasants wi

5) Steps will im

 Lay your respec

   With the o
bject of raising
 the spirits of 
the troops and o
"f the people,
r"
eviews were cons
tantly held and 
rewards distribu
ted. The Emperor
 rode through t
he streets to co
mfort the inhabi
"tants, and, desp"
ite his preoccu
pation with stat
"e affairs, himse"
lf visited the t
heaters that wer
e established b
y his order.  
In regard to phi
"lanthropy, the g"
reatest virtue o
"f crowned heads,"
 Napoleon also 
did all in his p
ower. He caused 
the words Maison
 de ma Mère to
 be inscribed on
 the charitable 
"institutions, th"
ereby combining 
 tender filial a
ffection with th
e majestic benev
olence of a mona
rch. He visited
 the Foundling H
"ospital and, all"
owing the orphan
s saved by him 
to kiss his whit
"e hands, graciou"
sly conversed wi
th Tutólmin. Th
"en, as
Thiers e"
loquently recoun
"ts, he ordered h"
is soldiers to b
e paid in forged
 Russian money 
which he had pre
pared: “Raisin
g the use of the
se means by an 
act worthy of hi
mself and of the
" French army, he"
 let relief be 
distributed to t
hose who had bee
n burned out. Bu
t as food was to
o precious to b
e given to forei

"t enemies,
Napo"
leon preferred t
o supply them wi
th money with wh
ich to purchase 
food from outsi
"de, and had pape"
r rubles distrib

  With referen
ce to army disci
"pline, orders we"
re continually b
eing issued to 
inflict severe p
unishment for th
e nonperformance
 of military dut
ies and to supp

     CHAPTER
 X  But strang
"e to say, all th"
"ese measures, ef"
"forts, and plans"
—which were n
ot at all worse 
than others issu
ed in similar ci
rcumstances—di
d not affect th
e essence of the
" matter but, lik"
e the hands of a

 from the mechan

 in an arbitrary
 and aimless way
 without engagi

.  With refere

lan of campaign�
��that work of 
genius of which 
Thiers remarks t
"hat, “His geni"
us never devised
 anything more 
"profound, more s"
"killful, or more"
" admirable,” a"
nd enters into a
 polemic with M
. Fain to prove 
that this work o
f genius must be
 referred not t
o the fourth but
 to the fifteent
h of October—t
hat plan never w
as or could be 
"executed, for it"
 was quite out o

 facts of the c

"lin, for which l"
a Mosquée (as N
apoleon termed 
the church of Ba
sil the Beatifie
d) was to have b
een razed to th
"e ground, proved"
 quite useless. 
The mining of th
e Krémlin only 
helped toward f
ulfilling Napole
on’s wish that
 it should be bl
own up when he 
left Moscow—as
 a child wants t
he floor on whic

d-of result. The
 French generals
 lost touch wit
h the Russian ar
my of sixty thou
"sand men, and ac"
cording to Thier
s it was only e
"ventually found,"
 like a lost pin
", by the skill�"
�and apparently 
 the genius—of
 Murat.  With 
reference to dip
"lomacy, all Napo"
leon’s argumen

gnanimity and ju
"stice, both to T"
utólmin and to 
Yákovlev (whose
 chief concern 
was to obtain a 
greatcoat and a 
"conveyance), pro"
ved useless; Al
exander did not 
receive these en
voys and did not
 reply to their 
 embassage.  W
ith regard to le
"gal matters, aft"

w burned down. 
 With regard to
 administrative 
"matters, the est"
ablishment of a 
 municipality di
d not stop the r
obberies and was
 only of use to 
certain people 
who formed part 
of that municipa
lity and under p
retext of prese
rving order loot
ed Moscow or sav
ed their own pro
perty from being
 looted.  Wit
h regard to reli
"gion, as to whic"
h in Egypt matte
rs had so easily
 been settled b
y Napoleon’s v
isit to a mosque
", no results wer"
e achieved. Two
 or three priest
s who were found
 in Moscow did t
ry to carry out 
 Napoleon’s wi
"sh, but one of t"
hem was slapped 
in the face by a
 French soldier
 while conductin
"g service, and a"
 French official
 reported of an
other that: “T
he priest whom I
 found and invit
ed to say Mass c
leaned and lock
ed up the church
. That night the
 doors were agai
"n broken
open, "
the padlocks sma
"shed, the books "
"mutilated, and o"
ther disorders 
perpetrated.” 
  With referenc
"e to commerce, t"
he proclamation 
to industrious w
orkmen and to p
easants evoked n
o response. Ther
e were no indust
"rious workmen, a"
nd the peasants
 caught the comm
issaries who ven
tured too far ou
t of town with 
the proclamation
 and killed them
.  As to the t
heaters for the 
entertainment of
 the people and 
"the troops,
the"
se did not meet 
with success eit
her. The theater
s set up in the 
 Krémlin and in
 Posnyákov’s 
house were close
d again at once 
because the act
ors and actresse
s were robbed. 
 Even philanthr
opy did not have
 the desired eff
ect. The genuine
 as well as the
 false paper mon
ey which flooded
 Moscow lost its
 value. The Fre
"nch, collecting "
"booty, cared onl"
y for gold. Not 
only was the pa
per money valuel
ess which Napole
on so graciously
 distributed to 
the unfortunate
", but even silve"
r lost its value
 in relation to 
gold.  But the
 most amazing ex
ample of the ine
ffectiveness of 
the orders given
 by the authori
ties at that tim
e was Napoleon�
�s attempt to st
op the looting 
and re-establish
 discipline.  
This is what the
 army authoritie
s were reporting
:  “Looting 
continues in the
 city despite th
e decrees agains
t it. Order is 
not yet restored
 and not a singl
e merchant is ca
rrying on trade 
in a lawful man
ner. The sutlers
 alone venture t
"o trade, and the"
y sell stolen g
oods.”  “T
he neighborhood 
of my ward conti
nues to be pilla
ged by soldiers 
of the 3rd Corp
"s who, not satis"
fied with taking
 from the unfort
unate inhabitan
ts hiding in the
 cellars the lit
tle they have le
"ft, even have
t"
he ferocity to w
ound them with t
"heir sabers, as "
I have repeatedl
y witnessed.”
  “Nothing n
"ew, except that "
the soldiers are
 robbing and pil
laging—October
 9.”  “Ro
bbery and pillag
ing continue. Th
ere is a band of
 thieves in our 
 district who ou
ght to be arrest

orce—October 1
1.”  “The 
Emperor is extre
mely displeased 
that despite the
 strict orders t
"o
stop pillage,"
 parties of mara
uding Guards are
 continually see
n returning to 
the Krémlin. Am
ong the Old Guar
d disorder and p
illage were rene
wed more violen
tly than ever ye
"sterday evening,"
" last night, and"
 today. The Emp
eror sees with r
egret that the p

ppointed to guar

person, w"
ho should set an
 example of disc
"ipline, carry di"
sobedience to s

 stores containi
ng army supplie
s. Others have d
isgraced themsel
ves to the exten
t of disobeying 
 sentinels and o
"fficers, and hav"
e abused and bea
ten them.”  
“The Grand Mar
shal of the pala
"ce,” wrote the"
" governor, “co"
mplains bitterl
y that in spite 
of repeated orde
"rs, the soldiers"
 continue to co
mmit nuisances i
n all the courty
ards and even un
der the very win
dows of the Emp
eror.”  That
" army, like a he"
rd of cattle run
 wild and trampl
ing underfoot th
e provender whi
ch might have sa
ved it from star
"vation, disinteg"
rated and peris
hed with each ad
ditional day it 
remained in Mosc
ow. But it did n
ot go away.  
It began to run 
away only when s
uddenly seized b
y a panic caused
 by the capture
 of transport tr
ains on the Smol
"énsk road, and "
by the battle of
 Tarútino. The
 news of that ba
ttle of Tarútin
"o, unexpectedly "
received by Nap
oleon at a revie
"w, evoked in him"
 a desire to pun
ish the Russians
"
(Thiers says),"
 and he issued t
he order for dep
arture which the
 whole army was
 demanding.  F
leeing from Mosc
ow the soldiers 
took with them e
verything they h
ad stolen. Napo
"leon, too, carri"
ed away his own 
personal trésor
", but on
seeing"
 the baggage tra
ins that impeded
" the army, he wa"
s (Thiers says) 
 horror-struck. 
And yet with his
 experience of w
ar he did not or
der all the sup
erfluous vehicle
"s to be burned, "
as he had done w
ith those of a 
certain marshal 
when approaching
 Moscow. He gaze
d at the calèch
es and carriage
s in which soldi
ers were riding 
and remarked tha
t it was a very 
"
good thing, as "
those vehicles c
ould be used to 
carry provisions
", the
sick, and"
 the wounded.  
 The plight of t
he whole army re
sembled that of 
a wounded animal
 which feels it
 is perishing an
d does not know 
what it is doing
. To study the 
skillful tactics
 and aims of Nap
oleon and his ar
my from the time
 it entered Mos
cow till it was 
destroyed is lik
e studying the d
ying leaps and 
shudders of a mo
rtally wounded a
nimal. Very ofte
n a wounded anim
"al,
hearing a r"
"ustle, rushes st"
raight at the hu
"nter’s gun, ru"
ns forward and 
"back again, and "
hastens its own 
"end. Napoleon, u"
nder pressure fr
om his whole ar
"my, did the same"
 thing. The rust
le of the battle
 of Tarútino f
rightened the be
"ast, and it rush"
ed forward onto 
the hunter’s g
"un,
reached him"
", turned back, a"
nd finally—lik
e any wild beast
—ran back alon
g the most disa
dvantageous and 
"dangerous path, "
where the old sc
ent was familia
r.  During the
 whole of that p
"eriod Napoleon, "
who seems to us 
to have been th
e leader of all 
these movements�
��as the figureh
ead of a ship ma
y seem to a sav
age to guide the
 vessel—acted 
like a child who
", holding a coup"
le of strings i
nside a carriage
", thinks he is d"
riving it.   
   CHAPTER XI
  Early in the
 morning of the 
sixth of October
 Pierre went out
" of the
shed, a"
nd on returning 
stopped by the d
oor to play with
 a little blue-
"gray dog, with a"
 long body and s
"hort bandy legs,"
 that jumped abo
ut him. This li
ttle dog lived i
"n their shed, sl"
eeping beside Ka
ratáev at nigh
t; it sometimes 
made excursions 
into the town bu
t always returne
d again. Probab
ly it had never 
"had an owner, an"
d it still belon
ged to nobody a
nd had no name. 
The French calle
d it Azor; the s
oldier who told
 stories called 
it Femgálka; Ka
ratáev and othe
rs called it Gra
"y, or
sometimes"
 Flabby. Its lac
"k of a master, a"
" name, or even o"
f a breed or an
y definite color
 did not seem to
 trouble the blu
e-gray dog in th
e least. Its fu
rry tail stood u
p firm and round
" as a plume, its"
 bandy legs ser
ved it so well t
hat it would oft
en gracefully li
ft a hind leg an
d run very easi
ly and quickly o
"n three legs, as"
 if disdaining t
o use all four.
 Everything plea
sed it. Now it w
ould roll on its
" back, yelping w"
"ith
delight, no"
w bask in the su
n with a thought
ful air of impor
"tance, and
now "
frolic about pla
ying with a chip
 of wood or a st
raw.  Pierre�
�s attire by now
 consisted of a 
dirty torn shirt
 (the only remn
ant of his forme
"r clothing), a p"
air of soldier�
�s trousers whic
h by Karatáev�
��s advice he ti
ed with string r
ound the ankles 
"for warmth, and"
 a peasant coat 
and cap. Physica
lly he had chang
ed much during t
his time. He no
 longer seemed s
"tout, though he "
still had the ap
pearance of sol
idity and streng
th hereditary in
 his family. A b
eard and mustach
e covered the l
ower part of his
" face, and a tan"
"gle of hair, inf"
ested with lice
", curled round h"
is head like a c
ap. The look of 
his eyes was re
"solute, calm, an"
d animatedly ale
"rt, as never bef"
ore. The former 
 slackness which
 had shown itsel
f even in his ey
es was now repla
ced by an energ
etic readiness f
or action and re
sistance. His fe
et were bare.  
 Pierre first lo
oked down the fi
eld across which
 vehicles and ho
rsemen were pas
sing that mornin
"g, then into the"
 distance across
" the river, then"
 at the dog who
 was pretending 
to be in earnest
 about biting hi
"m,
and then at "
his bare feet wh
ich he placed wi
th pleasure in v
arious position
"s, moving his di"
rty thick big to
es. Every time h
e looked at his 
 bare feet a smi
le of animated s
elf-satisfaction
 flitted across 
his face. The s
ight of them rem
inded him of all
 he had experien
ced and learned 
 during these we
eks and this rec
ollection was pl
easant to him. 
 For some days 
the weather had 
been calm and cl
ear with slight 
frosts in the m
ornings—what i
s called an “o
ld wives’ summ
er.”  In the
 sunshine the ai
"r was warm, and "
that warmth was 
particularly pl
easant with the 
invigorating fre
shness of the mo
rning frost stil
l in the air. 
 On everything�
��far and near�
�lay the magic c
rystal glitter s
een only at tha
t time of autumn
. The Sparrow Hi
lls were visible
 in the distance
",
with the vill"
"age, the church,"
 and the large w
hite house. The 
"bare trees,
the"
" sand, the brick"
s and roofs of t
"he houses, the g"
reen church spir
"e,
and the corn"
ers of the white
 house in the di
"stance, all stoo"
d out in the tr
ansparent air in
 most delicate o
utline and with 
unnatural clearn
ess. Near by co
uld be seen the 
familiar ruins o
f a half-burned 
mansion occupie
"d by the French,"
 with lilac bush
es still showing
 dark green bes
ide the fence. A
nd even that rui
ned and befouled
 house—which i
n dull weather 
was repulsively 
ugly—seemed qu
ietly beautiful 
"now, in the clea"
"r,
motionless b"
rilliance.  A 
"French corporal,"
 with coat unbut
toned in a homel
"y way, a skullca"
"p on
his head, "
and a short pipe
" in his mouth, c"
ame from behind 
a corner of the
 shed and approa
ched Pierre with
 a friendly wink
.  “What sun
"shine, Monsieur "
Kiril!” (Their
 name for Pierre
.) “Eh? Just l
ike spring!” 
  And the corpo
ral leaned again
st the door and 
offered Pierre h
"is pipe,
though"
 whenever he off
ered it Pierre a
lways declined i
t.  “To be o
n the march in s
uch weather...�
� he began.  P
ierre inquired w
hat was being sa
id about leaving
", and the corpor"
al told him tha
t nearly all the
 troops were sta
rting and there 
ought to be an 
order about the 
prisoners that d
"ay. Sokolóv, on"
e of the soldier
s in the shed w
"ith Pierre, was "
"dying, and Pierr"
e told the corpo
ral that somethi
ng should be do
ne about him. Th
e corporal repli
ed that Pierre n
eed not worry a
bout that as the
y had an ambulan
ce and a permane
nt hospital and 
 arrangements wo
uld be made for 
"the sick, and th"
at in general ev
erything that c
ould happen had 
been foreseen by
 the authorities
".

“Besides,"
" Monsieur Kiril,"
 you have only t
o say a word to 
"the captain,
yo"
u know. He is a 
man who never fo
rgets anything. 
Speak to the cap
tain when he ma
"kes his round, h"
e will do anythi
ng for you.” 
 (The captain o
f whom the corpo
ral spoke often 
had long chats w
ith Pierre and 
showed him all s
orts of favors.)
  “‘You se
"e, St. Thomas,�"
� he said to me 
the other day. �
��Monsieur Kiril
 is a man of ed
"ucation, who spe"
aks French. He i
s a Russian seig
neur who has ha
"d misfortunes, b"
ut he is a man. 
He knows what’
s what.... If he
 wants anything
" and asks me, he"
 won’t get a r
efusal. When one
" has studied, yo"
"u
see, one like"
s education and 
well-bred people
.’ It is for y
our sake I ment
"ion it, Monsieur"
 Kiril. The othe
r day if it had 
not been for you
 that affair wo
uld have ended i
ll.”  And af
ter chatting a w
"hile longer, the"
 corporal went a
way. (The affair
 he had alluded
 to had happened
 a few days befo
re—a fight bet
ween the prison
ers and the Fren
"ch soldiers, in "
which Pierre had
 succeeded in p
acifying his com
rades.) Some of 
the prisoners wh
o had heard Pier
re talking to t
he corporal imme
diately asked wh
at the Frenchman
 had said. Whil
e Pierre was rep
eating what he h
ad been told abo
ut the army leav
"ing
Moscow, a t"
"hin, sallow, tat"
tered French sol
dier came up to 
the door of the
 shed. Rapidly a
nd timidly raisi
ng his fingers t
o his forehead b
y way of greeti
"ng, he asked Pie"
rre whether the 
soldier Platoche
 to whom he had 
 given a shirt t
o sew was in tha
t shed.  A wee
k before the Fre
nch had had boot
 leather and lin
en issued to the
"m,
which they h"
ad given out to 
the prisoners to
 make up into bo
ots and shirts 
for them.  “
"Ready, ready, de"
ar fellow!” sa
"id Karatáev, co"
ming out with a 
neatly folded s
hirt.  Karatá
"ev, on account o"
f the warm weath
er and for conve
"nience at work,"
 was wearing onl
y trousers and a
 tattered shirt 
as black as soot
. His hair was 
"bound round, wor"
"kman fashion, wi"
th a wisp of lim
"e-tree bast,
an"
d his round face
 seemed rounder 
and pleasanter t
han ever.  “
A promise is own
 brother to perf
ormance! I said 
Friday and here 
"it is,
ready,�"
"� said Platón, "
smiling and unfo
lding the shirt 
he had sewn.  
The Frenchman gl
anced around une
"asily and then, "
as if overcoming
 his hesitation
", rapidly threw "
off his uniform 
and put on the s
hirt. He had a 
"long, greasy, fl"
owered silk wais
tcoat next to hi
"s sallow, thin b"
"are
body, but n"
o shirt. He was 
evidently afraid
 the prisoners l
ooking on would
" laugh at him, a"
nd thrust his he
ad into the shir
t hurriedly. Non
e of the prison
ers said a word.
"

“See, it f"
its well!” Pla
tón kept repeat
"ing, pulling the"
 shirt straight.
  The Frenchma
"n, having pushed"
 his head and ha
"nds through, wit"
hout raising hi
"s eyes, looked d"
own at the shirt
 and examined th
e seams.  “Y
"ou see, dear man"
", this is not a "
"sewing shop, and"
 I had no proper
"
tools; and, as"
" they say, one n"
eeds a tool even
 to kill a louse
",” said
Plat�"
�n with one of h
"is round smiles,"
 obviously pleas
ed with his work
.  “It’s g
"ood, quite good,"
" thank you,” s"
aid the Frenchma
"n, in French, �"
�but there must
 be some linen l
eft over.”  
“It will fit b
etter still when
 it sets to your
" body,” said K"
"aratáev,
still"
 admiring his ha
ndiwork. “You�
��ll be nice and
 comfortable....
”  “Thanks
", thanks, old fe"
llow.... But the
 bits left over?
” said the Fr
enchman again an
d smiled. He too
k out an assigna
tion ruble note 
and gave it to 
Karatáev. “Bu
t give me the pi
eces that are ov
er.”  Pierre
 saw that Plató
n did not want t
o understand wha
t the Frenchman 
"
was saying, and"
 he looked on wi
thout interferin
g. Karatáev tha
nked the French
man for the mone
y and went on ad
miring his own w
ork. The Frenchm
an insisted on 
having the piece
s returned that 
were left over a
nd asked Pierre
 to translate wh
at he said.  �
��What does he w
ant the bits for
?” said Karat�
�ev. “They’d
 make fine leg 
bands for us. We
"ll, never mind.�"
��  And Karat�
"�ev, with a sudd"
enly changed and
 saddened expres
"sion, took
a sm"
all bundle of sc
raps from inside
 his shirt and g
ave it to the F
renchman without
 looking at him.
 “Oh dear!” 
muttered Karatá
ev and went awa
y. The Frenchman
 looked at the l
"inen, considered"
" for a moment, t"
hen looked inqu
iringly at Pierr
"e and, as if Pie"
rre’s look had
 told him somet
"hing, suddenly b"
lushed and shout
ed in a squeaky 
voice:  “Pla
"toche! Eh, Plato"
che! Keep them y
ourself!” And 
handing back the
 odd bits he tu
rned and went ou
"t.

“There, "
"look at that,”"
" said Karatáev,"
 swaying his hea
d. “People sai
d they were not
" Christians, but"
 they too have s
ouls. It’s wha
t the old folk 
used to say: ‘
A sweating hand�
��s an open hand
", a dry hand’s"
 close.’ He�
"�s naked, but ye"
t he’s given i
t back.”  Ka
ratáev smiled t
houghtfully and 
was silent awhil
e looking at the
 pieces.  “
But they’ll ma
ke grand leg ban
"ds, dear friend,"
"” he said, and"
 went back into
 the shed.   
   CHAPTER XI
I  Four weeks 
had passed since
 Pierre had been
 taken prisoner 
and though the 
French had offer
ed to move him f
rom the men’s 
to the officers�
"�� shed,
he had"
 stayed in the s
hed where he was
 first put.  I
n burned and dev
astated Moscow P
ierre experience
d almost the ext
reme limits of 
privation a man 
can endure; but 
thanks to his ph
ysical strength
" and health, of "
which he had til
l then been unco
"nscious, and
th"
anks especially 
to the fact that
 the privations 
came so graduall
y that it was i
mpossible to say
 when they began
", he endured his"
 position not o
nly lightly but 
joyfully. And ju
st at this time 
he obtained the 
 tranquillity an
d ease of mind h
e had formerly s
triven in vain t
o reach. He had
 long sought in 
different ways t
hat tranquillity
" of mind, that
"
inner harmony wh
ich had so impre
ssed him in the 
soldiers at the 
battle of Borod
inó. He had sou
ght it in philan
"thropy, in Freem"
"asonry, in the
"
dissipations of 
"town life, in wi"
"ne, in heroic fe"
ats of self-sacr
"ifice,
and in r"
omantic love for
 Natásha; he ha
d sought it by r
easoning—and a
ll these quests
 and experiments
 had failed him.
 And now without
 thinking about
 it he had found
 that peace and 
inner harmony on
ly through the 
"horror of death,"
 through privati
"on, and through "
what he recogniz
ed in Karatáev
.  Those dread
ful moments he h
ad lived through
 at the executio
ns had as it we
re forever washe
d away from his 
imagination and 
memory the agita
ting thoughts a
nd feelings that
 had formerly se
emed so importan
t. It did not n
ow occur to him 
to think of Russ
"ia, or the war, "
"or politics, or"
 Napoleon. It wa
s plain to him t
hat all these th
ings were no bus
"iness
of his, a"
nd that he was n
ot called on to 
judge concerning
 them and there
fore could not d
o so. “Russia 
and summer weath
er are not bound
"
together,” h"
"e thought, repea"
ting words of Ka
ratáev’s whic
h he found stra
ngely consoling.
 His intention o
f killing Napole
on and his calc
ulations of the 
cabalistic numbe
r of the beast o
f the Apocalypse
 now seemed to 
him meaningless 
and even ridicul
ous. His anger w
ith his wife an
d anxiety that h
is name should n
ot be smirched n
ow seemed not me
rely trivial bu
t even amusing. 
What concern was
 it of his that 
somewhere or ot
her that woman w
as leading the l
ife she preferre
d? What did it m
atter to anybod
"y, and especiall"
"y to him, whethe"
r or not they fo
und out that th
eir prisoner’s
 name was Count 
Bezúkhov?  He
 now often remem
bered his conver
sation with Prin
ce Andrew and qu
ite agreed with
" him, though he "
understood Princ
e Andrew’s tho
ughts somewhat 
differently. Pri
nce Andrew had t
hought and said 
that happiness c
ould only be ne
"gative, but had "
said it with a s
hade of bitterne
ss and irony as
 though he was r
eally saying tha
t all desire for
 positive happin
ess is implante
d in us merely t
o torment us and
 never be satisf
ied. But Pierre 
 believed it wit
hout any mental 
reservation. The
 absence of suff
"ering,
the sati"
sfaction of one�
��s needs and co
nsequent freedom
 in the choice o
f one’s occup
"ation, that is, "
of one’s way o
"f life, now seem"
ed to Pierre to 
 be indubitably 
man’s highest 
happiness. Here 
and now for the 
first time he f
ully appreciated
 the enjoyment o
f eating when he
" wanted to eat,"
 drinking when h
e wanted to drin
"k, sleeping when"
 he wanted to sl
"eep, of
warmth "
when he was cold
", of talking to "
a fellow man whe
n he wished to 
talk and to hear
 a human voice. 
The satisfaction
 of one’s need
"s—good
food, "
"cleanliness, and"
 freedom—now t

m such an easy m

��such freedom a

him in his own 
life—is just w
hat makes the ch
oice of occupati
on insolubly dif
ficult and dest
roys the desire 
and possibility 
of having an occ
upation.  All 
Pierre’s daydr
eams now turned 
on the time when
 he would be fre
e. Yet subseque
"ntly, and for th"
e rest of his li
"fe, he thought a"
nd spoke with e
nthusiasm of tha
t month of capti
"vity, of those i"
"rrecoverable, st"
"rong,
joyful se"
"nsations, and ch"
iefly of the com
plete peace of m
ind and inner f
reedom which he 
experienced only
 during those we
eks.  When on 
the first day he
" got up early, w"
ent out of the s
"hed at dawn, and"
 saw the cupola
s and crosses of
 the New Convent
 of the Virgin s
till dark at fi
"rst, the hoarfro"
st on the dusty 
"grass, the Sparr"
"ow Hills, and th"
e wooded banks 
above the windin
g river vanishin
g in the purple 
"distance,
when "
he felt the cont
act of the fresh
 air and heard t
he noise of the 
 crows flying fr
om Moscow across
" the field, and "
when afterwards 
light gleamed f
rom the east and
 the sun’s rim
 appeared solemn
ly from behind a
"
cloud, and the"
 cupolas and cro
"sses, the hoarfr"
"ost, the distanc"
e and the river
", all began to s"
parkle in the gl
ad light—Pierr
e felt a new joy
 and strength i
n life such as h
e had never befo
re known. And th
is not only sta
yed with him dur
ing the whole of
 his imprisonmen
"t, but even grew"
 in strength as
 the hardships o
f his position i
ncreased.  Tha
t feeling of ale
rtness and of re
adiness for anyt
hing was still 
further strength
ened in him by t
he high opinion 
his fellow priso
ners formed of 
him soon after h
is arrival at th
e shed. With his
 knowledge of l
"anguages, the re"
spect shown him 
"by the French, h"
"is simplicity, h"
is readiness to
 give anything a
sked of him (he 
received the all
owance of three
 rubles a week m
ade to officers)
; with his stren
"gth, which he
s"
howed to the sol
diers by pressin
g nails into the
 walls of the hu
t; his gentlene
ss to his compan
"ions, and his ca"
pacity for sitti
ng still and th
inking without d
oing anything (w
hich seemed to t
hem incomprehens
"ible),
he appea"
red to them a ra
ther mysterious 
and superior bei
ng. The very qu
alities that had
 been a hindranc
"e, if not actual"
"ly harmful, to h"
im in the world
 he had lived in
"—his strength,"
 his disdain for
 the comforts of
"
life, his abse"
nt-mindedness an
d simplicity—h
ere among these 
people gave him
 almost the stat
us of a hero. An
d Pierre felt th
at their opinion
 placed respons
ibilities upon h
im.      C
HAPTER XIII  T
he French evacua
tion began on th
e night between 
the sixth and se
venth of Octobe
r: kitchens and 
sheds were disma
"ntled, carts loa"
"ded, and troops"
 and baggage tra
ins started.  
At seven in the 
morning a French
 convoy in march
"ing trim, wearin"
g shakos and ca
"rrying muskets, "
"knapsacks, and e"
"normous sacks, s"
tood in front o
"f the sheds, and"
 animated French
 talk mingled wi
th curses sounde
d all along the
 lines.  In th
e shed everyone 
"was ready, dress"
"ed, belted, shod"
", and only await"
ed the order to
 start. The sick
" soldier, Sokol�"
"�v, pale and thi"
n with dark sha
dows round his e
"yes, alone sat i"
n his place bare
foot and not dre
"ssed.
His eyes,"
 prominent from 
the emaciation o
"f his face, gaze"
d inquiringly a
t his comrades w
ho were paying n
o attention to h
"im, and he moane"
d regularly and
 quietly. It was
 evidently not s
o much his suffe
rings that caus
ed him to moan (
he had dysentery
) as his fear an
d grief at being
 left alone.  
"
Pierre, girt wi"
th a rope round 
his waist and we
aring shoes Kara
táev had made 
for him from som
e leather a Fren
ch soldier had t
orn off a tea ch
est and brought
 to have his boo
"ts mended with, "
went up to the s
ick man and squ
atted down besid
e him.  “You
" know, Sokolóv,"
 they are not al
l going away! Th
ey have a hospit
al here. You ma
y be better off 
"than we others,�"
�� said Pierre. 
  “O Lord! Oh
", it will be the"
 death of me! O 
Lord!” moaned 
the man in a lo
uder voice.  �
��I’ll go and 
ask them again d
"irectly,” said"
" Pierre, rising "
and going to th
e door of the sh
ed.  Just as P
ierre reached th
"e door, the corp"
oral who had off
ered him a pipe
 the day before 
came up to it wi
th two soldiers.
 The corporal an
d soldiers were
 in marching kit
 with knapsacks 
and shakos that 
had metal strap
"s, and these cha"
nged their famil
iar faces.  Th
"e corporal came,"
 according to or
"ders, to shut th"
e door. The pris
oners had to be
 counted before 
being let out. 
"
“Corporal, w"
hat will they do
 with the sick m
an?...” Pierre
 began.  But e
ven as he spoke 
he began to doub
t whether this w
as the corporal 
 he knew or a st
"ranger, so unlik"
e himself did th
e corporal seem 
at that moment.
" Moreover, just "
as Pierre was sp
eaking a sharp r
attle of drums 
was suddenly hea
rd from both sid
es. The corporal
 frowned at Pier
re’s words an
"d, uttering some"
 meaningless oat
"hs, slammed the "
door. The shed 
"became semidark,"
 and the sharp r
attle of the dru
ms on two sides 
drowned the sic
k man’s groans
.  “There it
 is!... It again
!...” said Pie
"rre to himself, "
and an involunt
ary shudder ran 
down his spine. 
In the corporal�
��s changed face
",
in the sound "
"of his voice, in"
 the stirring an
d deafening nois
"e of the
drums,"
 he recognized t
"hat mysterious, "
callous force wh
ich compelled p
eople against th
eir will to kill
 their fellow me
n—that force t
he effect of wh
ich he had witne
ssed during the 
executions. To f
ear or to try to
 escape that fo
"rce, to address "
entreaties or ex
hortations to th
ose who served 
"as its tools, wa"
s useless. Pierr
e knew this now.
 One had to wait
 and endure. He
 did not again g
o to the sick ma
"n, nor turn to l"
"ook at
him, but"
 stood frowning 
by the door of t
he hut.  When 
that door was op
ened and the pri
"soners, crowding"
 against one an
other like a flo
"ck of sheep, squ"
eezed into the e
"xit, Pierre push"
ed his way forw
ard and approach
ed that very cap
tain who as the 
corporal had as
sured him was re
ady to do anythi
ng for him. The 
captain was also
 in marching ki
"t, and on his co"
ld face appeared
 that same it wh
ich Pierre had 
recognized in th
e corporal’s w
ords and in the 
roll of the drum
s.  “Pass on
", pass on!” th"
e captain reiter
"ated, frowning s"
"ternly, and
loo"
king at the pris
oners who throng
ed past him.  
Pierre went up t
"o him, though he"
 knew his attemp
t would be vain.
  “What now?
” the officer 
asked with a col
d look as if not
 recognizing Pi
erre.  Pierre 
told him about t
he sick man.  
“He’ll manag
"e to walk, devil"
 take him!” sa
id the captain. 
"“Pass on, pass"
 on!” he cont
inued without lo
oking at Pierre.
  “But he is
" dying,” Pierr"
e again began. 
 “Be so good.
..” shouted th
"e captain, frown"
ing angrily.  
“Dram-da-da-da
"m, dam-dam...”"
 rattled the dru
"ms, and Pierre u"
nderstood that 
this mysterious 
force completely
 controlled thes
e men and that i
t was now usele
ss to say any mo
re.  The offic
er prisoners wer
e separated from
 the soldiers an
d told to march 
 in front. There
 were about thir
"ty officers, wit"
h Pierre among t
"hem, and
about "
three hundred me
n.  The office
"rs, who had come"
 from the other 
"sheds, were all "
strangers to Pi
erre and much be
tter dressed tha
n he. They looke
d at him and at 
his shoes mistr
"ustfully, as at "
an alien. Not fa
r from him walke
d a fat major w
"ith a sallow, bl"
"oated, angry fac"
"e, who was weari"
ng a Kazán dres
sing gown tied 
round with a tow
"el, and who evid"
ently enjoyed th
e respect of hi
s fellow prisone
rs. He kept one 
"hand, in which h"
e clasped his to
"bacco
pouch, in"
side the bosom o
f his dressing g
own and held the
 stem of his pi
pe firmly with t
he other. Pantin
"g and puffing, t"
he major grumble
d and growled a
t everybody beca
use he thought h
e was being push
ed and that the
y were all hurry
ing when they ha
d nowhere to hur
ry to and were 
all surprised at
 something when 
there was nothin
g to be surprise
"d at.
Another, "
a thin little of
"ficer, was speak"
"ing to everyone,"
 conjecturing w
here they were n
ow being taken a
nd how far they 
would get that d
ay. An official
 in felt boots a
nd wearing a com
missariat unifor
m ran round from
 side to side a
nd gazed at the 
"ruins of Moscow,"
 loudly announci
ng his observat
ions as to what 
had been burned 
down and what th
is or that part 
 of the city was
 that they could
 see. A third of
"ficer, who by hi"
s accent was a 
"Pole, disputed w"
ith the commissa
"riat officer, ar"
guing that he wa
s mistaken in h
is identificatio
n of the differe
nt wards of Mosc
ow.  “What a
re you disputing
 about?” said 
the major angril
y. “What does 
it matter wheth
er it is St. Nic
holas or St. Bla
sius? You see it
’s burned dow
"n, and there’s"
 an end of it...
. What are you p
ushing for? Isn�
��t the road wi
de enough?” sa
"id he, turning t"
o a man behind h
im who was not 
pushing him at a
"ll.

“Oh, oh"
", oh! What have "
they done?” th
e prisoners on o
ne side and anot
her were heard 
saying as they g
azed on the char
red ruins. “Al
l beyond the ri
"ver, and Zúbova"
", and in the Kr�"
�mlin.... Just l
ook! There’s n
ot half of it l
"eft. Yes, I told"
 you—the whole
 quarter beyond 
"the river, and s"
o it is.”  
"“Well, you kno"
"w it’s burned,"
 so what’s the
 use of talking?
” said the ma
jor.  As they 
passed near a ch
urch in the Kham
óvniki (one of 
the few unburned
 quarters of Mo
scow) the whole 
mass of prisoner
s suddenly start
ed to one side 
and exclamations
 of horror and d
isgust were hear
"d.

“Ah, the"
 villains! What 
heathens! Yes; d
"ead, dead, so he"
 is... And smea
red with somethi
ng!”  Pierre
 too drew near t
he church where 
the thing was th
at evoked these 
"
exclamations, a"
nd dimly made ou
t something lean
ing against the 
palings surroun
ding the church.
 From the words 
of his comrades 
who saw better 
"than he did, he "
found that this 
was the body of 
"a man, set uprig"
ht against the 
palings with its
 face smeared wi
th soot.  “G
o on! What the d
evil... Go on! T
hirty thousand d
evils!...” the
 convoy guards 
began cursing an
d the French sol
"diers, with fres"
"h virulence,
dr"
ove away with th
eir swords the c
rowd of prisoner
s who were gazin
g at the dead m
an.      C
HAPTER XIV  Th
rough the cross 
streets of the K
hamóvniki quart
er the prisoners
"
marched, follo"
wed only by thei
r escort and the
 vehicles and wa
gons belonging 
"to that escort, "
but when they re
ached the supply
 stores they ca
me among a huge 
and closely pack
ed train of arti
llery mingled wi
th private vehi
cles.  At the 
bridge they all 
"halted, waiting "
for those in fro
nt to get across
. From the brid
ge they had a vi
ew of endless li
nes of moving ba
ggage trains be
fore and behind 
them. To the rig
"ht, where the Ka"
lúga road turns
 near Neskúchn
"y, endless rows "
of troops and ca
rts stretched aw
ay into the dis
tance. These wer
e troops of Beau
harnais’ corps
 which had start
ed before any o
f the others. Be
"hind, along the "
riverside and ac
ross the Stone 
"Bridge, were Ney"
’s troops and 
transport.  Da
"vout’s troops,"
 in whose charge
 were the prison
"ers, were crossi"
ng the Crimean 
bridge and some 
were already deb
ouching into the
 Kalúga road. 
But the baggage 
trains stretched
 out so that the
 last of Beauhar
nais’ train h
ad not yet got o
ut of Moscow and
 reached the Kal
úga road when 
the vanguard of 
Ney’s army was
 already emergin
g from the Great
 Ordýnka Stree
t.  When they 
had crossed the 
Crimean bridge t
he prisoners mov
ed a few steps 
"forward, halted,"
 and again moved
" on, and from al"
l sides vehicles
 and men crowde
d closer and clo
ser together. Th
ey advanced the 
few hundred pace
s that separate
d the bridge fro
m the Kalúga ro
"ad, taking more "
than an hour to
" do so, and came"
 out upon the sq
uare where the s
treets of the T
ransmoskvá ward
 and the Kalúga
" road converge, "
and the prisoner
s jammed close 
together had to 
stand for some h
ours at that cro
ssway. From all 
"
sides, like the"
 roar of the sea
", were heard the"
 rattle of wheel
"s, the
tramp of"
" feet, and inces"
sant shouts of a
nger and abuse. 
Pierre stood pr
essed against th
e wall of a char
"red house, liste"
ning to that noi
se which mingle
d in his imagina
tion with the ro
ll of the drums.
  To get a bet
"ter view, severa"
l officer prison
ers climbed onto
 the wall of th
e half-burned ho
use against whic
h Pierre was lea
ning.  “What
 crowds! Just lo
ok at the crowds
!... They’ve l
oaded goods even
 on the cannon!
" Look there, tho"
se are furs!” 
they exclaimed. 
“Just see what
 the blackguard
s have looted...
. There! See wha
t that one has b
ehind in the ca
"rt.... Why, thos"
e are settings t
aken from some i
"cons, by

 “That’s ri

the snout—on h
is snout! Like t
"his, we
shan’"
t get away befor
"e evening. Look,"
 look there.... 
"Why, that must b"

" Just look,

"��

Again, as "
at the church in
" Khamóvniki, a "
wave of general 
curiosity bore 
all the prisoner
s forward onto t
"he road, and Pie"
"rre, thanks to
"
"his stature, saw"
 over the heads 
of the others wh
at so attracted 
their curiosity
. In three carri
ages involved am
ong the munition
" carts, closely"
 squeezed togeth
"er, sat women wi"
"th rouged faces,"
 dressed in glar
"ing
colors, who"
 were shouting s
omething in shri
ll voices.  Fr
om the moment Pi
erre had recogni
zed the appearan
ce of the myster
ious force noth
ing had seemed t
o him strange or
 dreadful: neith
er the corpse s
meared with soot
 for fun nor the
se women hurryin
g away nor the b
urned ruins of 
Moscow. All that
 he now witnesse
d scarcely made 
an impression o
n him—as if hi
"s soul, making r"
eady for a hard 
"struggle, refuse"
d to receive im
pressions that m
ight weaken it. 
  The women’s
 vehicles drove 
by. Behind them 
"came more carts,"
" soldiers,
wago"
"ns, soldiers, gu"
"n carriages, car"
"riages, soldiers"
", ammunition car"
"ts,
more soldie"
"rs, and now and "
then women.  P
ierre did not se
e the people as 
individuals but 
saw their moveme
nt.  All these
 people and hors
es seemed driven
 forward by some
 invisible powe
r. During the ho
ur Pierre watche
d them they all 
came flowing fro
m the different
 streets with on
e and the same d
esire to get on 
quickly; they a
ll jostled one a
"nother, began to"
 grow angry and 
"to fight, white"
"
teeth gleamed, "
"brows frowned, e"
ver the same wor
ds of abuse flew
 from side to s
"ide, and all the"
 faces bore the 
same swaggeringl
y resolute and 
coldly cruel exp
ression that had
 struck Pierre t
hat morning on t
he corporal’s
 face when the d
rums were beatin
g.  It was not
 till nearly eve
ning that the of
ficer commanding
 the escort col
lected his men a
nd with shouts a
nd quarrels forc
ed his way in am
ong the baggage
" trains, and the"
" prisoners, hemm"
ed in on all sid
"es, emerged
ont"
o the Kalúga ro
ad.  They marc
hed very quickly
", without restin"
"g, and halted on"
ly when the sun 
 began to set. T
he baggage carts
 drew up close t
ogether and the 
men began to pr
epare for their 
night’s rest. 
They all appeare
d angry and dis
satisfied. For a
" long time, oath"
"s, angry shouts,"
 and fighting co
uld be heard fr
om all sides. A 
carriage that fo
llowed the escor
t ran into one 
of the carts and
 knocked a hole 
in it with its p
ole. Several so
ldiers ran towar
d the cart from 
different sides:
 some beat the 
carriage horses 
"on their heads, "
turning them asi
"de, others fough"
t among themsel
"ves, and Pierre "
saw that one Ger
man was badly wo
unded on the hea
d by a sword. 
 It seemed that
" all these men, "
now that they ha
d stopped amid f
ields in the ch
ill dusk of the 
"autumn evening, "
experienced one 
and the same fe
eling of unpleas
ant awakening fr
om the hurry and
 eagerness to pu
sh on that had 
seized them at t
he start. Once a
t a standstill t
hey all seemed 
to understand th
at they did not 
yet know where t
"hey were going, "
and that much t
hat was painful 
and difficult aw
aited them on th
is journey.  D
uring this halt 
the escort treat
ed the prisoners
 even worse than
 they had done 
at the start. It
 was here that t
he prisoners for
 the first time 
 received horsef
lesh for their m
eat ration.  F
rom the officer 
down to the lowe
st soldier they 
showed what seem
ed like persona
l spite against 
each of the pris
"oners, in unexpe"
cted contrast to
 their former f
riendly relation
s.  This spite
 increased still
" more when, on c"
alling over the 
roll of prisone
"rs, it was found"
 that in the bus
tle of leaving M
oscow one Russia
"n
soldier, who "
had pretended to
 suffer from col
"ic, had escaped."
 Pierre saw a F
renchman beat a 
Russian soldier 
cruelly for stra
ying too far fro
"m
the road, and"
 heard his frien
d the captain re
primand and thre
aten to court-m
artial a noncomm
issioned officer
 on account of t
he escape of the
 Russian. To th
e noncommissione
d officer’s ex
cuse that the pr
isoner was ill 
and could not wa
"lk, the officer "
replied that the
 order was to sh
oot those who l
agged behind. Pi
erre felt that t
hat fatal force 
which had crush
ed him during th
"e executions, bu"
t which he had n
ot felt during h
is imprisonment
", now again cont"
rolled his exist
ence. It was ter
"rible, but
he f"
elt that in prop
ortion to the ef
forts of that fa
tal force to cru
"sh
him, there g"
rew and strength
ened in his soul
 a power of life
 independent of
 it.  He ate h
is supper of buc
kwheat soup with
 horseflesh and 
chatted with his
 comrades.  N
either Pierre no
r any of the oth
ers spoke of wha
t they had seen 
"in
Moscow, or o"
f the roughness 
of their treatme
nt by the French
", or of the
ord"
er to shoot them
 which had been 
announced to the
m. As if in reac
tion against th
e worsening of t
heir position th
ey were all part
icularly animat
ed and gay. They
 spoke of person
al reminiscences
", of amusing
sc"
enes they had wi
tnessed during t
"he campaign, and"
 avoided all tal
k of their pres
ent situation. 
 The sun had se
t long since. Br
ight stars shone
 out here and th
ere in the sky.
 A red glow as o
f a conflagratio
n spread above t
he horizon from 
the rising full
" moon, and that "
vast red ball sw
ayed strangely i
n the gray haze
. It grew light.
 The evening was
" ending, but the"
 night had not y
et come. Pierre
 got up and left
 his new compani
"ons, crossing be"
tween the campf
ires to the othe
r side of the ro
ad where he had 
been told the c
ommon soldier pr
isoners were sta
tioned. He wante
d to talk to the
m. On the road 
he was stopped b
y a French senti
nel who ordered 
him back.  Pie
"rre turned back,"
 not to his comp
anions by the ca
"mpfire, but to a"
n unharnessed c
art where there 
was nobody. Tuck
ing his legs und
er him and drop
ping his head he
 sat down on the
 cold ground by 
the wheel of the
 cart and remai
ned motionless a
 long while sunk
 in thought. Sud
denly he burst 
out into a fit o
"f his broad, goo"
d-natured laught
"er, so loud that"
 men from vario
us sides turned 
with surprise to
 see what this s
trange and evid
ently solitary l
aughter could me
an.  “Ha-ha-
ha!” laughed P
ierre. And he sa
id aloud to hims

ded with the cr

ces of many men 
"had grown quiet,"
 the red campfi

 paler and dying

 hung the full m

 fields beyond t

"arther still, be"

 up at the sky a

APTER XV  In t
he early days of
 October another
 envoy came to K
utúzov with a l
etter from Napo
leon proposing p
eace and falsely
 dated from Mosc
"ow, though
Napo"
leon was already
 not far from Ku
túzov on the ol
d Kalúga road. 
 Kutúzov replie
d to this letter
 as he had done 
to the one forme
rly brought by 
"Lauriston, sayin"
g that there cou
ld be no questio
n of peace.  S
oon after that a
 report was rece
ived from Dórok
hov’s guerrill
a detachment op
erating to the l
eft of Tarútino
 that troops of 
Broussier’s d
ivision had been
 seen at Formín
sk and that bein
g separated from
 the rest of th
e French army th
ey might easily 
be destroyed. Th
e soldiers and 
officers again d
emanded action. 
Generals on the 
"staff, excited b"
y the memory of
 the easy victor
"y at Tarútino, "
urged Kutúzov t
o carry out Dó
rokhov’s sugge
stion. Kutúzov 
did not consider
 any offensive n
ecessary. The r
esult was a comp
romise which was
 inevitable: a s
mall detachment 
was sent to For
mínsk to attack
 Broussier.  B
y a strange coin
"cidence, this ta"
"sk, which turned"
 out to be a mos
t difficult and
" important one, "
was entrusted to
 Dokhtúrov—th
at same modest 
little Dokhtúro
v whom no one ha
d described to u
s as drawing up 
plans of battle
"s, dashing about"
 in front of reg
"iments, showerin"
g crosses on ba
"tteries, and so "
"on, and who was "
thought to be an
d was spoken of 
as undecided an
d undiscerning�
�but whom we fin
d commanding whe
rever the posit
ion was most dif
ficult all throu
gh the Russo-Fre
nch wars from A
usterlitz to the
 year 1813. At A
usterlitz he rem
ained last at th
"e
Augezd dam, r"
allying the regi
"ments, saving wh"
at was possible 
when all were f
lying and perish
ing and not a si
ngle general was
 left in the rea
r guard. Ill wi
th fever he went
 to Smolénsk wi
th twenty thousa
nd men to defen
d the town again
st Napoleon’s 
whole army. In S
"molénsk, at the"
 Malákhov Gate
", he had hardly "
dozed off in a p
aroxysm of fever
 before he was 
awakened by the 
bombardment of t
he town—and Sm
olénsk held out
 all day long. 
At the battle of
" Borodinó, when"
 Bagratión was 
killed and nine 
 tenths of the m
en of our left f
lank had fallen 
and the full for
ce of the Frenc
h artillery fire
 was directed ag
"ainst it, the ma"
n sent there was
 this same irre
solute and undis
cerning Dokhtúr
ov—Kutúzov ha
stening to rect
ify a mistake he
 had made by sen
ding someone els
e there first. 
And the quiet li
ttle Dokhtúrov 
"rode thither, an"
d Borodinó beca
me the greatest
 glory of the Ru
ssian army. Many
 heroes have bee
n described to 
us in verse and 
"prose, but of Do"
khtúrov scarcel
y a word has bee
n said.  It wa
s Dokhtúrov aga
in whom they sen
t to Formínsk a
nd from there to
 Málo-Yaroslá
"vets, the place "
where the last b
attle with the F
rench was fough
t and where the 
obvious disinteg
ration of the Fr
ench army began;
 and we are tol
d of many genius
es and heroes of
 that period of 
"the
campaign, b"
ut of Dokhtúrov
 nothing or very
 little is said 
and that dubiou
sly. And this si
lence about Dokh
túrov is the cl
earest testimony
 to his merit. 
  It is natural
 for a man who d
oes not understa
nd the workings 
of a machine to
 imagine that a 
shaving that has
 fallen into it 
by chance and i
s interfering wi
th its action an
d tossing about 
in it is its mos
t important par
t. The man who d
oes not understa
nd the construct
ion of the mach
ine cannot conce
ive that the sma
ll connecting co
gwheel which re
volves quietly i
s one of the mos
t essential part
s of the machine
", and
not the s"
having which mer
ely harms and hi
nders the workin
g.  On the ten
th of October wh
en Dokhtúrov ha
d gone halfway t
o Formínsk and 
 stopped at the 
village of Arist
"óvo, preparing "
faithfully to ex
ecute the order
s he had receive
"d, the whole Fre"
"nch army having,"
 in its convulsi
"ve
movement, re"
ached Murat’s 
position apparen
tly in order to 
give battle—s
uddenly without 
any reason turne
d off to the lef
t onto the new 
Kalúga road and
 began to enter 
"Formínsk, where"
 only Broussier 
had been till t
hen. At that tim
e Dokhtúrov had
 under his comma
"nd, besides
Dó"
rokhov’s detac
"hment, the two s"
mall guerrilla d
etachments of Fi
gner and Seslá
vin.  On the e
vening of Octobe
r 11 Seslávin c
ame to the Arist
óvo headquarter
s with a French
 guardsman he ha
d captured. The 
prisoner said th
at the troops t
hat had entered 
Formínsk that d
ay were the vang
uard of the whol
"e
army, that Na"
poleon was there
 and the whole a
rmy had left Mos
cow four days p
reviously. That 
same evening a h
ouse serf who ha
d come from Bó
rovsk said he ha
d seen an immens
e army entering 
the town. Some 
Cossacks of Dokh
túrov’s detac
hment reported h
aving sighted th
e French Guards
 marching along 
the road to Bór
ovsk. From all t
hese reports it 
was evident tha
t where they had
 expected to mee
t a single divis
ion there was n
ow the whole Fre
nch army marchin
g from Moscow in
 an unexpected 
direction—alon
g the Kalúga ro
ad. Dokhtúrov w
as unwilling to 
undertake any a
"ction, as it was"
 not clear to hi
m now what he ou
ght to do. He ha
d been ordered 
to attack Formí
nsk. But only Br
oussier had been
 there at that 
time and now the
 whole French ar
my was there. Er
mólov wished to
 act on his own
" judgment, but D"
okhtúrov insist
ed that he must 
have Kutúzov’
s instructions.
 So it was decid
ed to send a dis
patch to the sta
ff.  For this 
purpose a capabl
"e officer, Bolkh"
"ovítinov, was c"
"hosen, who
was "
to explain the w
hole affair by w
"ord of mouth, be"
sides delivering
 a written repo
rt. Toward midni
ght Bolkhovítin
"ov, having recei"
ved the dispatc
h and verbal ins
"tructions, gallo"
ped off to the G
eneral Staff ac
companied by a C
ossack with spar
e horses.    
   CHAPTER XVI
  It was a war
"m, dark, autumn "
night. It had be
en raining for f
our days. Havin
g changed horses
 twice and gallo
ped twenty miles
 in an hour and 
a half over a s
"ticky, muddy roa"
"d, Bolkhovítino"
v reached Litash
ëvka after one
 o’clock at ni
ght. Dismounting
 at a cottage on
 whose wattle fe
nce hung a sign
"board, GENERAL S"
"TAFF, and throwi"
ng down his rein
"s, he entered
a"
 dark passage. 
 “The general
" on duty, quick!"
 It’s very imp
ortant!” said 
he to someone w
ho had risen and
 was sniffing in
 the dark passag
e.  “He has 
been very unwell
 since the eveni
ng and this is t
he third night 
he has not slept
",” said the or"
derly pleadingly
 in a whisper. �
��You should wa
ke the captain f
irst.”  “B
ut this is very 
"important, from "
General Dokhtúr
"ov,” said
Bol"
"khovítinov, ent"
ering the open d
oor which he had
 found by feelin
g in the dark. 
  The orderly h
ad gone in befor
e him and began 
waking somebody.
  “Your hono
"r, your honor! A"
 courier.”  
“What? What’
s that? From who
m?” came a sle
epy voice.  �
�From Dokhtúrov
 and from Alexé
y Petróvich. Na
poleon is at For
"mínsk,”
said"
" Bolkhovítinov,"
 unable to see i
n the dark who w
as speaking but 
 guessing by the
 voice that it w
as not Konovnít
syn.  The man 
who had wakened 
yawned and stret
ched himself.  
 “I don’t li
"ke waking him,�"
"� he said, fumbl"
ing for somethin
g. “He is very
 ill. Perhaps t
his is only a ru
mor.”  “He
re is the dispat
"ch,” said Bolk"
hovítinov. “M
y orders are to 
give it at once
 to the general 
on duty.”  �
"��Wait a moment,"
 I’ll light a 
candle. You damn
"ed rascal, where"
 do you always 
hide it?” said
 the voice of th
e man who was st
retching himself
",
to the orderl"
y. (This was Shc
"herbínin, Konov"
nítsyn’s adju
tant.) “I’ve
"
found it, I’"
ve found it!” 
he added.  The
 orderly was str
iking a light an
d Shcherbínin w
as fumbling for 
 something on th
e candlestick. 
"
“Oh, the nas"
ty beasts!” sa
id he with disgu
st.  By the li
ght of the spark
s Bolkhovítinov
 saw Shcherbíni
n’s youthful f
ace as he held 
"the candle, and "
the face of anot
her man who was 
still asleep. T
his was Konovní
tsyn.  When th
e flame of the s
ulphur splinters
 kindled by the 
tinder burned u
"p, first blue an"
"d then red, Shch"
erbínin lit the
" tallow candle, "
from the candle
stick of which t
he cockroaches t
hat had been gna
wing it were ru
"nning away, and "
looked at the me
ssenger. Bolkhov
ítinov was besp
attered all ove
r with mud and h
ad smeared his f
ace by wiping it
 with his sleeve
.  “Who gave
 the report?” 
inquired Shcherb
"ínin, taking th"
e envelope.  �
��The news is re
"liable,” said "
Bolkhovítinov. 
"“Prisoners, Co"
"ssacks, and
the"
 scouts all say 
the same thing.�
��  “There�
�s nothing to be
" done, we’ll h"
"ave to wake him,"
” said Shcherb
"ínin,
rising a"
nd going up to t
he man in the ni
ghtcap who lay c
overed by a gre
atcoat. “Peter
 Petróvich!” 
said he. (Konovn
ítsyn did not s
tir.) “To the
 General Staff!�
�� he said with 
"a smile, knowing"
 that those word
s would be sure
 to arouse him. 
  And in fact t
he head in the n
ightcap was lift
ed at once. On 
Konovnítsyn’s
" handsome, resol"
ute face with ch
eeks flushed by 
"fever,
there st"
ill remained for
 an instant a fa
raway dreamy exp
ression remote 
from present aff
"airs, but then h"
e suddenly start
ed and his face 
assumed its hab
itual calm and f
irm appearance. 
"

“Well, what"
 is it? From who
m?” he asked i
mmediately but w
"ithout hurry,
b"
linking at the l
ight.  While l
istening to the 
officer’s repo
rt Konovnítsyn 
broke the seal a
nd read the dis
patch. Hardly ha
d he done so bef
ore he lowered h
is legs in thei
r woolen stockin
gs to the earthe
n floor and bega
n putting on his
 boots. Then he
 took off his ni
"ghtcap, combed h"
is hair over his
" temples,
and d"
onned his cap. 
 “Did you get
 here quickly? L
et us go to his 
Highness.”  
Konovnítsyn had
 understood at o
nce that the new
s brought was of
 great importan
ce and that no t
ime must be lost
. He did not con
sider or ask hi
mself whether th
e news was good 
or bad. That did
 not interest hi
m. He regarded 
the whole busine
ss of the war no
t with his intel
ligence or his 
reason but by so
mething else. Th
ere was within h
im a deep unexpr
essed convictio
n that all would
" be well, but th"
at one must not 
trust to this a
nd still less sp
"eak about it, bu"
t must only atte
nd to one’s ow
n work. And he 
"did his work, gi"
ving his whole s
trength to the t
ask.  Peter Pe
tróvich Konovn�
"�tsyn, like Dokh"
"túrov, seems to"
 have been inclu
ded merely for 
propriety’s sa
ke in the list o
f the so-called 
heroes of 1812�
"��the Barclays, "
"Raévskis, Ermó"
"lovs, Plátovs, "
and Milorádovic
hes. Like Dokht
úrov he had the
 reputation of b
eing a man of ve
ry limited capac
ity and informa
"tion, and like D"
okhtúrov he nev
er made plans of
 battle but was
 always found wh
ere the situatio
n was most diffi
cult. Since his 
 appointment as 
general on duty 
he had always sl
ept with his doo
"r open,
giving "
orders that ever
y messenger shou
ld be allowed to
 wake him up. In
 battle he was 
always under fir
"e, so that Kutú"
zov reproved him
 for it and fea
red to send him 
"to the front, an"
d like Dokhtúro
v he was one of 
those unnoticed
" cogwheels that,"
 without clatter
" or noise, const"
itute the most 
essential part o
f the machine. 
 Coming out of 
the hut into the
" damp, dark nigh"
t Konovnítsyn 
frowned—partly
 from an increas
ed pain in his h
ead and partly a
t the unpleasan
t thought that o
"ccurred to him, "
of how all that 
nest of influen
tial men on the 
staff would be s
tirred up by thi
"s news,
especia"
"lly Bennigsen, w"
ho ever since Ta
rútino had been
 at daggers dra
wn with Kutúzov
; and how they w
ould make sugges
"tions, quarrel, "
"issue
orders, a"
nd rescind them.
 And this premon
ition was disagr
eeable to him t
hough he knew it
 could not be he
lped.  And in 
"fact Toll, to wh"
om he went to co
mmunicate the ne
"ws, immediately"
 began to expoun
d his plans to a
 general sharing
" his quarters, u"
ntil Konovníts
"yn, who listened"
 in weary silenc
"e, reminded him "
that they must 
go to see his Hi
ghness.     
  CHAPTER XVII 
  Kutúzov like
 all old people 
did not sleep mu
ch at night. He 
often fell asle
ep unexpectedly 
"in the daytime, "
"but at night, ly"
ing on his bed 
without undressi
"ng, he generally"
 remained awake 
thinking.  So 
he lay now on hi
"s bed, supportin"
"g his large, hea"
"vy, scarred head"
 on his plump h
"and, with his on"
"e eye open, medi"
tating and peeri
ng into the dar
kness.  Since 
"Bennigsen, who c"
orresponded with
 the Emperor and
 had more influ
ence than anyone
 else on the sta
"ff, had begun to"
" avoid him, Kut�"
�zov was more a
t ease as to the
 possibility of 
himself and his 
troops being ob
liged to take pa
rt in useless ag
gressive movemen
ts. The lesson o
f the Tarútino
 battle and of t
he day before it
", which Kutúzov"
 remembered with
"
pain, must, he"
" thought, have s"
ome effect on ot
hers too.  “
They must unders
tand that we can
 only lose by ta
king the offensi
ve. Patience an
d time are my wa
"rriors, my champ"
"ions,” thought"
 Kutúzov. He k
new that an appl
e should not be 
plucked while it
 is green. It wi
ll fall of itse
"lf when ripe, bu"
t if picked unri
pe the apple is 
"spoiled, the tre"
"e
is harmed, an"
d your teeth are
 set on edge. Li
ke an experience
d sportsman he 
knew that the be
"ast was wounded,"
 and wounded as 
only the whole 
strength of Russ
ia could have wo
"unded it, but wh"
ether it was mor
tally wounded o
r not was still 
an undecided que
stion. Now by th
e fact of Lauri
ston and Barthé
lemi having been
" sent, and by th"
e reports of the
"
guerrillas, Ku"
túzov was almos
t sure that the 
wound was mortal
. But he needed
 further proofs 
and it was neces
sary to wait.  
 “They want to
 run to see how 
they have wounde
d it. Wait and w
e shall see! Co
ntinual maneuver
"s, continual adv"
ances!” though
t he. “What fo
r? Only to dist
inguish themselv
es! As if fighti
ng were fun. The
y are like chil
dren from whom o
ne can’t get a
ny sensible acco
unt of what has 
 happened becaus
e they all want 
to show how well
 they can fight.
 But that’s n
ot what is neede
d now.  “And
 what ingenious 
maneuvers they a
ll propose to me
! It seems to t
hem that when th
ey have thought 
of two or three 
contingencies”
 (he remembered
 the general pla
n sent him from 
Petersburg) “t
hey have forese
en everything. B
ut the contingen
cies are endless
.”  The unde
cided question a
s to whether the
 wound inflicted
 at Borodinó wa
s mortal or not
 had hung over K
utúzov’s head
 for a whole mon
th. On the one 
hand the French 
had occupied Mos
cow. On the othe
r Kutúzov felt 
assured with al
l his being that
 the terrible bl
ow into which he
 and all the Ru
ssians had put t
heir whole stren
gth must have be
en mortal. But i
n any case proo
fs were needed; 
he had waited a 
whole month for 
them and grew m
ore impatient th
e longer he wait
ed. Lying on his
 bed during thos
e sleepless nig
hts he did just 
what he reproach
ed those younger
 generals for d
oing. He imagine
d all sorts of p
ossible continge
"ncies, just like"
 the younger me
"n, but with this"
" difference, tha"
t he saw thousan
ds of contingen
cies instead of 
two or three and
 based nothing o
n them. The lon
ger he thought t
he more continge
ncies presented 
themselves. He 
imagined all sor
ts of movements 
of the Napoleoni
c army as a whol
e or in section
s—against Pete
"rsburg, or again"
"st him, or to ou"
tflank him. He 
thought too of t
he possibility (
which he feared 
most of all) tha
t Napoleon migh
t fight him with
 his own weapon 
and remain in Mo
scow awaiting h
im. Kutúzov eve
n imagined that 
Napoleon’s arm
y might turn bac
k through Medý
"n and Yukhnóv, "
but the one thin
g he could not f
oresee was what
 happened—the 
"insane, convulsi"
ve stampede of N
apoleon’s army
 during its fir
st eleven days a
fter leaving Mos
cow: a stampede 
which made poss
ible what Kutúz
ov had not yet e
ven dared to thi
nk of—the comp
lete exterminat
ion of the Frenc
h. Dórokhov’s
 report about Br
oussier’s div
"ision, the guerr"
illas’ reports
 of distress in 
Napoleon’s arm
"y, rumors
of pr"
eparations for l
"eaving Moscow, a"
ll confirmed the
 supposition tha
t the French ar
my was beaten an
d preparing for 
flight. But thes
e were only sup
"positions, which"
 seemed importan
t to the younger
 men but not to 
 Kutúzov. With 
his sixty years�
�� experience he
 knew what value
 to attach to r
"umors, knew how "
apt people who d
esire anything a
re to group all 
news so that it
 appears to conf
irm what they de
"sire, and he kne"
w how readily i
n such cases the
y omit all that 
makes for the co
ntrary. And the 
more he desired
 it the less he 
allowed himself 
to believe it. T
his question ab
sorbed all his m
ental powers. Al
l else was to hi
m only life’s 
 customary routi
ne. To such cust
omary routine be
longed his conve
rsations with t
"he staff, the le"
tters he wrote f
rom Tarútino to
 Madame de Staë
"l,
the reading "
"of novels, the d"
istribution of a
"wards, his corre"
spondence with 
"Petersburg, and "
so on. But the d
estruction of th
"e French, which "
he alone foresa
"w, was his heart"
’s one desire.
  On the night
 of the eleventh
 of October he l
ay leaning on hi
s arm and think
ing of that.  
There was a stir
 in the next roo
m and he heard t
he steps of Toll
",
Konovnítsyn,"
 and Bolkhovíti
"nov.

“Eh, w"
ho’s there? Co
"me in, come in! "
What news?” th
e field marshal 
called out to t
hem.  While a 
footman was ligh
"ting a candle, T"
oll communicated
 the substance 
of the news.  
“Who brought i
t?” asked Kut�
�zov with a look
" which, when the"
 candle was lit
", struck Toll by"
 its cold severi
ty.  “There 
can be no doubt 
"about it, your H"
ighness.”  �
"��Call him in, c"
all him here.”
  Kutúzov sat
 up with one leg
 hanging down fr
om the bed and h
is big paunch r
esting against t
he other which w
as doubled under
 him. He screwed
 up his seeing 
eye to scrutiniz
e the messenger 
"more carefully, "
as if wishing to
 read in his fa
ce what preoccup
ied his own mind
".

“Tell me,"
" tell me, friend"
",” said he to "
Bolkhovítinov i
"n his low, aged"
"
voice, as he pu"
lled together th
e shirt which ga
ped open on his 
"chest,
“come "
nearer—nearer.
 What news have 
you brought me? 
Eh? That Napoleo
n has left Mosc
ow? Are you sure
? Eh?”  Bolk
hovítinov gave 
a detailed accou
nt from the begi
nning of all he 
had been told t
o report.  “
"Speak quicker, q"
uicker! Don’t 
torture me!” K
utúzov interrup
ted him.  Bolk
hovítinov told 
him everything a
nd was then sile
"nt, awaiting
in"
structions. Toll
 was beginning t
o say something 
but Kutúzov che
cked him. He tr
ied to say somet
"hing, but his fa"
ce suddenly puck

ed; he waved his
 arm at Toll and
 turned to the o
pposite side of 
"
the room, to th"
e corner darkene

"

“O Lord, my"
" Creator, Thou h"

" thank Thee, O
"
Lord!” and he 
wept.      
 CHAPTER XVIII 
 From the time 
he received this
 news to the end
 of the campaign
 all Kutúzov�
�s activity was 
directed toward 
restraining his 
"troops, by
auth"
"ority, by guile,"
 and by entreaty
", from useless a"
"ttacks,
maneuve"
"rs, or encounter"
s with the peris
hing enemy. Dokh
túrov went to 
Málo-Yarosláve
"ts, but Kutúzov"
 lingered with t
he main army and
 gave orders fo
r the evacuation
 of Kalúga—a 
retreat beyond w
hich town seemed
 to him quite p
ossible.  Ever
ywhere Kutúzov 
"retreated, but t"
he enemy without
 waiting for his
 retreat fled i
n the opposite d
irection.  Nap
oleon’s histor
ians describe to
 us his skilled 
maneuvers at Tar
útino and Mál
"o-Yaroslávets, "
and make conject
ures as to what 
would have happ
ened had Napoleo
n been in time t
o penetrate into
 the rich southe
rn provinces. 
 But not to spe
ak of the fact t
hat nothing prev
ented him from a
dvancing into t
hose southern pr
ovinces (for the
 Russian army di
d not bar his w
"ay), the histori"
ans forget that 
nothing could ha
ve saved his arm
"y, for
then alr"
eady it bore wit
hin itself the g
erms of inevitab
le ruin. How co
uld that army—
which had found 
abundant supplie
s in Moscow and 
had trampled th
em underfoot ins
tead of keeping 
"them, and on arr"
iving at Smolé
nsk had looted p
rovisions instea
d of storing the
m—how could th
at army recuper
ate in Kalúga p
"rovince, which w"
as inhabited by 
Russians such a
s those who live
"d in Moscow, and"
 where fire had 
the same propert
y of consuming 
what was set abl
aze?  That arm
y could not reco
ver anywhere. Si
nce the battle o
f Borodinó and
 the pillage of 
Moscow it had bo
rne within itsel
"f, as it were, t"
he chemical ele
ments of dissolu
tion.  The mem
bers of what had
 once been an ar
my—Napoleon hi
mself and all hi
s soldiers--fle
d without knowin
"g whither, each "
concerned only t
o make his esca
pe as quickly as
 possible from t
"his position, of"
 the hopelessnes
s of which they
 were all more o
r less vaguely c
onscious.  So 
it came about th
at at the counci
l at Málo-Yaros
"lávets, when th"
e generals pret
ending to confer
 together expres
sed various opin
"ions, all
mouth"
s were closed by
 the opinion utt
ered by the simp
le-minded soldie
"r
Mouton who, s"
"peaking last, sa"
id what they all
 felt: that the 
one thing needf
ul was to get aw
ay as quickly as
 possible; and n
"o one, not
even"
" Napoleon, could"
 say anything ag
ainst that truth
 which they all 
 recognized.  
But though they 
all realized tha
t it was necessa
"ry to get away, "
there still rem
ained a feeling 
of shame at admi
tting that they 
must flee. An e
xternal shock wa
s needed to over
"come that shame,"
 and this shock 
came in due tim
e. It was what t
he French called
 “le hourra de
 l’Empereur.�
�  The day aft
er the council a
t Málo-Yaroslá
vets Napoleon ro
de out early in 
 the morning ami
d the lines of h
is army with his
 suite of marsha
ls and an escor
"t, on the pretex"
t of inspecting 
the army and the
 scene of the p
revious and of t
he impending bat
tle. Some Cossac
ks on the prowl 
for booty fell 
in with the Empe
ror and very nea
rly captured him
. If the Cossac
ks did not captu
re Napoleon then
", what saved him"
 was the very t
hing that was de
stroying the Fre
"nch army, the bo"
oty on which the
 Cossacks fell.
 Here as at Tar�
�tino they went 
"after plunder, l"
eaving the men.
 Disregarding Na
poleon they rush
ed after the plu
nder and Napoleo
n managed to es
cape.  When le
s enfants du Don
 might so easily
 have taken the 
Emperor himself 
 in the midst of
" his army, it wa"
s clear that the
re was nothing f
or it but to fl
y as fast as pos
sible along the 
"nearest, familia"
r road. Napoleon
 with his forty
-year-old stomac
h understood tha
"t hint, not feel"
ing his former 
agility and bold
"ness, and under "
the influence of
 the fright the
 Cossacks had gi
ven him he at on
ce agreed with M
outon and issued
 orders—as th
e historians tel
l us—to retrea
t by the Smolén
sk road.  That
 Napoleon agreed
" with Mouton, an"
d that the army 
"retreated, does"
 not prove that 
Napoleon caused 
"it to retreat, b"
ut that the forc
es which influe
nced the whole a
rmy and directed
 it along the Mo
zháysk (that is
",
the Smolénsk"
) road acted sim
ultaneously on h
im also.    
  CHAPTER XIX 
  A man in moti
on always devise
s an aim for tha
t motion. To be 
able to go a th
ousand miles he 
must imagine tha
t something good
 awaits him at t
he end of those
 thousand miles.
 One must have t
he prospect of a
 promised land 
to have the stre
ngth to move.  
 The promised la
nd for the Frenc
h during their a
dvance had been 
"Moscow,
during "
their retreat it
 was their nativ
e land. But that
 native land wa
"s too far off, a"
nd for a man goi
ng a thousand mi
les it is absolu
tely necessary 
to set aside his
 final goal and 
to say to himsel
f: “Today I s
hall get to a pl
ace twenty-five 
miles off where 
I shall rest and
 spend the nigh
"t,” and during"
 the first day�
�s journey that 
resting place e
clipses his ulti
mate goal and at
tracts all his h
opes and desires
. And the impul
ses felt by a si
ngle person are 
always magnified
 in a crowd.  
For the French r
etreating along 
the old Smoléns
"k road, the fina"
l goal—their 
native land—wa
"s too remote, an"
d their immediat
e goal was Smol
"énsk, toward wh"
ich all their de
"sires and hopes,"
 enormously int
ensified in the 
"mass, urged them"
 on. It was not 
that they knew t
hat much food a
nd fresh troops 
awaited them in 
"Smolénsk, nor t"
hat they were t
old so (on the c
ontrary their su
"perior officers,"
 and Napoleon hi
"mself,
knew tha"
t provisions wer
"e scarce there),"
 but because thi
s alone could g
ive them strengt
h to move on and
 endure their pr
esent privations
. So both those
 who knew and th
ose who did not 
know deceived th
"emselves, and
p"
ushed on to Smol
énsk as to a pr
omised land.  
Coming out onto 
the highroad the
 French fled wit
h surprising ene
rgy and unheard
-of rapidity tow
ard the goal the
y had fixed on. 
Besides the com
mon impulse whic
h bound the whol
e crowd of Frenc
h into one mass 
and supplied th
em with a certai
"n energy, there "
was another caus
e binding them 
together—their
 great numbers. 
As with the phys
ical law of grav
"ity,
their enor"
mous mass drew t
he individual hu
man atoms to its
elf. In their h
undreds of thous
ands they moved 
like a whole nat
ion.  Each of 
them desired not
hing more than t
o give himself u
p as a prisoner 
 to escape from 
all this horror 
and misery; but 
on the one hand 
the force of th
is common attrac
tion to Smoléns
"k, their goal, d"
rew each of them
 in the same di
rection; on the 
other hand an ar
my corps could n
ot surrender to
" a company, and "
though the Frenc
h availed themse
lves of every c
onvenient opport
unity to detach 
themselves and t
o surrender on t
he slightest de
"cent pretext, su"
ch pretexts did 
not always occur
. Their very nu
mbers and their 
crowded and swif
t movement depri
ved them of that
 possibility an
d rendered it no
t only difficult
 but impossible 
for the Russian
s to stop this m
"ovement, to whic"
h the French wer
e directing all 
 their energies.
 Beyond a certai
n limit no mecha
nical disruption
 of the body co
uld hasten the p
rocess of decomp
osition.  A lu
mp of snow canno
t be melted inst
antaneously. The
re is a certain 
 limit of time i
n less than whic
h no amount of h
eat can melt the
 snow. On the c
ontrary the grea
ter the heat the
 more solidified
 the remaining s
now becomes.  
 Of the Russian 
commanders Kutú
zov alone unders
tood this. When 
the flight of t
he French army a
long the Smolén
sk road became w
"ell defined, wha"
t Konovnítsyn 
had foreseen on 
the night of the
 eleventh of Oct
ober began to o
ccur. The superi
or officers all 
wanted to distin
guish themselves
",
to cut off, t"
"o seize, to capt"
"ure, and to over"
throw the French
", and all
clamo"
red for action. 
  Kutúzov alon
e used all his p
ower (and such p
ower is very lim
ited in the cas
e of any command
er in chief) to 
prevent an attac
k.  He could n
ot tell them wha
t we say now: �
"�Why fight, why "
"block the road,"
 losing our own 
men and inhumanl
y slaughtering u
nfortunate wretc
hes? What is th
"e use of that, w"
hen a third of t
heir army has me
lted away on the
 road from Mosc
ow to Vyázma wi
thout any battle
?” But drawing
 from his aged 
wisdom what they
 could understan
"d, he told them "
of the golden b
"ridge, and they "
laughed at and s
"landered him, fl"
inging themselve
"s on,
rending a"
nd exulting over
 the dying beast
".

Ermólov, M"
"ilorádovich, Pl"
"átov, and other"
s in proximity t
o the French ne
ar Vyázma could
 not resist thei
r desire to cut 
off and break up
 two French cor
"ps, and by way o"
f reporting thei
r intention to K
utúzov they se
nt him a blank s
heet of paper in
 an envelope.  
 And try as Kut�
�zov might to re
strain the troop
"s, our men attac"
"ked,
trying to "
bar the road. In
fantry regiments
", we are told, a"
dvanced to the 
attack with musi
c and with drums
" beating, and ki"
lled and lost th
ousands of men.
  But they did
 not cut off or 
overthrow anybod
y and the French
" army,
closing "
up more firmly a
"t the danger, co"
"ntinued, while s"
teadily melting 
"
away, to pursue"
 its fatal path 
to Smolénsk.  
     BOOK FO
URTEEN: 1812  
    CHAPTER 
I  The Battle 
"of Borodinó, wi"
th the occupatio
n of Moscow that
 followed it an
d the flight of 
the French witho
ut further confl
"icts, is one of "
the most instru
ctive phenomena 
in history.  A
ll historians ag
ree that the ext
ernal activity o
f states and nat
ions in their c
onflicts with on
e another is exp
"ressed in wars, "
and that as a d
irect result of 
greater or less 
success in war t
he political str
ength of states
 and nations inc
reases or decrea
ses.  Strange 
as may be the hi
storical account
 of how some kin
"g or emperor,
h"
aving quarreled 
"with another, co"
"llects an army, "
fights his enemy
"’s
army, gain"
s a victory by k
"illing three, fi"
"ve, or ten thous"
"and men, and
su"
bjugates a kingd
om and an entire
 nation of sever
"al millions, all"
 the facts of h
istory (as far a
s we know it) co
nfirm the truth 
of the statemen
t that the great
er or lesser suc
cess of one army
 against another
"
is the cause, "
or at least an e
ssential indicat
"ion, of an incre"
ase or decrease
 in the strength
 of the nation�
�even though it 
is unintelligibl
e why the defea
t of an army—a
 hundredth part 
of a nation—sh
ould oblige tha
t whole nation t
o submit. An arm
y gains a victor
"y, and at once t"
he rights of th
e conquering nat
ion have increas
ed to the detrim
ent of the defe
ated. An army ha
s suffered defea
"t, and at once a"
 people loses it
s rights in pro
portion to the s
everity of the r
"everse, and if i"
ts army suffers
 a complete defe
at the nation is
 quite subjugate
d.  So accordi
ng to history it
 has been found 
from the most an
"cient times,
an"
d so it is to ou
r own day. All N
apoleon’s wars
 serve to confir
m this rule. In
 proportion to t
he defeat of the
 Austrian army A
ustria loses it
"s rights, and th"
e rights and the
 strength of Fra
nce increase. Th
e victories of 
the French at Je
na and Auerstäd
t destroy the in
dependent exist
ence of Prussia.
"

But then, in"
" 1812, the Frenc"
h gain a victory
 near Moscow. Mo
scow is taken a
"nd after that, w"
ith no further b
"attles, it is no"
t Russia that c
"eases to exist, "
but the French a
rmy of six hundr
"ed thousand, and"
 then Napoleoni
c France itself.
 To strain the f
acts to fit the 
rules of histor
y: to say that t
he field of batt
le at Borodinó 
remained in the 
 hands of the Ru
"ssians, or that "
after Moscow the
re were other ba
ttles that dest
royed Napoleon�
"�s army, is impo"
ssible.  After
 the French vict
ory at Borodinó
 there was no ge
neral engagement
 nor any that w
ere at all serio
"us, yet the Fren"
ch army ceased t
o exist. What d
oes this mean? I
f it were an exa
mple taken from 
the history of C
"hina,
we might "
say that it was 
not an historic 
phenomenon (whic
h is the histor
ians’ usual ex
pedient when any
thing does not f
it their standar
ds); if the mat
ter concerned so
me brief conflic
t in which only 
a small number 
of troops took p
"art, we might tr"
eat it as an exc
eption; but this
 event occurred
 before our fath
"ers’ eyes, and"
 for them it was
 a question of t
he life or deat
h of their fathe
"rland, and it ha"
ppened in the gr
eatest of all k
nown wars.  Th
e period of the 
campaign of 1812
 from the battle
 of Borodinó to
 the expulsion 
of the French pr
oved that the wi
nning of a battl
e does not prod
uce a conquest a
nd is not even a
n invariable ind
ication of conqu
est; it proved 
that the force w
hich decides the
 fate of peoples
 lies not in th
"e conquerors, no"
r even in armies
" and battles, bu"
t in something e
lse.  The Fren
"ch historians, d"
escribing the co
ndition of the F
rench army befo
re it left Mosco
"w, affirm that a"
ll was in order 
in the Grand Arm
"y,
except the c"
"avalry, the arti"
"llery, and the t"
ransport—there
 was no forage 
for the horses o
r the cattle. Th
at was a misfort
une no one could
" remedy,
for th"
e peasants of th
e district burne
d their hay rath
er than let the 
 French have it.
  The victory 
gained did not b
ring the usual r
esults because t
he peasants Kar
p and Vlas (who 
after the French
 had evacuated M
oscow drove in t
heir carts to p
"illage the town,"
 and in general 
personally faile
d to manifest a
ny heroic feelin
"gs), and the who"
le innumerable m
ultitude of such
"
peasants, did "
not bring their 
hay to Moscow fo
r the high price
" offered
them, "
but burned it in
stead.  Let us
 imagine two men
 who have come o
ut to fight a du
el with rapiers 
 according to al
l the rules of t
he art of fencin
g. The fencing h
as gone on for 
some time; sudde
nly one of the c
"ombatants, feeli"
ng himself woun
ded and understa
nding that the m
atter is no joke
 but concerns hi
"s
life, throws "
"down his rapier,"
 and seizing the
 first cudgel th
at comes to han
d begins to bran
dish it. Then le
t us imagine tha
t the combatant 
who so sensibly
 employed the be
st and simplest 
means to attain 
his end was at 
the same time in
fluenced by trad
itions of chival
"ry and, desiring"
 to conceal the
 facts of the ca
"se, insisted tha"
t he had gained 
his victory wit
h the rapier acc
ording to all th
e rules of art. 
One can imagine 
what confusion 
and obscurity wo
uld result from 
such an account 
of the duel.  
The fencer who d
emanded a contes
t according to t
he rules of fenc
ing was the Fre
nch army; his op
ponent who threw
 away the rapier
 and snatched up
 the cudgel was
 the Russian peo
ple; those who t
ry to explain th
e matter accord
ing to the rules
 of fencing are 
the historians w
ho have describe
d the event.  
 After the burni
ng of Smolénsk 
a war began whic
h did not follow
 any previous t
raditions of war
. The burning of
 towns and villa
"ges, the
retrea"
ts after battles
", the blow dealt"
 at Borodinó an
d the renewed r
"etreat, the burn"
"ing of Moscow, t"
he capture of ma
"rauders, the sei"
zure of transpo
"rts, and the gue"
rrilla war were 
all departures f
rom the rules. 
 Napoleon felt 
"this, and from t"
he time he took 
up the correct f
encing attitude
 in Moscow and i
nstead of his op
ponent’s rapie
r saw a cudgel 
raised above his
" head, he did no"
t cease to compl
ain to Kutúzov 
and to the Empe
ror Alexander th
at the war was b
eing carried on 
contrary to all 
 the rules—as 
if there were an
y rules for kill
ing people. In s
pite of the com
plaints of the F
rench as to the 
nonobservance of
" the rules, in
"
spite of the fac
t that to some h
ighly placed Rus
sians it seemed 
rather disgrace
ful to fight wit
h a cudgel and t
hey wanted to as
sume a pose en 
quarte or en tie
rce according to
" all the rules, "
and to make an a
droit thrust en
" prime, and so o"
n—the cudgel o
f the people’s
 war was lifted 
 with all its me
nacing and majes
"tic strength, an"
d without consul
ting anyone’s
 tastes or rules
 and regardless 
of anything else
", it rose and
f"
ell with stupid 
"simplicity, but "
"consistently, an"
d belabored the 
French till the
 whole invasion 
had perished.  
 And it is well 
for a people who
 do not—as the
 French did in 1
813—salute ac
cording to all t
"he rules of art,"
" and, presenting"
 the hilt of the
ir rapier grace
fully and polite
"ly, hand it to t"
heir magnanimous
" conqueror,
but"
 at the moment o
"f trial, without"
 asking what rul
es others have 
adopted in simil
"ar cases, simply"
 and easily pick
 up the first cu
dgel that comes
 to hand and str
ike with it till
 the feeling of 
resentment and 
revenge in their
 soul yields to 
a feeling of con
tempt and compas
sion.      
 CHAPTER II  O
ne of the most o
bvious and advan
tageous departur
es from the so-c
alled laws of w
ar is the action
 of scattered gr
oups against men
 pressed togeth
er in a mass. Su
ch action always
 occurs in wars 
that take on a 
national charact
er. In such acti
"ons, instead of "
two crowds oppos
"ing
each other,"
 the men dispers
"e, attack singly"
", run away when "
attacked by str
"onger forces, bu"
t again attack w
hen opportunity 
offers. This was
 done by the gu
errillas in Spai
"n, by the mounta"
in tribes in the
" Caucasus, and
"
by the Russians 
in 1812.  Peop
le have called t
his kind of war 
“guerrilla war
fare” and assu
me that by so c
alling it they h
ave explained it
s meaning. But s
uch a war does 
not fit in under
 any rule and is
 directly oppose
d to a well-know
n rule of tacti
cs which is acce
pted as infallib
le. That rule sa
ys that an atta
cker should conc
entrate his forc
es in order to b
e stronger than 
his opponent at
 the moment of c
onflict.  Guer
rilla war (alway
"s successful, as"
 history shows) 
directly infring
es that rule. 
 This contradic
tion arises from
 the fact that m
ilitary science 
assumes the str
ength of an army
 to be identical
 with its number
s. Military sci
ence says that t
he more troops t
he greater the s
trength. Les gro
s bataillons on
t toujours raiso
n. *      * La
rge battalions a
re always victor
ious.  For mil
itary science to
 say this is lik
e defining momen
tum in mechanics
 by reference t
o the mass only:
 stating that mo
menta are equal 
or unequal to e
ach other simply
 because the mas
ses involved are
 equal or unequa
l.  Momentum (
quantity of moti
on) is the produ
ct of mass and v
elocity.  In m
ilitary affairs 
the strength of 
an army is the p
roduct of its ma
ss and some unk
nown x.  Milit
"ary science, see"
ing in history i
nnumerable insta
nces of the fact
 that the size 
of any army does
 not coincide wi
th its strength 
and that small 
detachments defe
"at larger ones, "
obscurely admits
 the existence 
of this unknown 
factor and tries
 to discover it�
��now in a geome
"tric
formation,"
 now in the equi
"pment employed, "
"now, and most us"
"ually, in the
g"
enius of the com
manders. But the
 assignment of t
hese various mea
nings to the fa
ctor does not yi
eld results whic
h accord with th
e historic fact
s.  Yet it is 
only necessary t
o abandon the fa
lse view (adopte
d to gratify th
e “heroes”) 
of the efficacy 
of the direction
s issued in wart
ime by commande
"rs, in order to "
find this unknow
n quantity.  T
hat unknown quan
tity is the spir
"it of the army, "
"that is to say, "
the greater or 
lesser readiness
 to fight and fa
ce danger felt b
y all the men c
omposing an army
", quite independ"
ently of whether
" they are, or ar"
"e not,
fighting"
 under the comma
"nd of a genius, "
in two—or thre
e-line formation
",
with cudgels "
or with rifles t
hat repeat thirt
y times a minute
. Men who want 
to fight will al
ways put themsel
ves in the most 
advantageous co
nditions for fig
hting.  The sp
irit of an army 
is the factor wh
ich multiplied b
y the mass gives
 the resulting 
force. To define
 and express the
 significance of
 this unknown f
actor—the spir
it of an army—
is a problem for
 science.  Thi
s problem is onl
y solvable if we
 cease arbitrari
ly to substitute
 for the unknow
n x itself the c
onditions under 
which that force
 becomes appare
nt—such as the
 commands of the
" general, the eq"
uipment employed
",
and so on—m"
istaking these f
or the real sign
ificance of the 
"factor,
and if "
we recognize thi
s unknown quanti
ty in its entire
ty as being the
 greater or less
er desire to fig
ht and to face d
anger. Only then
",
expressing kn"
own historic fac
ts by equations 
and comparing th
e relative sign
ificance of this
" factor, can we "
hope to define t
he unknown.  T
"en men, battalio"
"ns, or divisions"

"en men, battalio"
"ns, or
division"
"s, conquer—tha"
"t is, kill or ta"
ke captive—all
" the others, whi"
le themselves l
"osing four, so t"
hat on the one s
ide four and on 
the other fifte
en were lost. Co
nsequently the f
our were equal t
"o the fifteen, a"
nd therefore 4x
 = 15y. Conseque
ntly x/y = 15/4.
 This equation d
oes not give us
 the value of th
e unknown factor
 but gives us a 
ratio between tw
o unknowns. And
 by bringing var
iously selected 
historic units (
"battles,
campai"
"gns, periods of "
war) into such e
"quations, a seri"
es of numbers c
ould be obtained
 in which certai
n laws should ex
ist and might be
 discovered.  
 The tactical ru
le that an army 
should act in ma
sses when attack
"ing, and
in sma"
ller groups in r
"etreat, unconsci"
ously confirms t
he truth that th
e strength of a
n army depends o
n its spirit. To
 lead men forwar
d under fire mo
re discipline (o
btainable only b
y movement in ma
sses) is needed 
 than is needed 
to resist attack
s. But this rule
 which leaves ou
t of account th
e spirit of the 
army continually
 proves incorrec
t and is in par
ticularly striki
ng contrast to t
he facts when so
me strong rise o
r fall in the s
pirit of the tro
"ops occurs, as i"
n all national w
ars.  The Fren
"ch, retreating i"
n 1812—though 
according to tac
tics they should
 have separated
 into detachment
s to defend them
selves—congreg
ated into a mas
s because the sp
irit of the army
 had so fallen t
hat only the mas
s held the army
 together. The R
"ussians, on the "
"contrary, ought "
according to ta
ctics to have at
"tacked in mass, "
but in fact they
 split up into 
"small units, bec"
ause their spiri
t had so risen t
hat separate in
"dividuals, witho"
"ut orders, dealt"
 blows at the Fr
ench without nee
ding any compul
sion to induce t
hem to expose th
emselves to hard
ships and dange
rs.      C
HAPTER III  Th
e so-called part
isan war began w
ith the entry of
 the French into
 Smolénsk.  
Before partisan 
warfare had been
 officially reco
gnized by the g
"overnment, thous"
ands of enemy st
"ragglers, maraud"
"ers, and forager"
s had been dest
royed by the Cos
sacks and the pe
"asants, who kill"
ed them off as 
instinctively as
 dogs worry a st
ray mad dog to d
eath. Denís Dav
"ýdov,
with his"
 Russian instinc
"t, was the first"
 to recognize th
e value of this
 terrible cudgel
 which regardles
s of the rules o
f military scien
ce destroyed th
"e French, and to"
 him belongs the
 credit for taki
ng the first st
ep toward regula
rizing this meth
od of warfare. 
 On August 24 D
avýdov’s firs
t partisan detac
hment was formed
 and then other
s were recognize
d. The further t
he campaign prog
ressed the more 
 numerous these 
detachments beca
me.  The irreg
ulars destroyed 
the great army p
iecemeal. They g
athered the fal
len leaves that 
dropped of thems
elves from that 
withered tree—
the French army
—and sometimes
 shook that tree
 itself. By Octo
"ber, when
the F"
rench were fleei
ng toward Smolé
"nsk, there were "
hundreds of such
"
companies, of "
various sizes an
d characters. Th
ere were some th
at adopted all 
the army methods
 and had infantr
"y, artillery, st"
"affs, and the
c"
omforts of life.
 Others consiste
d solely of Coss
ack cavalry. The
re were also sm
all scratch grou
ps of foot and h
"orse, and groups"
 of peasants and
 landowners tha
t remained unkno
wn. A sacristan 
commanded one pa
rty which captu
red several hund
red prisoners in
 the course of a
 month; and ther
e was Vasílisa
", the wife of a "
"village elder, w"
ho slew hundreds
 of the French.
  The partisan
 warfare flamed 
up most fiercely
 in the latter d
ays of October.
 Its first perio
d had passed: wh
en the partisans
" themselves,
am"
azed at their ow
"n boldness, fear"
ed every minute 
to be surrounded
 and captured b
"y the French, an"
d hid in the for
ests without uns
"addling,
hardly"
 daring to dismo
unt and always e
xpecting to be p
ursued. By the e
nd of October t
his kind of warf
are had taken de
finite shape: it
 had become cle
ar to all what c
ould be ventured
 against the Fre
nch and what cou
ld not. Now onl
y the commanders
 of detachments 
"with staffs, and"
 moving accordi
ng to rules at a
 distance from t
"he French, still"
 regarded many 
things as imposs
ible. The small 
bands that had s
tarted their act
ivities long be
fore and had alr
eady observed th
e French closely
 considered thi
ngs possible whi
ch the commander
s of the big det
achments did not
 dare to contem
plate. The Cossa
cks and peasants
 who crept in am
ong the French 
now considered e
verything possib
le.  On Octobe
"r 22, Denísov ("
who was one of t
he irregulars) w
as with his gro
up at the height
 of the guerrill
a enthusiasm. Si
nce early mornin
g he and his pa
rty had been on 
the move. All da
y long he had be
en watching fro
m the forest tha
t skirted the hi
ghroad a large F
rench convoy of 
 cavalry baggage
 and Russian pri
soners separated
 from the rest o
"f the
army, whi"
ch—as was lear
ned from spies a
nd prisoners—w
as moving under 
a strong escort
 to Smolénsk. B
esides Denísov 
and Dólokhov (w
ho also led a s
mall party and m
oved in Denísov
"’s vicinity), "
the commanders o
f some large di
visions with sta
ffs also knew of
 this convoy and
", as Denísov
e"
"xpressed it, wer"
e sharpening the
ir teeth for it.
 Two of the comm
anders of large
 parties—one a
 Pole and the ot
her a German—s
ent invitations 
 to Denísov alm
ost simultaneous
"ly, requesting h"
im to join up wi
th their divisi
ons to attack th
e convoy.  “
"No, bwother, I h"
ave gwown mustac
"hes myself,” s"
aid Denísov on 
reading these d
"ocuments, and he"
 wrote to the Ge
"rman that, despi"
te his heartfelt
 desire to serv
e under so valia
nt and renowned 
"a general, he ha"
d to forgo that
 pleasure becaus
e he was already
 under the comma
nd of the Polish
 general. To th
e Polish general
 he replied to t
"he same effect, "
informing him t
hat he was alrea
dy under the com
mand of the Germ
an.  Having ar
ranged matters t
"hus, Denísov an"
d Dólokhov inte
"nded, without
r"
eporting matters
 to the higher c
"ommand, to attac"
k and seize that
 convoy with th
eir own small fo
rces. On October
 22 it was movin
g from the vill
age of Mikúlino
 to that of Shá
mshevo. To the l
eft of the road 
 between Mikúli
no and Shámshev
o there were lar
"ge forests, exte"
nding in some p
laces up to the 
road itself thou
gh in others a m
ile or more back
 from it. Throu
gh these forests
 Denísov and hi
s party rode all
" day,
sometimes"
 keeping well ba
ck in them and s
ometimes coming 
to the very edg
"e, but never los"
ing sight of the
 moving French. 
"That morning,
C"
ossacks of Dení
sov’s party ha
d seized and car
ried off into th
e forest two wa
gons loaded with
 cavalry saddles
", which had stuc"
k in the mud not
 far from Mikú
lino where the f
orest ran close 
to the road. Sin
"ce then,
and un"
"til evening, the"
 party had watch
ed the movements
 of the French 
without attackin
g. It was necess
ary to let the F
rench reach Shá
mshevo quietly 
without alarming
" them and then, "
after joining D�
�lokhov who was 
 to come that ev
ening to a consu
ltation at a wat
chman’s hut in
 the forest les
s than a mile fr
"om Shámshevo, t"
o surprise the F
"rench at dawn, f"
alling like an 
avalanche on the
ir heads from tw
"o sides, and rou"
t and capture t
hem all at one b
low.  In their
" rear, more than"
 a mile from Mik
úlino where the
 forest came ri
ght up to the ro
"ad, six Cossacks"
 were posted to 
report if any fr
esh columns of 
French should sh
ow themselves. 
 Beyond Shámsh
"evo, Dólokhov w"
as to observe th
e road in the sa
"me way, to
find"
 out at what dis
tance there were
 other French tr
oops. They recko
ned that the co
nvoy had fifteen
 hundred men. De
nísov had two h
"undred, and
Dó"
lokhov might hav
"e as many more, "
but the disparit
y of numbers did
 not deter Den�
�sov. All that h
e now wanted to 
know was what tr
oops these were 
 and to learn th
at he had to cap
ture a “tongue
"”—that is, a"
 man from the e
nemy column. Tha
t morning’s at
tack on the wago
ns had been made
 so hastily tha
t the Frenchmen 
with the wagons 
had all been kil
led; only a lit
tle drummer boy 
had been taken a
"live, and as he "
was a straggler 
he could tell t
hem nothing defi
nite about the t
roops in that co
lumn.  Deníso
v considered it 
dangerous to mak
e a second attac
k for fear of p
utting the whole
 column on the a
"lert, so he sent"
 Tíkhon Shcherb
"áty, a
peasant"
" of his party, t"
o Shámshevo to 
try and seize at
 least one of th
e French quarte
rmasters who had
 been sent on in
 advance.    
   CHAPTER IV 
  It was a warm
 rainy autumn da
y. The sky and t
he horizon were 
both the color 
of muddy water. 
At times a sort 
of mist descende
"d, and then
sud"
denly heavy slan
ting rain came d
own.  Denísov
 in a felt cloak
 and a sheepskin
 cap from which 
the rain ran dow
n was riding a 
thin thoroughbre
d horse with sun
ken sides. Like 
"his horse,
whic"
h turned its hea
d and laid its e
"ars back, he shr"
ank from the dri
ving rain and g
azed anxiously b
efore him. His t
hin face with it
"s short, thick
"
black beard look
ed angry.  Bes
ide Denísov rod
"e an esaul, * De"
nísov’s fello
"w worker, also i"
n felt cloak an
"d sheepskin cap,"
 and riding a la
rge sleek Don ho
rse.      * A 
captain of Cossa
cks.  Esaul Lo
váyski the Thir
d was a tall man
 as straight as 
"an arrow,
pale-"
"faced, fair-hair"
"ed, with narrow "
light eyes and w
ith calm self-s
atisfaction in h
is face and bear
ing. Though it w
as impossible to
 say in what th
e peculiarity of
 the horse and r
"ider lay, yet at"
 first glance a
t the esaul and 
Denísov one saw
 that the latter
 was wet and un
comfortable and 
was a man mounte
"d on a horse, wh"
ile looking at t
he esaul one sa
w that he was as
 comfortable and
 as much at ease
 as always and 
that he was not 
a man who had mo
"unted a horse, b"
ut a man who was
 one with his h
"orse, a being co"
nsequently posse
ssed of twofold 
strength.  A l
ittle ahead of t
hem walked a pea
"sant guide, wet "
to the skin and 
 wearing a gray 
peasant coat and
 a white knitted
 cap.  A littl
"e behind, on a p"
"oor, small, lean"
 Kirghíz mount 
with an enormous
 tail and mane 
and a bleeding m
"outh, rode a you"
ng officer in a 
blue French ove
rcoat.  Beside
 him rode an hus
"sar, with a boy "
in a tattered Fr
ench uniform and
 blue cap behin
d him on the cru
pper of his hors
e. The boy held 
on to the hussa
"r with cold, red"
" hands, and rais"
ing his eyebrows
 gazed about him
 with surprise.
 This was the Fr
ench drummer boy
 captured that m
orning.  Behin
d them along the
" narrow, sodden,"
 cut up forest r
oad came hussars
 in threes and 
"fours, and then "
Cossacks: some i
"n felt cloaks, s"
ome in French g
"reatcoats, and s"
ome with horsecl
oths over their 
heads. The horse
"s,
being drench"
"ed by the rain, "
all looked black
 whether chestnu
t or bay. Their
" necks, with the"
"ir wet, close-cl"
"inging manes, lo"
oked strangely 
thin. Steam rose
 from them. Clot
"hes, saddles, re"
"ins, were all we"
"t,
slippery, an"
"d sodden, like t"
he ground and th
e fallen leaves 
that strewed th
e road. The men 
sat huddled up t
rying not to sti
"r, so as to warm"
 the water that
 had trickled to
 their bodies an
d not admit the 
fresh cold wate
r that was leaki
ng in under thei
"r seats, their k"
"nees, and at the"
 back of their 
necks. In the mi
dst of the outsp
read line of Cos
sacks two wagon
"s, drawn by Fren"
ch horses and by
 saddled Cossack
 horses that had
 been hitched o
"n in front, rumb"
led over the tre
e stumps and bra
nches and splas
hed through the 
water that lay i
n the ruts.  D
enísov’s hors
e swerved aside 
to avoid a pool 
in the track and
 bumped his rid
er’s knee agai
nst a tree.  �
"��Oh, the devil!"
” exclaimed De
"nísov angrily, "
and showing his 
teeth he struck
 his horse three
 times with his 
"whip, splashing "
himself and his 
 comrades with m
ud.  Denísov 
was out of sorts
 both because of
 the rain and al
so from hunger 
(none of them ha
d eaten anything
" since morning),"
 and yet more be
cause he still 
had no news from
 Dólokhov and t
he man sent to c
apture a “tong
ue” had not r
eturned.  “T
here’ll hardly
 be another such
 chance to fall 
on a transport a
s today. It’s
 too risky to at
tack them by one
"self, and if we "
put it off till 
 another day one
 of the big guer
rilla detachment
s will snatch th
e prey from und
"er our noses,”"
 thought Deníso
"v, continually p"
"eering forward,"
 hoping to see a
 messenger from 
Dólokhov.  On
 coming to a pat
h in the forest 
along which he c
ould see far to 
"the
right, Den�"
�sov stopped.  
 “There’s so
"meone coming,”"
 said he.  The
 esaul looked in
 the direction D
enísov indicate
d.  “There a
"re two, an offic"
er and a Cossack
. But it is not 
presupposable t
hat it is the li
eutenant colonel
" himself,” sai"
"d the esaul, who"
 was fond of us
ing words the Co
ssacks did not k
now.  The appr
oaching riders h
aving descended 
a decline were n
o longer visibl
"e, but they reap"
peared a few min
utes later. In f
"ront, at a weary"
 gallop and usi
ng his leather w
"hip, rode an off"
"icer, disheveled"
" and
drenched, "
whose trousers h
ad worked up to 
above his knees.
" Behind him,
st"
anding in the st
"irrups, trotted "
a Cossack. The o
"fficer, a very y"
oung lad with a
 broad rosy face
 and keen merry 
"eyes, galloped u"
p to Denísov a
nd handed him a 
sodden envelope.
  “From the 
"general,” said"
 the officer. �
�Please excuse i
ts not being qui
te dry.”  D
"enísov, frownin"
"g, took the enve"
lope and opened 
"it.

“There,"
 they kept telli
ng us: ‘It’s
" dangerous, it�"
"�s dangerous,’"
” said the of
"ficer, addressin"
g the esaul whil
e Denísov was r
eading the disp
atch. “But Kom
aróv and I”�
�he pointed to t
he Cossack—“
were prepared. 
We have each of 
us two pistols..
.. But what’s 
this?” he aske
"d, noticing
the"
 French drummer 
boy. “A prison
er? You’ve alr
eady been in act
ion? May I spea
k to him?”  
“Wostóv! Pét
ya!” exclaimed
" Denísov, havin"
g run through th
e dispatch. “
Why didn’t you
 say who you wer
e?” and turnin
g with a smile h
e held out his 
hand to the lad.
  The officer 
was Pétya Rost�
�v.  All the w
ay Pétya had be
en preparing him
self to behave w
ith Denísov as 
 befitted a grow
n-up man and an 
officer—withou
t hinting at the
ir previous acq
uaintance. But a
s soon as Denís
ov smiled at him
 Pétya brighten
"ed
up, blushed "
"with pleasure, f"
orgot the offici
al manner he had
 been rehearsin
"g, and began tel"
ling him how he 
had already been
 in a battle ne
ar Vyázma and h
ow a certain hus
sar had distingu
ished himself th
"ere.

“Well,"
 I am glad to se
"e you,” Denís"
ov interrupted h
"im, and his face"
 again assumed 
its anxious expr
ession.  “Mi
chael Feoklítyc
"h,” said he to"
" the esaul, “t"
his is again fwo
"m that
German, "
you know. He”�
��he indicated P
étya—“is se
rving under him.
”  And Dení
sov told the esa
ul that the disp
atch just delive
red was a repet
ition of the Ger
man general’s 
demand that he s
hould join force
s with him for 
an attack on the
 transport.  �
��If we don’t 
take it tomowwow
", he’ll snatch"
 it fwom under o
"ur noses,” he"
 added.  While
 Denísov was ta
lking to the esa
"ul, Pétya—aba"
shed by Denísov
’s cold tone 
and supposing th
at it was due to
 the condition o
f his trousers�
��furtively trie
d to pull them d
own under his gr
eatcoat so that
 no one should n
"otice it, while "
maintaining as m
artial an air as
 possible.  �
��Will there be 
"any orders, your"
 honor?” he as
"ked Denísov, ho"
lding his hand 
at the salute an
d resuming the g
ame of adjutant 
and general for 
 which he had pr
"epared himself, "
“or shall I re
main with your h
onor?”  “O
rders?” Denís
ov repeated thou
ghtfully. “But
 can you stay ti
ll tomowwow?”
"

“Oh, pleas"
e... May I stay 
with you?” cri
ed Pétya.  �
"�But, just what "
did the genewal 
tell you? To wet
urn at once?” 
asked Denísov.
  Pétya blush
ed.  “He gav
e me no instruct
ions. I think I 
could?” he ret
"urned, inquiring"
"ly.

“Well, "
"all wight,” sa"
id Denísov.  
And turning to h
is men he direct
ed a party to go
 on to the halti
ng place arrang
ed near the watc
hman’s hut in 
"the forest, and "
told the officer
 on the Kirghí
z horse (who per
formed the dutie
s of an adjutant
) to go and fin
d out where Dól
okhov was and wh
ether he would c
ome that evening
. Denísov hims
elf intended goi
ng with the esau
l and Pétya to 
the edge of the
 forest where it
 reached out to 
"Shámshevo, to h"
ave a look at th
e part of the F
rench bivouac th
ey were to attac
k next day.  �
"��Well, old fell"
"ow,” said he t"
o the peasant gu
"ide, “lead us "
to Shámshevo.�
"��

Denísov, "
"Pétya, and the "
"esaul, accompani"
ed by some Cossa
cks and the hus
sar who had the 
"prisoner, rode t"
o the left acros
s a ravine to th
e edge of the f
orest.     
 CHAPTER V  T
he rain had stop
"ped, and only th"
e mist was falli
ng and drops fro
m the trees. De
"nísov, the esau"
"l, and Pétya ro"
"de silently, fol"
lowing the peas
ant in the knitt
"ed cap who, step"
ping lightly wit
h outturned toes
 and moving noi

tly led them to 
the edge of the 
forest.  He as
cended an inclin
"e, stopped, look"
"ed about him, an"
d advanced to wh
ere the screen 
of trees was les
s dense. On reac
hing a large oak
 tree that had 
not yet shed its
" leaves, he stop"
ped and beckoned
 mysteriously to
 them with his 
hand.  Deníso
v and Pétya rod
e up to him. Fro
m the spot where
 the peasant was
 standing they 
could see the Fr
ench. Immediatel
y beyond the for
"est, on a
downw"
"ard slope, lay a"
 field of spring
 rye. To the rig
"ht, beyond a ste"
"ep
ravine, was "
a small village 
and a landowner�
��s house with a
 broken roof. I
"n the village, i"
"n the house, in "
"the garden, by t"
"he well, by the "
"pond,
over all "
the rising groun
"d, and all along"
 the road uphill
 from the bridg
e leading to the
" village, not mo"
re than five hun
dred yards away
", crowds of men "
could be seen th
rough the shimme
ring mist. Their
 un-Russian sho
uting at their h
orses which were
 straining uphil
l with the cart
"s, and their cal"
ls to one anothe
"r, could be clea"
rly heard.  �
�Bwing the priso
"ner here,” sai"
d Denísov in a 
"low voice, not t"
aking his eyes 
off the French. 
  A Cossack dis
"mounted, lifted "
"the boy down, an"
d took him to De
nísov. Pointin
g to the French 
"troops, Denísov"
 asked him what 
these and those 
 of them were. T
"he boy, thrustin"
g his cold hands
 into his pocket
s and lifting h
"is eyebrows, loo"
ked at Denísov 
"in affright, but"
 in spite of an
 evident desire 
to say all he kn
ew gave confused
" answers, merely"
 assenting to e
verything Denís
ov asked him. De
nísov turned aw
ay from him fro
wning and addres
"sed the esaul, c"
onveying his own
 conjectures to 
"him.

Pétya, "
rapidly turning 
"his head, looked"
 now at the drum
"mer boy, now
at"
" Denísov, now a"
"t the esaul, and"
 now at the Fren
ch in the villag
e and along the
" road, trying no"
t to miss anythi
ng of importance
.  “Whether 
Dólokhov comes 
"or not, we must "
"seize it, eh?”"
 said Denísov w
ith a merry spa
rkle in his eyes
.  “It is a 
very suitable sp
"ot,” said the "
esaul.  “We�
��ll send the in
fantwy down by t
"he swamps,” De"
nísov continued
. “They’ll 
cweep up to the 
garden; you’ll
 wide up fwom th
ere with the Co

�� said the esau
l. “The horse

ing in undertone
s the crack of a
 shot sounded f
rom the low grou
"nd by the pond, "
a puff of white 
"smoke appeared, "
"then
another, a"
nd the sound of 
hundreds of seem
ingly merry Fren
ch voices shout
ing together cam
e up from the sl
ope. For a momen
t Denísov and t
he esaul drew b
ack. They were s
o near that they
 thought they we
re the cause of
 the firing and 
shouting. But th
e firing and sho
uting did not re
late to them. D
"own below, a man"
 wearing somethi
ng red was runni
ng through the 
marsh. The Frenc
h were evidently
 firing and shou
ting at him.  
"“Why, that’s"
" our Tíkhon,”"
 said the esaul.
  “So it is!
 It is!”  �
�The wascal!” 
said Denísov. 
 “He’ll get
 away!” said t
"he esaul, screwi"
ng up his eyes. 
  The man whom 
they called Tík
"hon, having run "
"to the stream, p"
lunged in so th
at the water spl
ashed in the air
", and, having di"
sappeared for an
"
instant, scram"
bled out on all 
"fours, all black"
" with the wet, a"
nd ran on. The 
French who had b
een pursuing him
 stopped.  “
"Smart, that!” "
said the esaul. 
  “What a bea
st!” said Den�
�sov with his fo
rmer look of vex
ation. “What h
as he been doin
g all this time?
”  “Who is
 he?” asked P�
�tya.  “He�
�s our plastún.
 I sent him to c
apture a ‘tong
ue.’”  “
"Oh, yes,” said"
" Pétya, nodding"
 at the first wo
rds Denísov utt
ered as if he u
nderstood it all
", though he real"
ly did not under
stand anything o
f it.  Tíkho
n Shcherbáty wa
s one of the mos
t indispensable 
men in their ban
d. He was a pea
sant from Pokró
"vsk, near the ri"
ver Gzhat. When 
Denísov had co
me to Pokróvsk 
at the beginning
 of his operatio
ns and had as us
ual summoned th
e village elder 
and asked him wh
at he knew about
" the French,
th"
"e elder, as thou"
gh shielding him
"self, had replie"
"d, as all villag"
"e
elders did, t"
hat he had neith
er seen nor hear
d anything of th
em. But when De
nísov explained
 that his purpos
e was to kill th
"e French, and
a"
sked if no Frenc
h had strayed th
"at way, the elde"
r replied that s
ome “more-ord
erers” had rea
lly been at thei
"r village, but t"
hat Tíkhon Shc
herbáty was the
 only man who de
alt with such ma
tters. Denísov 
had Tíkhon cal
"led and, having "
praised him for 
"his activity, sa"
id a few words 
in the elder’s
 presence about 
loyalty to the T
sar and the coun
try and the hat
red of the Frenc
h that all sons 
of the fatherlan
d should cherish
.  “We don�
�t do the French
" any harm,” sa"
"id Tíkhon, evid"
ently frightened
 by Denísov’
s words. “We o
nly fooled about
 with the lads f
"or fun, you know"
! We killed a s
core or so of �
"�more-orderers,�"
�� but we did no
 harm else....�
�  Next day wh
en Denísov had 
"left Pokróvsk, "
having quite for
gotten about th
"is peasant, it w"
as reported to h
im that Tíkhon 
had attached him
self to their p
arty and asked t
o be allowed to 
remain with it. 
Denísov gave o
rders to let him
 do so.  Tíkh
"on, who at first"
" did rough work,"
 laying campfire
"s, fetching wate"
"r,
flaying dead"
" horses, and so "
"on, soon showed "
a great liking a
nd aptitude for
 partisan warfar
e. At night he w
ould go out for 
booty and always
 brought back F
rench clothing a
"nd weapons, and "
when told to wou
ld bring in Fre
nch captives als
o. Denísov then
 relieved him fr
om drudgery and 
 began taking hi
m with him when 
he went out on e
xpeditions and h
ad him enrolled
 among the Cossa
cks.  Tíkhon 
did not like rid
"ing, and always "
"went on foot, ne"
ver lagging beh
ind the cavalry.
 He was armed wi
th a musketoon (
which he carried
 rather as a jo
"ke), a pike and "
"an ax, which lat"
ter he used as a
 wolf uses its 
"teeth, with equa"
l ease picking f
leas out of its 
fur or crunching
 thick bones. T
íkhon with equa
l accuracy would
 split logs with
 blows at arm�
"�s length, or ho"
lding the head o
f the ax would c
ut thin little p
egs or carve sp
oons. In Deníso
v’s party he h
eld a peculiar a
nd exceptional 
position. When a
nything particul
arly difficult o
r nasty had to b
e done—to pus
h a cart out of 
the mud with one
"’s shoulders, "
pull a horse ou
t of a swamp by 
"its tail, skin i"
"t, slink in amon"
"g the French, or"
 walk more than
 thirty miles in
 a day—everybo
dy pointed laugh
ingly at Tíkhon
.  “It won�
�t hurt that dev
il—he’s as s
trong as a horse
!” they said o
f him.  Once a
 Frenchman Tíkh
on was trying to
 capture fired a
 pistol at him 
and shot him in 
the fleshy part 
of the back. Tha
t wound (which T
íkhon treated 
only with intern
al and external 
applications of 
vodka) was the 
subject of the l
iveliest jokes b
y the whole deta
chment—jokes i
n which Tíkhon
 readily joined.
"

“Hallo, ma"
te! Never again?
 Gave you a twis
t?” the Cossac
ks would banter 
 him. And Tíkho
"n, purposely wri"
thing and making
" faces, pretende"
d to be angry a
nd swore at the 
French with the 
funniest curses.
 The only effect
 of this incide
nt on Tíkhon wa
s that after bei
ng wounded he se
ldom brought in
 prisoners.  H
e was the braves
t and most usefu
l man in the par
ty. No one found
 more opportuni
ties for attacki
"ng, no one captu"
red or killed mo
"re Frenchmen,
a"
nd consequently 
he was made the 
buffoon of all t
he Cossacks and 
hussars and wil
lingly accepted 
that role. Now h
e had been sent 
by Denísov ove
rnight to Sháms
hevo to capture 
a “tongue.” 
But whether beca
use he had not 
been content to 
take only one Fr
enchman or becau
se he had slept 
 through the nig
"ht, he had crept"
 by day into som
e bushes right a
mong the French
" and, as Deníso"
v had witnessed 
"from above, had "
been detected by
 them.     
  CHAPTER VI  
 After talking f
or some time wit
h the esaul abou
t next day’s a
"ttack,
which no"
"w, seeing how ne"
ar they were to 
"the French, he s"
eemed to have d
efinitely decide

urned his horse 
and rode back. 
"
“Now, my lad"
", we’ll go and"
" get dwy,” he "
said to Pétya. 
  As they appro
ached the watchh
ouse Denísov st
"opped, peering i"
nto the forest.
 Among the trees
 a man with long
" legs and long, "
"swinging arms,
"
wearing a short 
"jacket, bast sho"
"es, and a Kazán"
" hat, was approa"
ching with long
", light steps. H"
e had a musketoo
n over his shoul
der and an ax s
tuck in his gird
le. When he espi
ed Denísov he h
astily threw som
ething into the
" bushes, removed"
 his sodden hat 
by its floppy br
"im, and
approac"
hed his commande
r. It was Tíkho
n. His wrinkled 
and pockmarked 
face and narrow 
little eyes beam
ed with self-sat
isfied merriment
. He lifted his
 head high and g
azed at Denísov
 as if repressin
g a laugh.  �
"�Well, where did"
 you disappear t
o?” inquired D
enísov.  “W
here did I disap
pear to? I went 
to get Frenchmen
",” answered T�"
�khon boldly an
"d hurriedly, in "
a husky but melo
dious bass voice
.  “Why did 
you push yoursel
f in there by da
ylight? You ass!
" Well, why
have"
n’t you taken 
one?”  “Oh
", I took one all"
" right,” said "
Tíkhon.  “W
here is he?” 
"
“You see, I "
took him first t
"hing at dawn,”"
 Tíkhon continu
"ed, spreading
o"
ut his flat feet
 with outturned 
toes in their ba
st shoes. “I t
ook him into th
e forest. Then I
 see he’s no g
ood and think I�
��ll go and fetc
h a likelier on
e.”  “You 
see?... What a w
ogue—it’s ju
"st as I thought,"
” said Deníso
v to the esaul.
 “Why didn’t
 you bwing that 
one?”  “Wh
at was the good 
of bringing him?
” Tíkhon inte
rrupted hastily 
and angrily—�
��that one would
n’t have done 
for you. As if I
 don’t know wh
at sort you wan
t!”  “What
 a bwute you are
!... Well?”  
 “I went for a
"nother one,” T"
íkhon continued
", “and I crept"
 like this thro
ugh the wood and
 lay down.” (H
e suddenly lay d
own on his stoma
ch with a suppl
e movement to sh
ow how he had do
ne it.) “One t
urned up and I 
"grabbed him, lik"
e this.” (He j
umped up quickly
 and lightly.) �
��‘Come along

’ I said. He s
"tarts yelling, a"

e were four of 
them. They rushe
d at me with the
ir little swords
. So I went for
 them with my ax
", this way: ‘W"
hat are you up t
o?’ says I. �
�Christ be with
 you!’” shou
"ted Tíkhon, wav"
ing his arms wit
h an angry scowl
 and throwing o
ut his chest.  
"
“Yes, we saw "
from the hill ho
w you took to yo
ur heels through
 the puddles!�
� said the esaul
", screwing up hi"
s glittering eye
s.  Pétya bad
ly wanted to lau
"gh, but noticed "
that they all re
frained from la
ughing. He turne
d his eyes rapid
ly from Tíkhon�
��s face to the 
esaul’s and D
"enísov’s, una"
ble to make out 
what it all mean
t.  “Don’t
 play the fool!�
�� said Denísov
", coughing angri"
ly. “Why didn�
��t you bwing t
he first one?”
  Tíkhon scra
tched his back w
ith one hand and
 his head with t
"he other,
then "
suddenly his who
le face expanded
" into a beaming,"
" foolish grin,
"
disclosing a gap
 where he had lo
st a tooth (that
 was why he was 
called Shcherb�
�ty—the gap-to
othed). Denísov
" smiled, and Pé"
tya burst into a
 peal of merry 
laughter in whic
h Tíkhon himsel
f joined.  “
"Oh, but he was a"
 regular good-fo
"r-nothing,” sa"
id Tíkhon. “T
he clothes on h
im—poor stuff!
 How could I bri

"ude, your honor!"
" Why,
he says: "
‘I’m a gener

  “You are a 
bwute!” said D
enísov. “I wa

 I questioned hi

on. “He said h
e didn’t know 
much. ‘There 
"are a lot of us,"
"’ he says, ‘"

he says. ‘Shou

"�� he says, ‘a"

� Tíkhon conclu
"ded, looking che"
erfully and reso
lutely into Den
ísov’s eyes. 
  “I’ll giv
e you a hundwed 
sharp lashes—t
hat’ll teach y
ou to play the 
fool!” said De
nísov severely.
  “But why a
re you angry?”
 remonstrated T�
"�khon, “just a"
s if I’d never
 seen your Fren
chmen! Only wait
 till it gets da
rk and I’ll fe
tch you any of 
them you want—
three if you lik
e.”  “Well
", let’s go,”"
" said Denísov, "
and rode all the
 way to the watc
hhouse in silen
ce and frowning 
angrily.  Tík
hon followed beh
ind and Pétya h
eard the Cossack
s laughing with 
"him
and at him,"
 about some pair
 of boots he had
 thrown into the
 bushes.  When
 the fit of laug
hter that had se
ized him at Tík
hon’s words an
d smile had pas
sed and Pétya r
ealized for a mo
ment that this T
íkhon had kille
"d a
man, he fel"
t uneasy. He loo
ked round at the
 captive drummer
 boy and felt a
 pang in his hea
rt. But this une
asiness lasted o
nly a moment. He
 felt it necess
ary to hold his 
"head higher, to "
"brace himself, a"
nd to question 
the esaul with a
n air of importa
nce about tomorr
ow’s undertaki
"ng, that
he mig"
ht not be unwort
hy of the compan
y in which he fo
und himself.  
The officer who 
had been sent to
 inquire met Den
ísov on the way
 with the news 
that Dólokhov w
as soon coming a
nd that all was 
well with him. 
 Denísov at on
ce cheered up an
"d, calling Péty"
"a to him, said: "
"“Well, tell
m"
e about yourself
.”      
CHAPTER VII  P
"étya, having le"
ft his people af
ter their depart
"ure from Moscow,"
 joined his reg
iment and was so
on taken as orde
rly by a general
 commanding a l
arge guerrilla d
etachment. From 
the time he rece
ived his commiss
"ion,
and especi"
ally since he ha
d joined the act
ive army and tak
en part in the 
battle of Vyázm
"a, Pétya had be"
en in a constant
 state of blissf
ul excitement a
t being grown-up
 and in a perpet
ual ecstatic hur
ry not to miss 
any chance to do
 something reall
y heroic. He was
 highly delighte
d with what he 
saw and experien
"ced in the army,"
 but at the same
 time it always
 seemed to him t
hat the really h
eroic exploits w
ere being perfo
rmed just where 
he did not happe
n to be. And he 
was always in a 
 hurry to get wh
ere he was not. 
  When on the t
wenty-first of O
ctober his gener
al expressed a w
ish to send som
ebody to Deníso
v’s detachment
", Pétya begged "
so piteously to 
be sent that th
e general could 
not refuse. But 
when dispatching
 him he recalled
 Pétya’s mad
 action at the b
attle of Vyázma
", where instead "
of riding by th
e road to the pl
ace to which he 
"had been sent, h"
e had galloped t
o the advanced 
line under the f
ire of the Frenc
h and had there 
twice fired his
 pistol. So now 
the general expl
icitly forbade h
is taking part i
n any action wh
atever of Denís
ov’s. That was
 why Pétya had 
blushed and grow
n confused when
 Denísov asked 
him whether he c
ould stay. Befor
e they had ridd
en to the outski
rts of the fores
t Pétya had con
sidered he must 
carry out his i
nstructions stri
ctly and return 
at once. But whe
n he saw the Fr
ench and saw Tí
khon and learned
 that there woul
d certainly be a
n attack that n
"ight, he decided"
", with the rapid"
ity with which y
oung people cha
"nge their views,"
 that the genera
"l, whom he had g"
reatly respected
" till
then, was"
 a rubbishy Germ
"an, that Deníso"
"v was a hero, th"
"e esaul a hero,"
 and Tíkhon a h
"ero too, and tha"
t it would be sh
ameful for him t
o leave them at
 a moment of dif
ficulty.  It w
as already growi
ng dusk when Den
"ísov, Pétya, a"
nd the esaul rod
e up to the wat
chhouse. In the 
twilight saddled
 horses could be
" seen, and
Coss"
acks and hussars
 who had rigged 
up rough shelter
s in the glade a
nd were kindlin
g glowing fires 
in a hollow of t
he forest where 
the French coul
d not see the sm
oke. In the pass
age of the small
 watchhouse a C
ossack with slee
ves rolled up wa
s chopping some 
mutton. In the r
oom three offic
ers of Denísov�
��s band were co
nverting a door 
into a tabletop.
 Pétya took of
f his wet clothe
"s, gave them to "
"be dried, and at"
 once began hel
ping the officer
s to fix up the 
dinner table.  
 In ten minutes 
the table was re
ady and a napkin
 spread on it. O
n the table wer
"e vodka, a flask"
" of rum, white b"
"read, roast mutt"
"on, and salt.
"
 Sitting at tabl
e with the offic
ers and tearing 
the fat savory m
utton with his 
"hands, down whic"
h the grease tri
"ckled, Pétya wa"
s in an ecstatic
 childish state
 of love for all
" men, and conseq"
uently of confid
ence that other
s loved him in t
he same way.  
“So then what 
"do you think, Va"
síli Dmítrich?
” said he to D
enísov. “It�
�s all right my
 staying a day w
ith you?” And 
not waiting for 
a reply he answ
ered his own que
stion: “You se
e I was told to 
"find out—well,"
 I am finding o
ut.... Only do l
et me into the v
ery... into the 
chief... I don�
��t want a rewar
d.... But I want
...”  Pétya
 clenched his te
eth and looked a
"round, throwing "
back his head an
d flourishing h
is arms.  “I
nto the vewy chi
ef...” Deníso
v repeated with 
a smile.  “O
"nly, please let "
me command somet
"hing, so that I "
may really comma
nd...” Pétya
 went on. “Wha
t would it be to
" you?... Oh, you"
 want a knife?�
"� he
said, turn"
ing to an office
r who wished to 
cut himself a pi
ece of mutton. 
 And he handed 
him his clasp kn
ife. The officer
 admired it.  
“Please keep i
t. I have severa
"l like it,” sa"
"id Pétya, blush"
ing. “Heavens
! I was quite fo
rgetting!” he 
suddenly cried. 
“I have some 
"raisins, fine on"
"es; you know, se"
edless ones. We 
have a new sutle
r and he has su
ch capital thing
s. I bought ten 
pounds. I am use
d to something 
sweet. Would you
 like some?...�
� and Pétya ran
 out into the pa
ssage to his Co
ssack and brough
t back some bags
 which contained
 about five poun
ds of raisins. 
"“Have some, ge"
"ntlemen, have so"
me!”  “You
 want a coffeepo
"t, don’t you?�"
�� he asked the 
esaul. “I boug
ht a capital on
e from our sutle
r! He has splend
id things. And h
e’s very hone
"st, that’s the"
 chief thing. I�
��ll be sure to 
send it to you. 
Or perhaps your
 flints are givi
"ng out, or are w"
orn out—that h
appens sometime
"s, you know. I h"
ave brought some

hey are”—and
 he showed a ba
g—“a hundred
 flints. I bough
t them very chea
p. Please take a
s many as you w
"ant, or all if y"
ou like....” 
"
Then suddenly,"
 dismayed lest h
e had said too m
"uch, Pétya stop"
ped and blushed
.  He tried to
 remember whethe
r he had not don
e anything else 
that was foolis
h. And running o
ver the events o
f the day he rem
embered the Fren
ch drummer boy.
 “It’s capit
"al for us here, "
but what of him?
 Where have they
 put him? Have 
they fed him? Ha
ven’t they hur
t his feelings?�
�� he thought. 
But having caugh
t himself saying
 too much about 
"the flints, he w"
as now afraid t
o speak out.  
"“I might ask,�"
"�� he thought, �"
��but they’ll 
say: ‘He’s a
 boy himself and
 so he pities t
he boy.’ I’l
l show them tomo
rrow whether I�
�m a boy. Will i
t seem odd if I
 ask?” Pétya 
thought. “Well
", never mind!”"
 and immediately
",
blushing and "
looking anxiousl
y at the officer
s to see if they
 appeared ironi
"cal, he said:
"
 “May I call i
n that boy who w
as taken prisone
r and give him s
omething to eat
?... Perhaps...�
"��

“Yes, he"
’s a poor litt
"le fellow,” sa"
"id Denísov, who"
 evidently saw 
nothing shameful
 in this reminde
r. “Call him i
n. His name is V
incent Bosse. H
ave him fetched.
”  “I’ll
" call him,” sa"
id Pétya.  �
"�Yes, yes, call "
him. A poor litt
"le fellow,” De"
nísov repeated.
  Pétya was s
tanding at the d
oor when Deníso
v said this. He 
slipped in betw
een the officers
", came close to "
"Denísov, and sa"
id:  “Let me
" kiss you, dear "
"old fellow! Oh, "
"how fine, how sp"
lendid!”  An
d having kissed 
Denísov he ran 
out of the hut. 
  “Bosse! Vin
cent!” Pétya 
"cried, stopping "
outside the door
.  “Who do y
"ou want, sir?”"
 asked a voice i
n the darkness. 
  Pétya replie
d that he wanted
 the French lad 
who had been cap
tured that day.
"

“Ah, Vesé"
nny?” said a C
ossack.  Vince
"nt, the boy’s "
"name, had alread"
y been changed b
y the Cossacks i
nto Vesénny (v
ernal) and into 
Vesénya by the 
peasants and sol
diers. In both 
these adaptation
s the reference 
to spring (vesn�
�) matched the i
mpression made 
by the young lad
.  “He is wa
rming himself th
ere by the bonfi
"re. Ho, Vesénya"
! Vesénya!—V

hing voices were
 heard calling t
o one another in
 the darkness. 
  “He’s a s

d an hussar stan

. “We gave him

He was awfully h

"

“Ah, c’es"

Pétya. “Voule

"e in, come in.�"
"�


“Merci,"
" monsieur,” * "
said the drummer
 boy in a trembl
ing almost child
"ish
voice, and "
he began scrapin
g his dirty feet
 on the threshol
d.      * “T
"hank you, sir.�"
�   There wer
e many things P�
�tya wanted to s
ay to the drumme
"r boy, but did
"
not dare to. He 
stood irresolute
ly beside him in
 the passage. Th
en in the darkn
ess he took the 
boy’s hand and
 pressed it.  
"“Come in, come"
 in!” he repea
ted in a gentle 
"whisper. “Oh, "
what can I do f
or him?” he th
"ought, and openi"
ng the door he l
et the boy pass 
in first.  Whe
n the boy had en
"tered the hut, P"
étya sat down a
t a distance fro
"m
him, consider"
ing it beneath h
is dignity to pa
y attention to h
im. But he fing
ered the money i
n his pocket and
 wondered whethe
r it would seem 
 ridiculous to g
ive some to the 
drummer boy.  
    CHAPTER 
VIII  The arri
val of Dólokhov
 diverted Pétya
’s attention f
rom the drummer 
"boy,
to whom De"
nísov had had s
ome mutton and v
"odka given, and "
whom he had had 
 dressed in a Ru
ssian coat so th
at he might be k
ept with their b
and and not sen
t away with the 
other prisoners.
 Pétya had hear
d in the army ma
ny stories of D
ólokhov’s ext
raordinary brave
ry and of his cr
uelty to the Fr
"ench, so from th"
e moment he ente
red the hut Pét
ya did not take 
his eyes from h
"im, but braced h"
imself up more a
nd more and held
" his head
high,"
 that he might n
ot be unworthy e
ven of such comp
any.  Dólokho
v’s appearance
 amazed Pétya b
y its simplicity
.  Denísov wo
re a Cossack coa
"t, had a beard, "
had an icon of N
icholas the Won
der-Worker on hi
"s breast, and hi"
s way of speakin
g and everything
 he did indicat
ed his unusual p
osition. But Dó
"lokhov, who in M"
oscow had worn 
a Persian costum
"e, had now the a"
ppearance of a m
ost correct offi
cer of the Guar
ds. He was clean
-shaven and wore
 a Guardsman’s
 padded coat wit
h an Order of S
t. George at his
 buttonhole and 
a plain forage c
ap set straight
 on his head. He
 took off his we
t felt cloak in 
a corner of the
" room, and witho"
ut greeting anyo
ne went up to De
nísov and began
 questioning hi
m about the matt
er in hand. Den�
�sov told him of
 the designs th
e large detachme
nts had on the t
"ransport, of the"
 message Pétya 
"
had brought, an"
d his own replie
s to both genera
ls. Then he told
 him all he kne
w of the French 
detachment.  �
��That’s so. B
ut we must know 
what troops they
 are and their n
"umbers,”
said"
 Dólokhov. “I
t will be necess
ary to go there.
 We can’t star
t the affair wi
thout knowing fo
r certain how ma
ny there are. I 
like to work ac
curately. Here n
ow—wouldn’t 
one of these gen
tlemen like to r
ide over to the
 French camp wit
h me? I have bro
ught a spare uni
form.”  “I
", I... I’ll go"
 with you!” cr
ied Pétya.  �
��There’s no n
eed for you to g
"o at all,” sai"
"d Denísov, addr"
essing Dólokho
"v, “and as for"
" him, I won’t "
let him go on an
y account.”  
 “I like that!
” exclaimed P�
�tya. “Why sho
uldn’t I go?�
�  “Because 
it’s useless.�
"��

“Well, y"
ou must excuse m
"e, because... be"
cause... I shall
" go, and that’"
s all. You’ll
" take me, won’"
t you?” he sai
"d, turning to D�"
�lokhov.  “W
hy not?” Dólo
khov answered ab
"sently, scrutini"
zing the face of
 the French dru
mmer boy. “Hav
e you had that y
oungster with yo
u long?” he a
sked Denísov. 
 “He was take
n today but he k
nows nothing. I�
��m keeping him 
with me.”  �
"��Yes, and where"
 do you put the 
others?” inqui
red Dólokhov. 
 “Where? I se
nd them away and
 take a weceipt 
"for them,” sho"
"uted Denísov,
"
suddenly flushin
g. “And I say 
boldly that I ha
ve not a single 
man’s life on
 my conscience. 
Would it be diff
icult for you to
 send thirty or 
 thwee hundwed m
en to town under
" escort, instead"
 of staining—I
 speak bluntly�
��staining the h
onor of a soldie
r?”  “That
 kind of amiable
 talk would be s
uitable from thi
s young count of
"
sixteen,” sa"
id Dólokhov wit
"h cold irony, �"
�but it’s time
 for you to drop
 it.”  “W
"hy, I’ve not s"
aid anything! I 
only say that I�
��ll certainly g
"o with
you,” "
said Pétya shyl
y.  “But for
" you and me, old"
" fellow, it’s "
time to drop the
"se amenities,”"
 continued Dól
"okhov, as if he "
found particular
 pleasure in spe
aking of this s
ubject which irr
itated Denísov.
" “Now, why hav"
e you kept this 
lad?” he went
" on, swaying his"
 head. “Becaus
e you are sorry 
for him! Don’t
 we know those 
‘receipts’ o
f yours? You sen
d a hundred men 
"away, and thirty"
 get there. The
 rest either sta
rve or get kille
d. So isn’t it
 all the same n
ot to send them?
”  The esaul
", screwing up hi"
s light-colored 
"eyes, nodded app"
rovingly.  “
That’s not the
 point. I’m no
t going to discu
ss the matter. I
 do not wish to
 take it on my c
onscience. You s
ay they’ll die
. All wight. Onl
y not by my fau
lt!”  Dólok
hov began laughi
ng.  “Who ha
s told them not 
to capture me th
ese twenty times
 over? But if t
hey did catch me
 they’d string
 me up to an asp
"en tree, and wit"
h all your chiv
alry just the sa
me.” He paused
". “However, we"
 must get to wor
k. Tell the Cos
sack to fetch my
 kit. I have two
 French uniforms
" in it.
Well, a"
re you coming wi
th me?” he ask
ed Pétya.  �
"�I? Yes, yes, ce"
rtainly!” crie
"d Pétya, blushi"
ng almost to tea
rs and glancing
 at Denísov.  
 While Dólokhov
 had been disput
ing with Deníso
v what should be
 done with pris
"oners, Pétya ha"
d once more felt
 awkward and res
tless; but again
 he had no time
 to grasp fully 
what they were t
alking about. �
"�If grown-up,
d"
istinguished men
" think so, it mu"
st be necessary 
"and right,” th"
ought he. “Bu
t above all Den�
�sov must not da
re to imagine th
at I’ll obey h
im and that he 
can order me abo
ut. I will certa
inly go to the F
rench camp with 
 Dólokhov. If h
"e can, so can I!"
”  And to al
l Denísov’s p
"ersuasions, Pét"
ya replied that 
he too was accu
stomed to do eve
rything accurate
ly and not just 
"anyhow, and that"
 he never consi
dered personal d
anger.  “For
 you’ll admit 
that if we don�
�t know for sure
 how many of the
m there are... 
hundreds of live
s may depend on 
"it, while there "
are only two of
" us. Besides, I "
want to go very 
much and certain
"ly will go, so d"
on’t hinder m
"e,” said he. �"
��It will only m
ake things worse
....”     
  CHAPTER IX  
 Having put on F
rench greatcoats
" and shakos, Pé"
tya and Dólokho
v rode to the c
learing from whi
ch Denísov had 
reconnoitered th
"e French camp,
"
and emerging fro
m the forest in 
pitch darkness t
hey descended in
to the hollow. 
On reaching the 
"bottom, Dólokho"
v told the Cossa
cks accompanying
 him to await h
im there and rod
e on at a quick 
trot along the r
oad to the brid
"ge. Pétya, his "
heart in his mou
th with exciteme
"nt, rode by his "
side.  “If w
"e’re caught, I"
 won’t be take
n alive! I have 
"a pistol,” whi"
spered he.  �
��Don’t talk R
"ussian,” said "
Dólokhov in a h
"urried whisper, "
and at that ver
y moment they he
ard through the 
darkness the cha
llenge: “Qui v
ive?” * and t
he click of a mu
sket.      * �
��Who goes there
?”   The bl
ood rushed to P�
�tya’s face an
d he grasped his
 pistol.  “L
"anciers du 6-me,"
” * replied D�
"�lokhov, neither"
 hastening nor s
lackening his h
orse’s pace. 
     * “Lance
rs of the 6th Re
giment.”   
The black figure
 of a sentinel s
tood on the brid
ge.  “Mot d�
��ordre.” *  
     * “Passwo
rd.”   Dól
okhov reined in 
his horse and ad
vanced at a walk
.  “Dites do
"nc, le colonel G"
érard est ici?�
�� * he asked. 
     * “Tell 
"me, is Colonel G"
érard here?” 
   “Mot d’
"ordre,” repeat"
"ed the sentinel,"
 barring the way
 and not replyin
g.  “Quand u
n officier fait 
"sa ronde, les se"
ntinelles ne dem
andent pas le m
ot d’ordre...�
�� cried Dólokh
ov suddenly flar
ing up and ridin
g straight at t
he sentinel. “
Je vous demande 
si le colonel es
t ici.” *   
    * “When an
 officer is maki
"ng his round, se"
ntinels don’t 
ask      him fo
r the password..
.. I am asking y
ou if the colone
l is      here.
”   And wit
hout waiting for
 an answer from 
"the sentinel, wh"
o had stepped a
"side, Dólokhov "
rode up the incl
ine at a walk. 
 Noticing the b
lack outline of 
a man crossing t
"he road, Dólokh"
ov stopped him 
and inquired whe
re the commander
 and officers we
"re. The man,
a "
soldier with a s
ack over his sho
"ulder, stopped, "
came close up to
 Dólokhov’s 
"horse, touched i"
"t with his hand,"
 and explained s
imply and in a 
friendly way tha
t the commander 
and the officers
 were higher up 
 the hill to the
 right in the co
urtyard of the f
"arm, as he calle"
d the landowner
’s house.  H
aving ridden up 
"the road, on bot"
h sides of which
 French talk cou
ld be heard aro
und the campfire
"s, Dólokhov tur"
ned into the cou
rtyard of the l
andowner’s hou
se. Having ridde
"n in, he dismoun"
ted and approach
ed a big blazin
"g campfire, arou"
nd which sat sev
eral men talking
 noisily. Somet
hing was boiling
 in a small caul
dron at the edge
 of the fire and
 a soldier in a
 peaked cap and 
"blue overcoat, l"
it up by the fir
"e, was
kneeling"
 beside it stirr
ing its contents
 with a ramrod. 
"

“Oh, he’s"
 a hard nut to c
"rack,” said on"
e of the officer
s who was sittin
g in the shadow
 at the other si
de of the fire. 
  “He’ll ma
ke them get a mo
"ve on, those fel"
lows!” said an
"other, laughing."
  Both fell si
"lent, peering ou"
t through the da
rkness at the so
und of Dólokho
v’s and Pétya
’s steps as th
ey advanced to t
he fire leading 
their horses. 
"
“Bonjour, me"
ssieurs!” * sa
id Dólokhov lou
dly and clearly.
      * “Goo
"d day, gentlemen"
.”   There 
was a stir among
 the officers in
 the shadow beyo
"nd the fire,
an"
"d one tall, long"
"-necked officer,"
 walking round t
"he fire, came up"
 to Dólokhov. 
  “Is that yo
"u, Clément?” "
he asked. “Whe
re the devil...?
"” But, noticin"
"g
his mistake, "
he broke off sho
"rt and, with a f"
"rown, greeted D�"
�lokhov as a st
"ranger, asking w"
hat he could do 
for him.  Dól
okhov said that 
he and his compa
nion were trying
 to overtake the
"ir
regiment, an"
d addressing the
 company in gene
ral asked whethe
r they knew any
thing of the 6th
 Regiment. None 
of them knew any
"thing, and Péty"
a thought the o
fficers were beg
inning to look a
t him and Dólok
hov with hostil
ity and suspicio
n. For some seco
nds all were sil
ent.  “If yo
u were counting 
on the evening s
"oup, you have co"
"me too late,” "
said a voice fr
om behind the fi
re with a repres
sed laugh.  D�
�lokhov replied 
that they were n
ot hungry and mu
st push on farth
er that night. 
  He handed the
 horses over to 
the soldier who 
was stirring the
 pot and squatt
ed down on his h
eels by the fire
 beside the offi
cer with the lon
g neck. That of
ficer did not ta
ke his eyes from
 Dólokhov and a
gain asked to w
hat regiment he 
belonged. Dólok
"hov, as if he ha"
d not heard the 
"
question, did n"
"ot reply, but li"
ghting a short F
rench pipe which
 he took from h
is pocket began 
asking the offic
er in how far th
e road before th
em was safe fro
m Cossacks.  �
��Those brigands
" are everywhere,"
” replied an o
fficer from behi
nd the fire.  
 Dólokhov remar
ked that the Cos
sacks were a dan
ger only to stra
gglers such as 
his companion an
"d himself, “bu"
t probably they 
would not dare t
o attack large 
detachments?” 
he added inquiri
ngly. No one rep
lied.  “Well
", now he’ll co"
"me away,” Pét"
ya thought every
 moment as he st
ood by the camp
fire listening t
o the talk.  B
ut Dólokhov res
tarted the conve
rsation which ha
d dropped and be
gan putting dir
ect questions as
 to how many men
 there were in t
"he battalion,
h"
ow many battalio
"ns, and how many"
 prisoners. Aski
ng about the Rus
sian prisoners 
with that detach
"ment, Dólokhov "
said:  “A ho
rrid business dr
agging these cor
pses about with 
one! It would be
 better to shoo
"t such rabble,�"
� and burst into
" loud laughter, "
so strange that
 Pétya thought 
the French would
 immediately det
ect their disgui
"se,
and involun"
tarily took a st
ep back from the
 campfire.  No
 one replied a w
ord to Dólokhov
"’s laughter, a"
nd a French offi
cer whom they c
ould not see (he
 lay wrapped in 
a greatcoat) ros
e and whispered 
 something to a 
companion. Dólo
khov got up and 
called to the so
ldier who was h
olding their hor
ses.  “Will 
they bring our h
orses or not?”
" thought Pétya,"
 instinctively 
drawing nearer t
o Dólokhov.  
The horses were 
brought.  “G
"ood evening, gen"
"tlemen,” said "
Dólokhov.  P�
�tya wished to s
ay “Good night
” but could no
t utter a word. 
The officers we
re whispering to
gether. Dólokho
v was a long tim
e mounting his 
horse which woul
d not stand stil
"l, then he rode "
out of the yard 
at a footpace. 
Pétya rode besi
"de him, longing "
to look round to
 see whether or 
 not the French 
were running aft
"er them, but not"
 daring to.  C
oming out onto t
he road Dólokho
v did not ride b
ack across the o
"pen
country, bu"
t through the vi
llage. At one sp
ot he stopped an
d listened. “
Do you hear?” 
he asked. Pétya
 recognized the 
sound of Russian
 voices and saw
 the dark figure
s of Russian pri
soners round the
ir campfires. W
hen they had des
cended to the br
idge Pétya and 
Dólokhov rode p
ast the sentine
"l, who without s"
aying a word pac
ed morosely up a
"nd down it, then"
 they descended
 into the hollow
 where the Cossa
cks awaited them
.  “Well now
", good-by. Tell "
"Denísov, ‘at "
the first shot a
"t daybreak,’�"
� said Dólokho
v and was about 
"to ride away, bu"
t Pétya seized 
hold of him.  
“Really!” he
" cried, “you a"
re such a hero! 
"Oh, how fine, ho"
w splendid! How
 I love you!” 
"

“All right,"
 all right!” s
aid Dólokhov. B
ut Pétya did no
t let go of him 
 and Dólokhov s
aw through the g
loom that Pétya
 was bending tow
ard him and wan
ted to kiss him.
 Dólokhov kisse
"d him, laughed, "
turned his horse
", and
vanished "
into the darknes
s.      CH
APTER X  Havin
g returned to th
e watchman’s h
"ut, Pétya found"
 Denísov in the
 passage. He wa
s awaiting Péty
a’s return in 
a state of agita
"tion,
anxiety, "
and self-reproac
h for having let
 him go.  “T
hank God!” he 
exclaimed. “Ye
"s, thank God!”"
" he repeated, li"
stening to Pét
ya’s rapturous
 account. “But
", devil take you"
", I haven’t sl"
ept because of 
"you! Well, thank"
 God. Now lie do
wn. We can still
 get a nap befor
e morning.” 
"
“But... no,�"
"�� said Pétya, "
“I don’t wan
t to sleep yet. 
Besides I know 
"myself, if I fal"
l asleep it’s 
finished. And th
en I am used to 
not sleeping be
fore a battle.�
�  He sat awhi
le in the hut jo
yfully recalling
 the details of 
his expedition 
and vividly pict
uring to himself
 what would happ
en next day.  
"Then, noticing t"
hat Denísov was
" asleep, he rose"
 and went out of
 doors.  It wa
s still quite da
rk outside. The 
"rain was over, b"
ut drops were st
ill falling fro
m the trees. Nea
r the watchman�
�s hut the black
 shapes of the 
Cossacks’ shan
ties and of hors
es tethered toge
ther could be se
en. Behind the 
hut the dark sha
pes of the two w
agons with their
 horses beside t
hem were discer
"nible, and in th"
e hollow the dyi
ng campfire glea
med red. Not al
l the Cossacks a
nd hussars were 
asleep; here and
" there, amid the"
 sounds of fall
ing drops and th
e munching of th
e horses near by
", could be
hear"
d low voices whi
ch seemed to be 
whispering.  P
"étya came out, "
peered into the 
"darkness, and we"
nt up to the wag
ons. Someone wa
s snoring under 
"them, and around"
 them stood sadd
led horses munc
hing their oats.
 In the dark Pé
tya recognized h
"is own horse, wh"
ich he called �
��Karabákh” t
hough it was of 
"Ukranian breed, "
and went up to i
"t.

“Well, K"
arabákh! We’l
l do some servic
"e tomorrow,” s"
"aid he, sniffing"
 its nostrils a
nd kissing it. 
 “Why aren’
"t you asleep, si"
r?” said a Cos
sack who was sit

"gon.

“No, a"
h... Likhachëv�
��isn’t that y
our name? Do you
 know I have onl
y just come bac
k! We’ve been 
into the French 
camp.”  And 
Pétya gave the 
Cossack a detail
ed account not o
nly of his ride 
but also of his
" object, and why"
 he considered i
t better to risk
 his life than 
to act “just a
nyhow.”  “
"Well, you should"
 get some sleep 
"now,” said the"
 Cossack.  “
"No, I am used to"
" this,” said P"
"étya. “I say,"
 aren’t the fl
ints in your pi
stols worn out? 
I brought some w
ith me. Don’t 
you want any? Yo
u can have some
.”  The Coss
ack bent forward
 from under the 
wagon to get a c
loser look at P
étya.  “Bec
ause I am accust

tya. “Some fe

e Cossack.  �
"�Oh yes, another"

"my dear fellow, "
will you sharpen
 my saber for m

...” (Pétya f
eared to tell a 
"lie, and the sab"
er never had be

��Can you do it?
”  “Of cou
rse I can.”  
 Likhachëv got 
"up, rummaged in "
"his pack, and so"
on Pétya heard 
the warlike sou
nd of steel on w
hetstone. He cli
mbed onto the wa
gon and sat on i
ts edge. The Co
ssack was sharpe
ning the saber u
nder the wagon. 
  “I say! Are
 the lads asleep
?” asked Péty
a.  “Some ar

"��

“Well, a"

  “Vesénny? 
"Oh, he’s throw"

r that Pétya re
mained silent fo

"
“There, by th"

he hussar took t

red blotch below

rs of a campfire
", that the man w"
ho had come for
 the cup was an 
hussar who wante
d a drink; but h
e neither knew n
or waited to kn

r it might be a 
cavern leading t
o the very depth

 Perhaps the red
 spot was a fire

. Perhaps he was

"on a wagon, but "
it might very w
ell be that he w
as not sitting o

 a terribly high
 tower from whi
"ch, if he fell, "
he would have to
 fall for a whol
e day or a whol
"e month, or go o"

ver reach the bo

 was just the C
"ossack, Likhach�"
"�v, who was sitt"
ing under the wa
"gon, but it
mig"
ht be the kindes
"t, bravest, most"
" wonderful, most"
 splendid man in
" the
world, who"
m no one knew of
. It might reall
y have been that
 the hussar cam
e for water and 
went back into t
"he hollow, but p"
erhaps he had si
mply vanished�
�disappeared alt
ogether and diss
olved into nothi
ngness.  Nothi
ng Pétya could 
have seen now wo
uld have surpris
ed him. He was i
n a fairy kingd
om where everyth
ing was possible
.  He looked u
p at the sky. An
d the sky was a 
fairy realm like
 the earth. It 
"was clearing, an"
d over the tops 
of the trees clo
uds were swiftly
 sailing as if 
unveiling the st
ars. Sometimes i
t looked as if t
he clouds were 
"passing, and a c"
lear black sky a
ppeared. Sometim
es it seemed as 
 if the black sp
aces were clouds
. Sometimes the 
sky seemed to be
" rising
high, h"
"igh overhead, an"
d then it seemed
 to sink so low 
that one could 
touch it with on
e’s hand.  P
étya’s eyes b
egan to close an
d he swayed a li
ttle.  The tre
es were dripping
. Quiet talking 
was heard. The h
orses neighed an
d jostled one a
nother. Someone 
snored.  “Oz
"heg-zheg, Ozheg-"
zheg...” hisse
d the saber agai
nst the whetston
"e,
and suddenly"
 Pétya heard an
 harmonious orch
estra playing so
"me unknown,
swe"
etly solemn hymn
. Pétya was as 
musical as Natá
sha and more so 
"than
Nicholas, "
but had never le
arned music or t
"hought about it,"
 and so the mel
ody that unexpec
tedly came to hi
s mind seemed to
 him particularl
y fresh and att
ractive. The mus
ic became more a
nd more audible.
 The melody gre
w and passed fro
m one instrument
 to another. And
 what was played
 was a fugue—
though Pétya ha
d not the least 
conception of wh
at a fugue is. 
Each instrument�
��now resembling
 a violin and no
"w a horn, but be"
tter and cleare
r than violin or
 horn—played i
"ts own part, and"
 before it had 
finished the mel
ody merged with 
another instrume
nt that began al
most the same a
"ir, and then wit"
h a third and a 
fourth; and they
 all blended int
o one and again
 became separate
 and again blend
"ed, now into sol"
emn church musi
"c, now into some"
thing dazzlingly
 brilliant and t
riumphant.  �
"�Oh—why, that "
was in a dream!�
�� Pétya said t
"o himself, as he"
 lurched forwar
d. “It’s in 
my ears. But per
haps it’s musi
c of my own. Wel
"l, go
on, my mu"
sic! Now!...” 
  He closed his
" eyes, and, from"
 all sides as if
 from a distance
", sounds
flutte"
"red, grew into h"
"armonies, separa"
"ted, blended, an"
d again all min
gled into the sa
me sweet and sol
"emn hymn. “Oh,"
 this is delight
ful! As much as
 I like and as I
 like!” said P
étya to himself
. He tried to c
onduct that enor
mous orchestra. 
  “Now softly
", softly die awa"
y!” and the so
unds obeyed him.
" “Now fuller,"
 more joyful. St
ill more and mor
e joyful!” And
 from an unknown
 depth rose inc
reasingly triump
hant sounds. “
Now voices join 
in!” ordered P
étya. And at f
irst from afar h
e heard men’s 
voices and then 
women’s. The v
oices grew in h
armonious triump
"hant strength, a"
nd Pétya listen
ed to their sur
passing beauty i
n awe and joy. 
 With a solemn 
triumphal march 
there mingled a 
"song, the drip f"
"rom the
trees, "
and the hissing 
"of the saber, �"
�Ozheg-zheg-zheg
...” and again
 the horses jos
tled one another
" and neighed, no"
t disturbing the
 choir but join
ing in it.  P�
�tya did not kno
w how long this 
lasted: he enjoy
ed himself all t
"he
time, wonder"
ed at his enjoym
ent and regrette
d that there was
 no one to shar
e it. He was awa
kened by Likhach
ëv’s kindly v
oice.  “It�
"�s ready, your h"
onor; you can sp
lit a Frenchman 
in half with it!
”  Pétya wo
ke up.  “It�
��s getting ligh
"t, it’s really"
 getting light!�
�� he exclaimed.
  The horses t
hat had previous
ly been invisibl
e could now be s
een to their ve
"ry tails, and a "
watery light sho
wed itself throu
gh the bare bran
ches. Pétya sh
"ook himself, jum"
"ped up, took a r"
uble from his po
cket and gave it
 to Likhachëv;
 then he flouris
"hed the saber, t"
"ested it, and sh"
eathed it. The 
Cossacks were un
tying their hors
es and tightenin
g their saddle 
girths.  “An
d here’s the c
"ommander,” sai"
d Likhachëv.  
 Denísov came o
ut of the watchm
"an’s hut and, "
having called P�
"�tya, gave
orde"
rs to get ready.
      CHAP
TER XI  The me
n rapidly picked
 out their horse
s in the semidar
"kness, tightened"
 their saddle g
"irths, and forme"
d companies. Den
ísov stood by t
he watchman’s
 hut giving fina
l orders. The in
fantry of the de
tachment passed
 along the road 
and quickly disa
ppeared amid the
 trees in the mi
st of early daw
"n, hundreds of f"
eet splashing th
rough the mud. T
he esaul gave s
ome orders to hi
s men. Pétya he
ld his horse by 
"the bridle,
imp"
atiently awaitin
g the order to m
"ount. His face, "
having been bath
ed in cold wate
"r, was all aglow"
", and his eyes w"
ere particularly
 brilliant. Col
d shivers ran do
wn his spine and
 his whole body 
pulsed rhythmica
"lly.

“Well,"
 is ev’wything
 weady?” asked
 Denísov. “Bw
ing the horses.�
��  The horses
 were brought. D
enísov was angr
y with the Cossa
ck because the 
saddle girths we
"re too slack, re"
"proved him, and "
mounted. Pétya 
put his foot in
 the stirrup. Hi
s horse by habit
 made as if to n
"ip his leg, but"
 Pétya leaped q
uickly into the 
saddle unconscio
us of his own we
"ight and,
turni"
ng to look at th
e hussars starti
ng in the darkne
"ss behind him, r"
ode up to Dení
sov.  “Vasí
"li Dmítrich, en"
trust me with so
me commission! P
lease... for God
’s sake...!�
� said he.  De
nísov seemed to
 have forgotten 
Pétya’s very 
existence. He tu
rned to glance 
at him.  “I 
ask one thing of
" you,” he said"
" sternly, “to "
obey me and not 
shove yourself 
forward anywhere
.”  He did n
ot say another w
ord to Pétya bu
t rode in silenc
e all the way. 
When they had co
me to the edge o
f the forest it 
was noticeably g
rowing light ov
er the field. De
nísov talked in
 whispers with t
he esaul and th
e Cossacks rode 
past Pétya and 
Denísov. When t
hey had all ridd
"en by,
Denísov"
 touched his hor
se and rode down
 the hill. Slipp
ing onto their 
haunches and sli
"ding, the horses"
 descended with 
their riders int
o the ravine. P
étya rode besid
"e Denísov, the "
pulsation of his
 body constantly
 increasing. It
 was getting lig
hter and lighter
", but the mist s"
till hid distan
t objects. Havin
g reached the va
"lley, Denísov l"
ooked back and 
nodded to a Coss
ack beside him. 
  “The signal
!” said he.  
 The Cossack rai
sed his arm and 
a shot rang out.
 In an instant t
he tramp of hor
ses galloping fo
"rward was heard,"
 shouts came fro
"m various sides,"
 and then more 
shots.  At the
 first sound of 
trampling hoofs 
"and shouting, P�"
�tya lashed his 
 horse and loose
ning his rein ga
"lloped forward, "
not heeding Den�
�sov who shoute
d at him. It see
med to Pétya th
at at the moment
 the shot was f
ired it suddenly
 became as brigh
t as noon. He ga
lloped to the br
idge. Cossacks 
were galloping a
long the road in
 front of him. O
n the bridge he
 collided with a
 Cossack who had
" fallen behind, "
but he galloped 
on. In front of
" him soldiers, p"
robably Frenchme
"n, were running "
from right to l
eft across the r
oad. One of them
 fell in the mud
 under his horse
’s feet.  C
ossacks were cro
wding about a hu
"t, busy with som"
ething. From the
 midst of that 
crowd terrible s
creams arose. P�
�tya galloped up
", and the
first"
 thing he saw wa
s the pale face 
and trembling ja
w of a Frenchman
",
clutching the"
 handle of a lan
ce that had been
 aimed at him. 
 “Hurrah!... 
Lads!... ours!�
� shouted Pétya
", and giving rei"
n to his excite
d horse he gallo
ped forward alon
g the village st
reet.  He coul
d hear shooting 
ahead of him. Co
"ssacks, hussars,"
 and ragged Rus
"sian prisoners, "
who had come run
ning from both s
ides of the road
",
were shouting"
 something loudl
y and incoherent
ly. A gallant-lo
oking Frenchman
", in a blue over"
"coat, capless, a"
nd with a frowni
"ng red face,
ha"
d been defending
 himself against
 the hussars. Wh
en Pétya gallop
ed up the Frenc
hman had already
 fallen. “Too 
late again!” f
lashed through 
Pétya’s mind 
and he galloped 
on to the place 
from which the r
apid firing cou
ld be heard. The
 shots came from
 the yard of the
 landowner’s h
ouse he had vis
ited the night b
efore with Dólo
khov. The French
 were making a 
stand there behi
nd a wattle fenc
e in a garden th
ickly overgrown 
with bushes and
 were firing at 
the Cossacks who
 crowded at the 
gateway. Throug
"h the smoke, as "
he approached th
"e gate, Pétya s"
"aw Dólokhov, wh"
ose face was of
 a pale-greenish
" tint, shouting "
to his men. “G
o round! Wait f
or the infantry!
” he exclaimed
 as Pétya rode 
up to him.  �
�Wait?... Hurrah
-ah-ah!” shout
"ed Pétya, and w"
ithout pausing a
 moment gallope
d to the place w
hence came the s
ounds of firing 
and where the s
moke was thickes
t.  A volley w
"as heard, and so"
me bullets whist
"led past, while "
others plashed 
against somethin
g. The Cossacks 
and Dólokhov ga
lloped after Pé
tya into the ga
teway of the cou
rtyard. In the d
ense wavering sm
oke some of the 
 French threw do
wn their arms an
d ran out of the
 bushes to meet 
"the
Cossacks, w"
hile others ran 
down the hill to
ward the pond. P
étya was gallo
ping along the c
"ourtyard, but in"
stead of holding
 the reins he wa
ved both his ar
ms about rapidly
" and strangely, "
slipping farther
 and farther to
 one side in his
 saddle. His hor
"se, having gallo"
ped up to a camp
fire that was s
moldering in the
" morning light, "
stopped suddenly
", and Pétya
fe"
ll heavily on to
 the wet ground.
 The Cossacks sa
w that his arms 
and legs jerked
 rapidly though 
his head was qui
te motionless. A
 bullet had pie
rced his skull. 
  After speakin
g to the senior 
"French officer, "
who came out of 
the house with 
a white handkerc
hief tied to his
 sword and annou
nced that they 
"surrendered, Dó"
lokhov dismounte
d and went up to
" Pétya, who lay"
 motionless wit
h outstretched a
rms.  “Done 
for!” he said 
"with a frown, an"
d went to the ga
te to meet Dení
sov who was rid
ing toward him. 
  “Killed?”
" cried Denísov,"
 recognizing fro
m a distance the
 unmistakably l
ifeless attitude
—very familiar
 to him—in whi
ch Pétya’s bo
dy was lying.  
 “Done for!”
 repeated Dólok
hov as if the ut
terance of these
 words afforded
" him pleasure, a"
nd he went quick
ly up to the pri
"soners, who
wer"
e surrounded by 
Cossacks who had
 hurried up. “
We won’t take 
them!” he cal
led out to Dení
sov.  Denísov
 did not reply; 
he rode up to P�
"�tya, dismounted"
", and with
trem"
bling hands turn
ed toward himsel
f the bloodstain
"ed, mud-bespatte"
red face which 
had already gone
 white.  “I 
am used to somet
hing sweet. Rais
"ins, fine ones.."
. take them all!
” he recalled
 Pétya’s word
s. And the Cossa
cks looked round
 in surprise at 
"the
sound, like"
 the yelp of a d
"og, with which D"
enísov turned a
"way, walked to
"
the wattle fence
", and seized hol"
d of it.  Amon
g the Russian pr
isoners rescued 
by Denísov and 
Dólokhov was Pi
erre Bezúkhov.
      CHAP
TER XII  Durin
g the whole of t
heir march from 
Moscow no fresh 
orders had been 
 issued by the F
rench authoritie
s concerning the
 party of prison
ers among whom 
was Pierre. On t
he twenty-second
 of October that
 party was no l
onger with the s
ame troops and b
aggage trains wi
th which it had 
left Moscow. Ha
lf the wagons la
den with hardtac
k that had trave
led the first s
tages with them 
had been capture
"d by Cossacks, t"
he other half ha
d gone on ahead
. Not one of tho
se dismounted ca
valrymen who had
 marched in fro
nt of the prison
ers was left; th
ey had all disap
peared. The arti
llery the priso
ners had seen in
 front of them d
uring the first 
days was now re
placed by Marsha
l Junot’s enor
mous baggage tra
"in, convoyed by"
 Westphalians. B
ehind the prison
ers came a caval
ry baggage train
.  From Vyázm
a onwards the Fr
"ench army, which"
 had till then m
oved in three c
"olumns, went on "
as a single grou
p. The symptoms 
of disorder that
 Pierre had not
iced at their fi
rst halting plac
e after leaving 
Moscow had now 
reached the utmo
st limit.  The
 road along whic
h they moved was
 bordered on bot
h sides by dead 
 horses; ragged 
men who had fall
en behind from v
arious regiments
 continually ch
"anged about, now"
 joining the mov
"ing column, now "
again lagging b
ehind it.  Sev
eral times durin
g the march fals
e alarms had bee
n given and the 
 soldiers of the
 escort had rais
ed their muskets
", fired, and run"
"
headlong, crus"
hing one another
", but had afterw"
ards reassembled
 and abused eac
h other for thei
r causeless pani
c.  These thre
e groups traveli
ng together—th
e cavalry stores
", the convoy of"
"
prisoners, and "
Junot’s baggag
e train—still 
constituted a se
parate and unit
"ed whole, though"
 each of the gro
ups was rapidly 
melting away.  
 Of the artiller
y baggage train 
which had consis
ted of a hundred
 and twenty wag
"ons, not more th"
an sixty now rem
ained; the rest 
had been captur
ed or left behin
d. Some of Junot
’s wagons also
 had been captur
ed or abandoned
. Three wagons h
ad been raided a
nd robbed by str
agglers from Da
vout’s corps. 
From the talk of
 the Germans Pie
rre learned that
 a larger guard
 had been allott
ed to that bagga
ge train than to
" the
prisoners,"
 and that one of
" their comrades,"
 a German soldie
"r, had been
sho"
t by the marshal
’s own order b
ecause a silver 
spoon belonging 
to the marshal 
had been found i
n his possession
.  The group o
f prisoners had 
melted away most
 of all. Of the 
three hundred a
nd thirty men wh
o had set out fr
om Moscow fewer 
than a hundred n
ow remained. Th
e prisoners were
 more burdensome
 to the escort t
han even the ca
valry saddles or
 Junot’s bagga
ge. They underst
ood that the sad
dles and Junot�
��s spoon might 
"be of some use, "
but that cold an
d hungry soldier
s should have t
o stand and guar
d equally cold a
nd hungry Russia
ns who froze an
d lagged behind 
on the road (in 
which case the o
rder was to sho
ot them) was not
 merely incompre
hensible but rev
olting. And the 
"
escort, as if a"
"fraid, in the gr"
ievous condition
 they themselves
" were in,
of gi"
ving way to the 
pity they felt f
or the prisoners
 and so renderin
g their own pli
"ght still worse,"
 treated them wi
th particular mo
roseness and se
verity.  At Do
rogobúzh while 
the soldiers of 
"the convoy, afte"
r locking the p
risoners in a st
"able, had gone o"
ff to pillage th
"eir own stores, "
several of the 
soldier prisoner
s tunneled under
 the wall and ra
"n away, but were"
 recaptured by 
the French and s
hot.  The arra
ngement adopted 
when they starte
"d, that the offi"
cer prisoners s
hould be kept se
parate from the 
"rest, had long s"
ince been abando
ned. All who co
uld walk went to
"gether, and afte"
r the third stag
e Pierre had re
joined Karatáev
 and the gray-bl
ue bandy-legged 
dog that had cho
sen Karatáev f
or its master. 
 On the third d
ay after leaving
 Moscow Karatáe
v again fell ill
 with the fever
 he had suffered
 from in the hos
"pital in Moscow,"
 and as he grew 
 gradually weake
r Pierre kept aw
ay from him. Pie
rre did not know
" why, but
since"
 Karatáev had b
egun to grow wea
ker it had cost 
him an effort to
 go near him. W
hen he did so an
d heard the subd
ued moaning with
 which Karatáe
v generally lay 
down at the halt
"ing places, and "
when he smelled 
 the odor emanat
ing from him whi
ch was now stron
"ger than before,"
 Pierre moved f
arther away and 
did not think ab
out him.  Whil
e imprisoned in 
the shed Pierre 
had learned not 
with his intelle
ct but with his
" whole being, by"
" life itself, th"
at man is create
d for happiness
", that happiness"
" is within him, "
in the satisfact
ion of simple h
"uman needs, and "
that all unhappi
ness arises not 
from privation b
ut from superfl
uity. And now du
ring these last 
three weeks of t
he march he had 
 learned still a
"nother new, cons"
olatory truth—
that nothing in 
this world is t
errible. He had 
learned that as 
there is no cond
ition in which m
an can be happy
 and entirely fr
"ee, so there is "
no condition in 
which he need b
e unhappy and la
ck freedom. He l
earned that suff
ering and freedo
m have their li
mits and that th
ose limits are v
ery near togethe
r; that the per
son in a bed of 
roses with one c
rumpled petal su
ffered as keenly
" as
he now, sle"
eping on the bar
e damp earth wit
h one side growi
ng chilled whil
e the other was 
warming; and tha
t when he had pu
t on tight danci
ng shoes he had
 suffered just a
s he did now whe
n he walked with
 bare feet that
 were covered wi
th sores—his f
ootgear having l
ong since fallen
 to pieces. He 
discovered that 
when he had marr
ied his wife—o
f his own free 
will as it had s
eemed to him—h
e had been no mo
re free than now
 when they lock
ed him up at nig
ht in a stable. 
Of all that he h
imself subsequen
tly termed his 
"sufferings, but "
which at the tim
e he scarcely fe
"lt, the worst
w"
as the state of 
"his bare, raw, a"
nd scab-covered 
feet. (The horse
flesh was appet
izing and nouris
"hing, the saltpe"
ter flavor of th
e gunpowder the
y used instead o
f salt was even 
pleasant; there 
was no great col
"d,
it was alway"
s warm walking i
"n the daytime, a"
nd at night ther
e were the camp
fires; the lice 
that devoured hi
m warmed his bod
y.) The one thin
g that was at f
irst hard to bea
r was his feet. 
  After the sec
ond day’s marc
"h Pierre, having"
 examined his fe
et by the campf
"ire, thought it "
would be impossi
ble to walk on t
hem; but when e
verybody got up 
"he went along, l"
"imping, and, whe"
n he had warmed 
"up,
walked with"
out feeling the 
"pain, though at "
night his feet w
ere more terrib
le to look at th
an before. Howev
"er, he did not l"
"ook at them now,"
 but thought of
 other things. 
 Only now did P
ierre realize th
e full strength 
of life in man a
nd the saving p
ower he has of t
ransferring his 
attention from o
ne thing to ano
"ther, which is l"
ike the safety v
alve of a boiler
 that allows su
perfluous steam 
to blow off when
 the pressure ex
ceeds a certain 
limit.  He did
 not see and did
 not hear how th
ey shot the pris
oners who lagged
"
behind, though"
 more than a hun
dred perished in
 that way. He di
d not think of 
Karatáev who gr
ew weaker every 
day and evidentl
y would soon ha
ve to share that
 fate. Still les
s did Pierre thi
nk about himself
. The harder hi
s position becam
e and the more t
errible the futu
"re, the more
in"
dependent of tha
t position in wh
ich he found him
self were the jo
yful and comfor
"ting thoughts, m"
"emories, and ima"
ginings that cam
e to him.    
   CHAPTER XII
I  At midday o
n the twenty-sec
ond of October P
ierre was going 
uphill along th
"e muddy, slipper"
"y road, looking "
at his feet and 
at the roughness
 of the way. Oc
casionally he gl
anced at the fam
iliar crowd arou
nd him and then
 again at his fe
et. The former a
nd the latter we
re alike familia
r and his own. 
The blue-gray ba
ndy legged dog r
an merrily along
 the side of th
"e road, sometime"
s in proof of it
s agility and se
lf-satisfaction 
 lifting one hin
d leg and hoppin
g along on three
", and then again"
 going on all f
our and rushing 
to bark at the c
rows that sat on
 the carrion. Th
e dog was merri
er and sleeker t
han it had been 
in Moscow. All a
round lay the f
lesh of differen
t animals—from
 men to horses�
�in various stag
es of decomposi
tion; and as the
 wolves were kep
t off by the pas
sing men the do
g could eat all 
it wanted.  It
 had been rainin
g since morning 
and had seemed a
s if at any mome
nt it might cea
se and the sky c
"lear, but after "
a short break it
 began raining 
harder than befo
re. The saturate
d road no longer
 absorbed the wa
"ter,
which ran "
along the ruts i
n streams.  Pi
erre walked alon
"g, looking from "
"side to side, co"
unting his steps
" in
threes, and"
 reckoning them 
off on his finge
rs. Mentally add
ressing the rai
"n, he repeated: "
"“Now then, now"
" then, go on! Pe"
lt harder!”  
 It seemed to hi
m that he was th
inking of nothin
"g, but far down "
and deep within
 him his soul wa
s occupied with 
something import
ant and comfort
ing. This someth
ing was a most s
ubtle spiritual 
deduction from a
 conversation w
ith Karatáev th
e day before.  
 At their yester
day’s halting 
"place, feeling c"
hilly by a dying
" campfire,
Pier"
re had got up an
d gone to the ne
"xt one, which wa"
s burning better
. There Platón
 Karatáev was s
itting covered u
p—head and all
—with his gre
atcoat as if it 
"were a vestment,"
 telling the sol
diers in his ef
fective and plea
sant though now 
feeble voice a s
tory Pierre knew
. It was alread
"y past midnight,"
 the hour when K
aratáev was usu
ally free of hi
s fever and part
icularly lively.
 When Pierre rea
ched the fire an
d heard Platón
’s voice enfee
"bled by illness,"
 and saw his pat
hetic face brig
htly lit up by t
"he blaze, he fel"
t a painful pric
k at his heart. 
His feeling of 
pity for this ma
n frightened him
 and he wished t
"o go away,
but "
there was no oth
"er fire, and Pie"
"rre sat down, tr"
ying not to look
 at Platón.  
"
“Well, how ar"
e you?” he ask
ed.  “How am
 I? If we grumbl
"e at sickness, G"
od won’t grant
" us death,” re"
"plied
Platón, "
and at once resu
med the story he
 had begun.  �
"��And so, brothe"
"r,” he continu"
"ed, with a smile"
 on his pale ema
ciated face and
 a particularly 
happy light in h
"is eyes, “you "
"see, brother...�"
��  Pierre had
 long been famil
iar with that st
ory. Karatáev h
ad told it to h
im alone some ha
lf-dozen times a
nd always with a
 specially joyfu
l emotion. But 
well as he knew 
"it, Pierre now l"
istened to that 
tale as to some
"thing new, and t"
he quiet rapture
 Karatáev evide
ntly felt as he 
told it communi
cated itself als
o to Pierre. The
 story was of an
 old merchant w
ho lived a good 
and God-fearing 
life with his fa
"mily, and who we"
nt once to the 
Nízhni fair wit
h a companion—
a rich merchant.
  Having put u
p at an inn they
 both went to sl
"eep, and next mo"
rning his compa
nion was found r
obbed and with h
is throat cut. A
 bloodstained kn
ife was found u
nder the old mer
chant’s pillow
". He was tried, "
"knouted, and
hi"
s nostrils havin
"g been torn off,"
 “all in due f
orm” as Karat�
"�ev put it,
he "
was sent to hard
 labor in Siberi
"a.

“And so,"
 brother” (it 
was at this poin
t that Pierre ca
"me up), “ten y"
ears or more pa
ssed by. The old
 man was living 
"as a convict, su"
bmitting as he 
should and doing
 no wrong. Only 
he prayed to God
 for death. Well
", one
night the"
 convicts were g
athered just as 
"we are, with the"
 old man among 
them. And they b
egan telling wha
t each was suffe
"ring for, and ho"
w they had sinn
ed against God. 
One told how he 
had taken a life
", another had
t"
"aken two, a thir"
d had set a hous
"e on fire, while"
 another had sim
ply been a vagr
ant and had done
 nothing. So the
y asked the old 
man: ‘What ar
e you being puni
"shed for, Daddy?"
"’—‘I, my d"
"ear brothers,’"
" said he, ‘am"
 being punished 
for my own and o
ther men’s sin
s. But I have no
t killed anyone
 or taken anythi
ng that was not 
"mine, but have o"
nly helped my p
oorer brothers. 
I was a merchant
", my dear brothe"
"rs, and had much"
 property. ‘A
nd he went on to
 tell them all a
bout it in due o
rder. ‘I don�
��t grieve for m
"yself,’ he say"
"s, ‘God, it se"
"ems, has chasten"
ed me. Only I a
m sorry for my o
ld wife and the 
"children,’ and"
 the old man beg
an to weep. Now
 it happened tha
t in the group w
as the very man 
who had killed 
the other mercha
nt. ‘Where did
" it happen, Dadd"
y?’ he said. �
"��When,
and in "
what month?’ H
e asked all abou
t it and his hea
rt began to ache
. So he comes u
p to the old man
" like this, and "
falls down at hi
s feet! ‘You 
are perishing be
"cause of me, Dad"
"dy,’ he says. "
‘It’s quite 
"true,
lads, tha"
"t this man,’ h"
"e says, ‘is be"
ing tortured inn
ocently and for 
"
nothing! I,’ "
"he says, ‘did "
"that deed, and I"
 put the knife u
nder your head 
while you were a
sleep. Forgive m
"e, Daddy,’ he "
"says, ‘for Chr"
ist’s sake!�
�”  Karatáe
"v paused, smilin"
g joyously as he
 gazed into the 
"fire, and he dre"
w the logs toge
ther.  “And 
the old man said
", ‘God will fo"
"rgive you, we ar"
e all sinners in
 His sight. I s
uffer for my own
" sins,’ and he"
 wept bitter tea
"rs. Well,
and w"
hat do you think
", dear friends?�"
�� Karatáev con
"tinued, his face"
 brightening mo
re and more with
 a rapturous smi
le as if what he
 now had to tel
l contained the 
chief charm and 
the whole meanin
g of his story: 
 “What do you 
"think, dear fell"
ows? That murder
er confessed to 
the authorities
. ‘I have take
"n six lives,’ "
he says (he was 
"a great sinner),"
 ‘but what I 
am most sorry fo
r is this old ma
n. Don’t let h
im suffer becau
se of me.’ So 
he confessed and
 it was all writ
ten down and the
 papers sent of
f in due form. T
he place was a l
"ong way off, and"
 while they wer
"e judging, what "
with one thing a
"nd another, fill"
ing in the pape
rs all in due fo
rm—the authori
ties I mean—ti
me passed. The a
ffair reached t
he Tsar. After a
 while the Tsar�
��s decree came:
 to set the mer
chant free and g
ive him a compen
sation that had 
been awarded. Th
e paper arrived
 and they began 
to look for the 
old man. ‘Wher
e is the old ma
n who has been s
uffering innocen
tly and in vain?
 A paper has com
e from the Tsar
!’ so they beg
an looking for h
"im,” here Kara"
táev’s lower 
"jaw
trembled, �"
��but God had al
ready forgiven h
im—he was dead
! That’s how i
"t
was, dear fel"
lows!” Karatá
ev concluded and
 sat for a long 
"time silent,
ga"
zing before him 
with a smile.  
 And Pierre’s 
soul was dimly b
ut joyfully fill
ed not by the st
ory itself but 
by its mysteriou
s significance: 
by the rapturous
 joy that lit up
 Karatáev’s 
face as he told 
"it, and the myst"
ic significance 
of that joy.  
    CHAPTER 
XIV  “À vos
 places!” * su
ddenly cried a v
oice.      * �
��To your places
.”   A plea
sant feeling of 
excitement and a
n expectation of
 something joyf
ul and solemn wa
s aroused among 
the soldiers of 
the convoy and t
he prisoners. F
rom all sides ca
me shouts of com
"mand, and from t"
he left came sm
artly dressed ca
valrymen on good
" horses, passing"
 the prisoners a
t a trot. The e
xpression on all
 faces showed th
e tension people
 feel at the ap
proach of those 
in authority. Th
e prisoners thro
nged together an
d were pushed o
ff the road. The
 convoy formed u
p.  “The Emp
eror! The Empero
r! The Marshal! 
The Duke!” and
 hardly had the 
 sleek cavalry p
"assed, before a "
carriage drawn b
y six gray horse
s rattled by. P
ierre caught a g
limpse of a man 
in a three-corne
red hat with a 
tranquil look on
" his handsome, p"
"lump, white face"
. It was one of 
the marshals. H
is eye fell on P
ierre’s large 
and striking fig
"ure, and in
the"
 expression with
 which he frowne
d and looked awa
y Pierre thought
 he detected sy
mpathy and a des
ire to conceal t
hat sympathy.  
 The general in 
charge of the st
ores galloped af
ter the carriage
 with a red and
 frightened face
", whipping up hi"
s skinny horse. 
Several officers
 formed a group
 and some soldie
rs crowded round
 them. Their fac
es all looked e
xcited and worri
ed.  “What d
id he say? What 
did he say?” P
ierre heard them
 ask.  While t
he marshal was p
"assing, the pris"
oners had huddle
d together in a 
"
crowd, and Pier"
re saw Karatáev
 whom he had not
 yet seen that m
orning. He sat 
in his short ove
rcoat leaning ag
ainst a birch tr
"ee. On his face,"
 besides the lo
ok of joyful emo
tion it had worn
 yesterday while
 telling the ta
le of the mercha
nt who suffered 
"innocently, ther"
e was now an ex
pression of quie
t solemnity.  
Karatáev looked
 at Pierre with 
his kindly round
 eyes now filled
" with
tears, ev"
idently wishing 
him to come near
 that he might s
ay something to 
 him. But Pierre
 was not suffici
ently sure of hi
mself. He made a
s if he did not
 notice that loo
k and moved hast
ily away.  Whe
n the prisoners 
again went forwa
rd Pierre looked
 round. Karatáe
v was still sit
ting at the side
 of the road und
er the birch tre
e and two Frenc
hmen were talkin
g over his head.
 Pierre did not 
look round again
 but went limpi
ng up the hill. 
"

From behind, "
where Karatáev 
had been sitting
", came the sound"
 of a shot. Pie
rre heard it pla
"inly, but at tha"
t moment he reme
mbered that he 
had not yet fini
shed reckoning u
p how many stage
s still remained
 to Smolénsk�
�a calculation h
e had begun befo
re the marshal w
ent by. And he 
again started re
ckoning. Two Fre
nch soldiers ran
" past Pierre, on"
e of whom carri
ed a lowered and
 smoking gun. Th
ey both looked p
"ale, and
in the"
 expression on t
heir faces—one
 of them glanced
 timidly at Pie
rre—there was 
something resemb
ling what he had
 seen on the fac
e of the young 
soldier at the e
xecution. Pierre
 looked at the s
oldier and reme
"mbered that, two"
" days before, th"
at man had burne
d his shirt whil
e drying it at 
the fire and how
 they had laughe
d at him.  Beh
"ind him, where K"
aratáev had bee
"n sitting, the d"
og began to howl
. “What a stu
pid beast! Why i
s it howling?”
 thought Pierre.
  His comrades
", the prisoner s"
oldiers walking 
"beside him, avoi"
ded looking bac
k at the place w
here the shot ha
d been fired and
 the dog was how
"ling,
just as P"
"ierre did, but t"
here was a set l
ook on all their
 faces.     
  CHAPTER XV  
"
The stores, the"
" prisoners, and "
the marshal’s 
baggage train st
opped at the vi
llage of Shámsh
evo. The men cro
wded together ro
und the campfire
s. Pierre went 
"up to the fire, "
ate some roast h
"orseflesh, lay d"
own with his ba
"ck to the fire, "
and immediately 
fell asleep. He 
again slept as h
e had done at M
ozháysk after t
he battle of Bor
odinó.  Again
 real events min
gled with dreams
 and again someo
"ne, he or anothe"
"r,
gave express"
ion to his thoug
"hts, and even to"
 the same though
ts that had bee
n expressed in h
is dream at Mozh
áysk.  “Lif
e is everything.
 Life is God. Ev
erything changes
 and moves and t
hat movement is
 God. And while 
there is life th
ere is joy in co
nsciousness of 
the divine. To l
ove life is to l
ove God. Harder 
and more blessed
 than all else 
is to love this 
life in one’s 
"sufferings, in i"
nnocent sufferi
ngs.”  “Ka
ratáev!” came
 to Pierre’s m
ind.  And sudd
enly he saw vivi
dly before him a
" long-forgotten,"
 kindly old man 
 who had given h
im geography les
sons in Switzerl
and. “Wait a b
"it,” said
the"
" old man, and sh"
owed Pierre a gl
obe. This globe 
was alive—a vi
brating ball wi
thout fixed dime
nsions. Its whol
e surface consis
ted of drops cl
osely pressed to
"gether, and all "
these drops move
d and changed pl
"aces,
sometimes"
 several of them
 merging into on
"e, sometimes one"
 dividing into 
many. Each drop 
tried to spread 
out and occupy a
s much space as 
"
possible, but o"
thers striving t
o do the same co
"mpressed it, som"
etimes destroye
"d it, and someti"
mes merged with 
it.  “That i
"s life,” said "
the old teacher.
  “How simpl
e and clear it i
"s,” thought Pi"
erre. “How is 
it I did not kno
w it before?”
  “God is in
" the midst, and "
each drop tries 
to expand so as 
to reflect Him 
to the greatest 
extent. And it g
"rows, merges, di"
sappears from th
"e
surface, sink"
"s to the depths,"
 and again emerg
"es. There now, K"
aratáev has sp
read out and dis
appeared. Do you
" understand, my "
child?” said t
he teacher.  
“Do you unders
"tand, damn you?�"
�� shouted a voi
"ce, and Pierre w"
oke up.  He li
fted himself and
 sat up. A Frenc
hman who had jus
t pushed a Russi
an soldier away
 was squatting b
"y the fire, enga"
ged in roasting 
a piece of meat
 stuck on a ramr
od. His sleeves 
were rolled up a
"nd his sinewy,
"
"hairy, red hands"
 with their shor
t fingers deftly
 turned the ramr
od. His brown m
orose face with 
frowning brows w
as clearly visib
le by the glow o
f the charcoal.
  “It’s al
l the same to hi
"m,” he muttere"
"d, turning quick"
ly to a soldier 
 who stood behin
d him. “Brigan
d! Get away!” 
  And twisting 
the ramrod he lo
oked gloomily at
" Pierre, who tur"
ned away and ga
zed into the dar
kness. A prisone
"r, the Russian s"
oldier the Fren
chman had pushed
" away, was sitti"
ng near the fire
 patting somethi
ng with his han
d. Looking more 
closely Pierre r
ecognized the bl
"ue-gray dog,
si"
tting beside the
" soldier, waggin"
g its tail.  �
"��Ah, he’s com"
e?” said Pierr
e. “And Plat�
"�” he began, b"
ut did not finis
h.  Suddenly a
nd simultaneousl
y a crowd of mem
ories awoke in h
is fancy—of t
he look Platón 
had given him as
 he sat under th
"e tree, of the s"
hot heard from 
"that spot, of th"
"e dog’s howl, "
of the guilty fa
ces of the two 
Frenchmen as the
"y ran past him, "
of the lowered a
"nd smoking gun, "
and of Karatáe
v’s absence at
 this halt—and
 he was on the p
oint of realizin
g that Karatáe
v had been kille
"d, but just at t"
"hat instant, he "
"knew not
why, t"
he recollection 
came to his mind
 of a summer eve
ning he had spen
t with a beauti
ful Polish lady 
on the veranda o
f his house in K
iev. And withou
t linking up the
 events of the d
ay or drawing a 
conclusion from
" them, Pierre cl"
"osed his eyes, s"
eeing a vision o
f the country in
 summertime min
gled with memori
es of bathing an
"d of the liquid,"
 vibrating glob
"e, and he sank i"
nto water so tha
t it closed over
 his head.  Be
fore sunrise he 
was awakened by 
shouts and loud 
and rapid firing
. French soldie
rs were running 
past him.  “
The Cossacks!”
 one of them sho
"uted, and a mome"
nt later a crowd
 of Russians su
rrounded Pierre.
  For a long t
ime he could not
 understand what
 was happening t
o him. All arou
nd he heard his 
comrades sobbing
 with joy.  �
�Brothers! Dear 
fellows! Darling
s!” old soldie
"rs exclaimed, we"
"eping, as
they "
embraced Cossack
s and hussars. 
 The hussars an
d Cossacks crowd
ed round the pri
soners; one offe
red them clothe
"s, another boots"
", and a third br"
ead. Pierre sobb
ed as he sat am
ong them and cou
ld not utter a w
ord. He hugged t
he first soldier
 who approached
" him, and kissed"
" him, weeping.
"
 Dólokhov stoo
d at the gate of
 the ruined hous
"e, letting a cro"
wd of disarmed 
Frenchmen pass b

xcited by all th
at had happened

oudly among them
"selves, but as t"
hey passed Dól
okhov who gently
 switched his bo
ots with his whi
p and watched th
em with cold gl
assy eyes that b
"oded no good, th"
ey became silent
. On the opposi
te side stood D�

"ack, counting th"
e prisoners and 
 marking off eac

Denísov, b"

th a gloomy face
", walked behind "
some Cossacks w
ho were carrying
 the body of Pé

garden.     
  CHAPTER XVI 
 After the twen
ty-eighth of Oct
ober when the fr
"osts began, the "
flight of the F
rench assumed a 
still more tragi
"c character, wit"
"h men freezing,"
 or roasting the
mselves to death
 at the campfire
"s, while carriag"
es with people 
dressed in furs 
continued to dri
"ve past, carryin"
g away the prop
erty that had be
en stolen by the
" Emperor, kings,"
 and dukes; but 
 the process of 
the flight and d
isintegration of
 the French army
 went on essent
ially as before.
  From Moscow 
to Vyázma the F
rench army of se
venty-three thou
sand men not re
ckoning the Guar
ds (who did noth
ing during the w
hole war but pil
lage) was reduc
ed to thirty-six
" thousand, thoug"
h not more than 
five thousand h
ad fallen in bat
tle. From this b
eginning the suc
ceeding terms of
 the progressio
n could be deter
mined mathematic
ally. The French
 army melted aw
ay and perished 
at the same rate
 from Moscow to 
"Vyázma, from Vy"
ázma to Smolé
"nsk, from Smolé"
nsk to the Berë
"zina, and from t"
he Berëzina to 
 Vílna—indepe
ndently of the g
reater or lesser
 intensity of th
"e cold, the
pur"
"suit, the barrin"
"g of the way, or"
 any other parti
cular conditions
. Beyond Vyázm
a the French arm
y instead of mov
ing in three col
umns huddled to
gether into one 
"mass, and so wen"
t on to the end.
 Berthier wrote 
to his Emperor 
(we know how far
 commanding offi
cers allow thems
elves to diverge
 from the truth
 in describing t
he condition of 
an army) and thi
s is what he sa
id:   I deem 
it my duty to re
port to Your Maj
esty the conditi
on of the variou
s corps I have 
had occasion to 
observe during d
ifferent stages 
of the last two
 or three days�
� march. They ar

oldiers remain w
ith the standard
s of their regim
"ents, the others"
 go off by them
selves in differ
ent directions h
oping to find fo
od and escape d
iscipline. In ge
neral they regar
d Smolénsk as t
he place where 
they hope to rec
over. During the
 last few days m
any of the men h
ave been seen t

ir cartridges an

 such a state o
"f affairs, whate"
ver your ultimat

the interest of 
Your Majesty’

s that the army 
should be rallie

and should first
 of all be freed
 from ineffectiv

 unnecessary bag

in proportion to
 the present for

out with hunger
" and fatigue, ne"
ed these supplie
s as well as a f
ew days’ rest.
 Many have died
 these last days
 on the road or 
at the bivouacs.
 This state of 
things is contin
ually becoming w
orse and makes o
ne fear that un
less a prompt re
medy is applied 
the troops will 
no longer be und

  They all wen

ugh they pretend

  CHAPTER XVII 
  The movements
 of the Russian 
and French armie
s during the cam
paign from Mosc
ow back to the N
iemen were like 
those in a game 
of Russian blin
"dman’s buff, i"
n which two play
ers are blindfol
ded and one of 
them occasionall
y rings a little
 bell to inform 
the catcher of h
is whereabouts.
 First he rings 
his bell fearles
"sly, but when he"
 gets into a ti
ght place he run
s away as quietl
"y as he can, and"
 often thinking 
to escape runs 
straight into hi
s opponent’s a
rms.  At first
 while they were

"road, Napoleon�"
�s armies made 
their presence k

when they reache
d the Smolénsk
 road they ran h
olding the clapp
er of their bell
 tight—and oft
en thinking the
y were escaping 
ran right into t
he Russians.  
Owing to the rap
idity of the Fre
nch flight and t
he Russian pursu
it and the cons
equent exhaustio
"n of the horses,"
 the chief means
 of approximate
ly ascertaining 
the enemy’s po
sition—by cava
lry scouting—w
as not availabl
"e. Besides, as a"
 result of the f
requent and rapi
d change of pos
ition by each ar
"my, even what in"
formation was ob
tained could not
 be delivered i
n time. If news 
was received one
 day that the en

 a certain posit
ion the day befo
"re, by the third"
 day when someth
ing could have 
"been done, that "
army was already
 two days’ mar
ch farther on a
nd in quite anot
her position.  
 One army fled a
nd the other pur
sued. Beyond Smo
lénsk there wer
e several diffe
rent roads avail
able for the Fre
"nch, and one wou"
ld have thought 
 that during the
ir stay of four 
days they might 
have learned whe
re the enemy wa
"s, might have ar"
ranged some more
 advantageous pl
an and undertak
en something new
. But after a fo
ur days’ halt 
"the mob, with no"

n running along 
the beaten track
", neither
to th"
e right nor to t
he left but alon
g the old—the 
"worst—road, th"
rough Krásnoe 
and Orshá.  E
xpecting the ene

 the French sepa
rated in their 
flight and sprea
d out over a dis
tance of twenty-
four hours. In 
front of them al
l fled the Emper

" army, expecting"
 Napoleon to tak

e right beyond 
the Dnieper—wh
ich was the only
 reasonable thin
g for him to do�
��themselves tu
rned to the righ
t and came out o
nto the highroad
 at Krásnoe. An
d here as in a 
game of blindman
’s buff the Fr
ench ran into ou
r vanguard. Seei
ng their enemy 
unexpectedly the
 French fell int
o confusion and 
stopped short f
rom the sudden f
"right, but then "
they resumed the
"ir flight,
aban"
doning their com

arther behind. T
hen for three da
ys separate por

 Murat’s (the 
"vice-king’s),"

"baggage, their a"
"rtillery, and ha"
"lf their men, an"
"d fled, getting "
past the Russia

aking semicircle
s to the right. 
"

Ney, who came"
" last, had been "
busying himself 
blowing up the w
alls of Smolén
sk which were in
" nobody’s way,"
 because despite
 the unfortunate
 plight of the 
French or becaus
"e of it, they wi"
shed to punish t

". Ney, who had h"
ad a corps of te

 reached Napoleo

"all his cannon, "
and having cross

at night by stea
lth at a wooded

arther along the
" road to Vílna,"
 still playing 
at blindman’s 
buff with the pu
rsuing army. At 
the Berëzina th
ey again became
" disorganized, m"
any were drowned
 and many surren

 who got across
 the river fled 
farther. Their s
upreme chief don

HAPTER XVIII  
This campaign co
nsisted in a fli

hey did all the
y could to destr
oy themselves. F
rom the time the
y turned onto t
he Kalúga road 
to the day their
 leader fled fro
"m the army, none"
 of the movemen

had any sense. S
o one might have
 thought that r
egarding this pe
riod of the camp
aign the histori

ted the actions
 of the mass to 
the will of one 
"man, would have "
found it imposs
ible to make the
 story of the re

theory. But no!
 Mountains of bo
oks have been wr
itten by the his
torians about th
"is

d everywhere are
 described Napol

maneu"

he military gen
ius shown by his
 marshals.  Th

álo-Yaroslávet

free road into a
 well-supplied 
district and the
 parallel road w
as open to him a
long which Kut�

pursued him—th
is unnecessary r
etreat along a 
devastated road�
��is explained t
o us as being du
e to profound c
onsiderations. S
imilarly profoun
d considerations
 are given for 
his retreat from
 Smolénsk to Or
shá. Then his h
eroism at Krásn
oe is described
", where he is re"
ported to have b
een prepared to 
accept battle a
nd take personal
" command, and to"
 have walked abo
ut with a birch 
stick and said:
  “J’ai as
sez fait l’emp
ereur; il est te
mps de faire le 
"général,” * "
but nevertheles
s immediately ra
"n away again, ab"
andoning to its 
fate the scatte
red fragments of
 the army he lef
t behind.     
  * “I have ac
ted the Emperor 
long enough; it 
is time to act 
     the general
.”   Then w
e are told of th
e greatness of s
oul of the marsh
"als, especially"
 of Ney—a grea
tness of soul co
nsisting in this
: that he made h
is way by night
 around through 
the forest and a
cross the Dniepe
r and escaped to
"
Orshá, abando"
"ning standards, "
"artillery, and n"
ine tenths of hi
s men.  And la
"stly, the final "
departure of the
 great Emperor f
rom his heroic 
army is presente
d to us by the h
istorians as som
ething great and
 characteristic
 of genius. Even
 that final runn
"ing away, descri"
bed in ordinary
 language as the
 lowest depth of
 baseness which 
every child is 
taught to be ash
amed of—even t
hat act finds ju
stification in t
he historians�
� language.  W
hen it is imposs
ible to stretch 
the very elastic
 threads of hist
orical ratiocin
ation any farthe
"r, when actions "
are clearly cont
rary to all tha
t humanity calls
 right or even j
"ust, the histori"
ans produce a sa
ving conception
 of “greatness
.” “Greatnes
"s,” it seems, "
excludes the sta
ndards of right
 and wrong. For 
the “great” 
man nothing is w
"rong, there is n"
o atrocity for 
which a “great
” man can be b
lamed.  “C�
�est grand!” *
 say the histori
"ans, and there n"
o longer exists 
either good or 
evil but only �
�grand” and �
�not grand.” G
"rand is good, no"
t grand is bad.
 Grand is the ch
"aracteristic, in"
 their conceptio
"n, of some
spec"
ial animals call
ed “heroes.”
" And Napoleon, e"
scaping home in 
a warm fur coat
 and leaving to 
perish those who
 were not merely
 his comrades b
ut were (in his 
opinion) men he 
had brought ther
"e, feels que c�"
"�est

) and his soul i
s tranquil.   
    * “It is g

 * (2) That it i

w something subl

e. And the whole
 world for fifty
 years has been

��From the subli

it occurs to no 
one that to admi
t a greatness no
t commensurable 
with the standa

to admit one’s
 own nothingness
 and immeasurab
le meanness.  
For us with the

PTER XIX  What
" Russian, readin"
g the account of
 the last part o
f the campaign 
"of 1812, has not"
 experienced an 
uncomfortable fe
"eling of regret,"
 dissatisfactio
"n, and perplexit"
y? Who has not a
sked himself how
 it is that the
 French were not
 all captured or
 destroyed when 
our three armies
 surrounded the
m in superior nu
"mbers, when the "
disordered Frenc
"h, hungry
and f"
"reezing, surrend"
"ered in crowds, "
and when (as the
 historians rela
te) the aim of 
the Russians was
 to stop the Fre
"nch, to cut them"
" off, and
captu"
re them all?  
How was it that 
the Russian army
", which when num"
erically weaker 
than the French
 had given battl
"e at Borodinó, "
did not achieve 
its purpose when
 it had surroun
ded the French o
n three sides an
d when its aim w
as to capture t
hem? Can the Fre
nch be so enormo
usly superior to
 us that when we
 had surrounded
 them with super
ior forces we co
uld not beat the
m? How could th
at happen?  Hi
story (or what i
s called by that
 name) replying 
to these questio
ns says that th
is occurred beca
use Kutúzov and
 Tormásov and C
"hichagóv, and
"
this man and tha
"t man, did not e"
xecute such and 
such maneuvers..
..  But why di
d they not execu
te those maneuve
rs? And why if t
hey were guilty
 of not carrying
 out a prearrang
ed plan were the
y not tried and 
 punished? But e
ven if we admitt
ed that Kutúzov
", Chichagóv, an"
d others were t
he cause of the 
Russian failures
", it is still in"
comprehensible 
"why, the positio"
n of the Russian
 army being what
 it was at Krás
noe and at the 
Berëzina (in bo
th cases we had 
superior forces)
", the French arm"
y with its mars
"hals, kings, and"
 Emperor was not
" captured, if th"
at was what the
 Russians aimed 
at.  The expla
nation of this s
trange fact give
n by Russian mil
itary historian
s (to the effect
 that Kutúzov h
indered an attac
"k) is unfounded,"
 for we know th
at he could not 
restrain the tro
ops from attacki
ng at Vyázma a
nd Tarútino.  
 Why was the Rus
sian army—whic
h with inferior 
forces had withs
tood the enemy 
in full strength
 at Borodinó—
defeated at Krá
snoe and the Ber
ëzina by the d
isorganized crow
ds of the French
 when it was num
erically superi
or?  If the ai
m of the Russian
s consisted in c
utting off and c
apturing Napole
on and his marsh
als—and that a
im was not merel
y frustrated but
 all attempts t
o attain it were
 most shamefully
 baffled—then 
this last period
 of the campaig
n is quite right
ly considered by
 the French to b
e a series of v
"ictories, and qu"
ite wrongly cons
idered victoriou
s by Russian hi
storians.  The
 Russian militar
y historians in 
so far as they s
ubmit to claims 
 of logic must a
dmit that conclu
"sion, and in spi"
te of their lyri
cal rhapsodies 
"about valor, dev"
"otion, and so fo"
"rth, must reluct"
antly admit tha
t the French ret
reat from Moscow
 was a series of
 victories for 
Napoleon and def
eats for Kutúzo
v.  But puttin
g national vanit
y entirely aside
 one feels that 
such a conclusi
on involves a co
"ntradiction, sin"
ce the series of
 French victori
es brought the F
rench complete d
"estruction, whil"
e the series of
 Russian defeats
 led to the tota
l destruction of
 their enemy and
 the liberation
 of their countr
y.  The source
 of this contrad
iction lies in t
he fact that the
 historians stu
dying the events
 from the letter
s of the soverei
gns and the gene
"rals,
from memo"
"irs, reports, pr"
"ojects, and so f"
"orth, have attri"
buted to this l
ast period of th
e war of 1812 an
 aim that never 
"existed, namely "
that of cutting
 off and capturi
ng Napoleon with
 his marshals an
d his army.  T
here never was o
r could have bee
"n such an aim, f"
or it would have
 been senseless
 and its attainm
ent quite imposs
ible.  It woul
d have been sens
"eless, first bec"
ause Napoleon’
s disorganized 
army was flying 
from Russia with
 all possible sp
"eed, that is to "
"say, was
doing "
just what every 
Russian desired.
 So what was the
 use of performi
ng various oper
ations on the Fr
ench who were ru
nning away as fa
st as they poss
ibly could?  S
"econdly, it woul"
d have been sens
eless to block t
he passage of me
n whose whole e
nergy was direct
ed to flight.  
"
Thirdly, it wou"
ld have been sen
seless to sacrif
ice one’s own 
troops in order
 to destroy the 
"French army, whi"
ch without exter
nal interference
 was destroying
 itself at such 
"a rate that, tho"
ugh its path was
" not
blocked, i"
t could not carr
y across the fro
ntier more than 
it actually did
" in December, na"
mely a hundredth
 part of the ori
ginal army.  F
"ourthly, it woul"
d have been sens
eless to wish to
 take captive th
"e
Emperor, king"
"s, and dukes—w"
hose capture wou
ld have been in 
the highest deg
ree embarrassing
 for the Russian
"s, as the most a"
droit diplomatis
ts of the time 
(Joseph de Maist
re and others) r
ecognized. Still
 more senseless 
 would have been
 the wish to cap
ture army corps 
"of the French, w"
hen our own arm
y had melted awa
y to half before
 reaching Krásn
oe and a whole 
division would h
ave been needed 
to convoy the co
rps of prisoners
", and
when our "
men were not alw
ays getting full
 rations and the
 prisoners alre
ady taken were p
erishing of hung
er.  All the p
rofound plans ab
out cutting off 
and capturing Na
poleon and his 
army were like t
he plan of a mar
ket gardener who
", when driving o"
ut of his garde
n a cow that had
 trampled down t
he beds he had p
"lanted, should
"
run to the gate 
and hit the cow 
on the head. The
 only thing to b
e said in excus
e of that garden
er would be that
 he was very ang
ry. But not even
 that could be 
said for those w
ho drew up this 
"project, for it "
was not they wh
o had suffered f
rom the trampled
 beds.  But be
sides the fact t
hat cutting off 
Napoleon with hi
s army would hav
e been senseles
"s, it was imposs"
ible.  It was 
impossible first
 because—as ex
perience shows t
hat a three-mile
 movement of co
lumns on a battl
efield never coi
ncides with the 
plans—the pro
bability of Chic
"hagóv, Kutúzov"
", and Wittgenste"
in effecting a j
unction on time
 at an appointed
 place was so re
mote as to be ta
ntamount to imp
"ossibility, as i"
n fact thought K
"utúzov, who whe"
n he received th
e plan remarked
 that diversions
 planned over gr
eat distances do
 not yield the 
desired results.
  Secondly it 
"was impossible, "
because to paral
yze the momentum
 with which Nap
oleon’s army w
"as retiring, inc"
omparably greate
r forces than th
e Russians poss
essed would have
 been required. 
  Thirdly it wa
"s impossible, be"
cause the milita
ry term “to cu
t off” has no 
 meaning. One ca
n cut off a slic
"e of bread, but "
not an army. To 
cut off an army
—to bar its ro
ad—is quite im
"possible, for th"
ere is always pl
enty of room to
 avoid capture a
nd there is the 
night when nothi
"ng can be
seen,"
 as the military
 scientists migh
t convince thems
elves by the ex
ample of Krásno
e and of the Ber
ëzina. It is on
ly possible to c
apture prisoner
s if they agree 
"to be captured, "
just as it is on
ly possible to 
catch a swallow 
if it settles on
 one’s hand. M
en can only be t
aken prisoners 
if they surrende
r according to t
he rules of stra
tegy and tactic
"s, as the German"
s did. But the F
rench troops qui
te rightly did n
ot consider tha
t this suited th
"em, since death "
by hunger and co
ld awaited them
 in flight or ca
ptivity alike. 
 Fourthly and c
hiefly it was im
"possible, becaus"
e never since th
e world began h
as a war been fo
ught under such 
conditions as th
ose that obtaine
"d
in 1812, and "
the Russian army
 in its pursuit 
of the French st
rained its stre
ngth to the utmo
st and could not
 have done more 
without destroyi
ng itself.  D
uring the moveme
nt of the Russia
n army from Tar�
�tino to Krásno
e it lost fifty
 thousand sick o
"r stragglers, th"
at is a number e
qual to the pop
ulation of a lar
ge provincial to
wn. Half the men
 fell out of the
 army without a
 battle.  And 
it is of this pe
riod of the camp
aign—when the 
army lacked boot
s and sheepskin
" coats, was shor"
t of provisions 
and without vodk
"a, and
was camp"
ing out at night
 for months in t
he snow with fif
teen degrees of
" frost, when the"
re were only sev
en or eight hour
s of daylight an
d the rest was 
night in which t
he influence of 
discipline canno
t be maintained
", when men were "
taken into that 
region of death 
where disciplin
"e fails, not for"
 a few hours onl
y as in a battle
", but for
month"
"s, where they we"
re every moment 
fighting death f
rom hunger and 
"cold, when half "
the army perishe
d in a single mo
nth—it is of t
his period of t
he campaign that
 the historians 
tell us how Milo
rádovich should
 have made a fl
ank march to suc
h and such a pla
"ce, Tormásov to"
" another place,"
 and Chichagóv 
should have cros
sed (more than k
nee-deep in snow
) to somewhere 
"else, and how so"
-and-so “route
d” and “cut 
off” the Frenc
h and so on and
 so on.  The R
"ussians, half of"
" whom died, did "
all that could a
nd should have b
een done to att
ain an end worth
"y of the nation,"
 and they are no
t to blame beca
use other Russia
"ns, sitting in w"
"arm rooms, propo"
sed that they sh
ould do what wa
s impossible.  
 All that strang
e contradiction 
now difficult to
 understand betw
een the facts a
nd the historica
l accounts only 
arises because t
he historians d
ealing with the 
matter have writ
ten the history 
of the beautiful
 words and sent
iments of variou
"s generals, and "
not the history 
of the events. 
 To them the wo
rds of Milorádo
vich seem very i
"nteresting, and "
so do their sur
mises and the re
wards this or th
at general recei
ved; but the que
stion of those 
fifty thousand m
en who were left
 in hospitals an
d in graves doe
s not even inter
"est them, for it"
 does not come w
ithin the range 
of their invest
igation.  Yet 
one need only di
scard the study 
of the reports a
nd general plans
 and consider t
he movement of t
hose hundreds of
 thousands of me
n who took a di
rect part in the
" events, and all"
 the questions t
hat seemed insol
uble easily and
 simply receive 
an immediate and
 certain solutio
n.  The aim of
 cutting off Nap
oleon and his ar
my never existed
 except in the 
imaginations of 
a dozen people. 
It could not exi
st because it wa
s senseless and
 unattainable. 
 The people had
 a single aim: t
o free their lan
d from invasion.
 That aim was a
ttained in the f
irst place of it
"self, as the Fre"
"nch ran away,
a"
nd so it was onl
y necessary not 
to stop their fl
ight. Secondly i
t was attained 
by the guerrilla
 warfare which w
as destroying th
"e French, and
t"
hirdly by the fa
ct that a large 
Russian army was
 following the F
"rench,
ready to"
 use its strengt
h in case their 
movement stopped
.  The Russian
 army had to act
 like a whip to 
a running animal
. And the exper
ienced driver kn
ew it was better
 to hold the whi
p raised as a m
enace than to st
rike the running
 animal on the h
ead.      
BOOK FIFTEEN: 18

  CHAPTER I  
When seeing a dy
ing animal a man
 feels a sense o
f horror: substa
nce similar to 
his own is peris
hing before his 
eyes. But when i
t is a beloved 
and intimate hum
an being that is
" dying, besides "
this horror at 
the extinction o
f life there is 
"a severance, a s"
"piritual wound, "
which like a ph
ysical wound is 
sometimes fatal 
and sometimes he
"als, but always"
 aches and shrin
ks at any extern
al irritating to
uch.  After Pr
ince Andrew’s 
death Natásha a
nd Princess Mary
 alike felt this
. Drooping in s
pirit and closin
g their eyes bef
ore the menacing
 cloud of death
 that overhung t
"hem, they dared "
not look life in
 the face. They 
 carefully guard
ed their open wo
unds from any ro
ugh and painful 
contact. Everyt
hing: a carriage
 passing rapidly
" in the street, "
a summons to di
"nner, the maid�"
�s inquiry what 
dress to prepare
", or worse still"
 any word of in
sincere or feebl
"e sympathy, seem"
"ed an insult, pa"
infully irritat
"ed the wound, in"
terrupting that 
necessary quiet 
in which they b
oth tried to lis
ten to the stern
 and dreadful ch
oir that still 
resounded in the
"ir imagination, "
and hindered the
ir gazing into t
hose mysterious
 limitless vista
s that for an in
stant had opened
 out before the
m.  Only when 
alone together w
ere they free fr
om such outrage 
and pain. They 
spoke little eve
n to one another
", and when they "
did it was of ve
ry unimportant 
matters.  Both
 avoided any all
usion to the fut
ure. To admit th
e possibility of
 a future seeme
d to them to ins
ult his memory. 
Still more caref
ully did they a
void anything re
lating to him wh
o was dead. It s
eemed to them th
at what they ha
d lived through 
and experienced 
could not be exp
ressed in words
", and that any r"
eference to the 
details of his l
ife infringed th
e majesty and s
acredness of the
 mystery that ha
d been accomplis
hed before thei
r eyes.  Conti
nued abstention 
"from speech, and"
 constant avoida
nce of everythin
g that might le
ad up to the sub

"Princess Mary, i"
n her position a
s absolute and i
ndependent arbit
er of her own f
ate and guardian
 and instructor 
"of her nephew, w"
as the first to 
 be called back 
to life from tha
t realm of sorro
w in which she h
ad dwelt for th
e first fortnigh
t. She received 
letters from her
 relations to w
hich she had to 
reply; the room 
in which little 
Nicholas had bee
n put was damp 
and he began to 
cough; Alpátych
 came to Yarosl�
�vl with reports
 on the state o
f their affairs 
and with advice 
and suggestions 
that they shoul
d return to Mosc
ow to the house 
on the Vozdvízh
"enka Street, whi"
ch had remained
 uninjured and n
eeded only sligh
t repairs. Life 
did not stand s
till and it was 
necessary to liv
e. Hard as it wa
s for Princess 
Mary to emerge f
rom the realm of
 secluded contem
plation in which
 she had lived 
"till then, and s"
orry and almost 
ashamed as she f
elt to leave Na
"tásha alone, ye"
t the cares of l
ife demanded her
 attention and s
he involuntaril
y yielded to the
m. She went thro
ugh the accounts
 with Alpátych
", conferred with"
 Dessalles about
" her nephew, and"
 gave orders and
 made preparati
ons for the jour
ney to Moscow. 
 Natásha remai
"ned alone and, f"
rom the time Pri
ncess Mary began
 making prepara
tions for depart
"ure, held aloof "
from her too.  
 Princess Mary a
sked the countes
s to let Natásh
a go with her to
" Moscow,
and bo"
th parents gladl
y accepted this 
"offer, for they "
saw their daught
er losing stren
gth every day an
d thought that a
 change of scene
 and the advice
 of Moscow docto
rs would be good
 for her.  “
I am not going a
"nywhere,” Nat�"
�sha replied whe
n this was propo
sed to her. “
Do please just l
eave me alone!�
� And she ran ou
"t of the room, w"
ith difficulty 
refraining from 
tears of vexatio
n and irritation
 rather than of
 sorrow.  Afte
r she felt herse
lf deserted by P
rinces Mary and 
alone in her gri
"ef,
Natásha sp"
ent most of the 
time in her room
" by herself, sit"
ting huddled up
 feet and all in
 the corner of t
"he sofa, tearing"
 and twisting s
omething with he
r slender nervou
s fingers and ga
zing intently an
d fixedly at wh
atever her eyes 
chanced to fall 
on. This solitud
e exhausted and
 tormented her b
ut she was in ab
solute need of i
t. As soon as an
yone entered sh
e got up quickly
", changed her po"
sition and expre
"ssion, and
pick"
ed up a book or 
"some sewing, evi"
dently waiting i
mpatiently for t
he intruder to 
go.  She felt 
all the time as 
if she might at 
any moment penet
rate that on wh
ich—with a ter
rible questionin
g too great for 
her strength—h
er spiritual ga
ze was fixed.  
 One day toward 
the end of Decem
"ber Natásha, pa"
"le and thin, dre"
ssed in a black
" woolen gown, he"
r plaited hair n
egligently twist
"ed into a knot, "
was crouched fe
et and all in th
e corner of her 
"sofa, nervously "
crumpling and s
moothing out the
 end of her sash
 while she looke
d at a corner of
 the door.  S
he was gazing in
 the direction i
n which he had g
one—to the oth
er side of life
. And that other
" side of life, o"
f which she had 
never before th
ought and which 
had formerly see
med to her so fa
r away and impro
"bable,
was now "
nearer and more 
akin and more co
mprehensible tha
n this side of 
"life, where ever"
ything was eithe
r emptiness and 
desolation or su
ffering and ind
ignity.  She w
as gazing where 
she knew him to 
be; but she coul
d not imagine hi
m otherwise tha
n as he had been
 here. She now s
aw him again as 
he had been at 
"Mytíshchi, at T"
"róitsa, and at "
Yaroslávl.  S
"he saw his face,"
 heard his voice
", repeated his w"
ords and her own
", and
sometimes"
 devised other w
ords they might 
have spoken.  
There he is lyin
g back in an arm
chair in his vel
"vet cloak, leani"
ng his head on 
his thin pale ha
nd. His chest is
 dreadfully holl
ow and his shou
lders raised. Hi
s lips are firml
"y closed, his ey"
"es glitter, and "
a wrinkle comes
 and goes on his
 pale forehead. 
One of his legs 
twitches just p
"erceptibly, but "
rapidly. Natásh
a knows that he 
is struggling wi
th terrible pai
n. “What is th
at pain like? Wh
y does he have t
hat pain? What 
does he feel? Ho
w does it hurt h
im?” thought N
atásha. He noti
ced her watchin
"g him, raised hi"
"s eyes, and bega"
n to speak serio
usly:  “One 
thing would be t
"errible,” said"
 he: “to bind 
oneself forever 
to a suffering 
man. It would be
 continual tortu
re.” And he lo
oked searchingly
 at her. Natás
ha as usual answ
ered before she 
had time to thin
k what she woul
d say. She said:
 “This can’t
 go on—it won�
��t. You will ge
t well—quite 
well.”  She 
now saw him from
 the commencemen
t of that scene 
and relived what
 she had then f
elt. She recalle
d his long sad a
nd severe look a
t those words a
nd understood th
e meaning of the
 rebuke and desp
air in that prot
racted gaze.  
"
“I agreed,”"
 Natásha now sa
"id to herself, �"
��that it would 
be dreadful if 
he always contin
ued to suffer. I
 said it then on
ly because it wo
uld have been d
"readful for him,"
 but he understo
od it differentl
y. He thought it
 would be dread
ful for me. He t
hen still wished
 to live and fea
red death. And 
I said it so awk
wardly and stupi
dly! I did not s
ay what I meant.
 I thought quit
e differently. H
ad I said what I
" thought, I shou"
ld have said: e
ven if he had to
" go on dying, to"
 die continually
" before my eyes,"
 I should have 
been happy compa
red with what I 
am now. Now ther
e is nothing...
 nobody. Did he 
"know that? No, h"
e did not and ne
ver will know i
t. And now it wi
"ll never, never "
be possible to p
ut it right.” 
And now he agai
n seemed to be s
aying the same w
"ords to her, onl"
y in her imagin
ation Natásha t
his time gave hi
m a different an
swer. She stoppe
d him and said:
 “Terrible for
" you, but not fo"
r me! You know t
hat for me ther
e is nothing in 
"life but you, an"
d to suffer with
 you is the grea
test happiness 
"for me,” and h"
e took her hand 
and pressed it a
s he had presse
d it that terrib
le evening four 
days before his 
death. And in he
r imagination s
he said other te
nder and loving 
words which she 
might have said
 then but only s
poke now: “I l
ove thee!... the
"e! I love, love."
"..”
she said,"
 convulsively pr
essing her hands
 and setting her
 teeth with a d
esperate effort.
...  She was o
vercome by sweet
 sorrow and tear
s were already r
ising in her ey
es; then she sud
denly asked hers
elf to whom she 
was saying this.
 Again everythi
ng was shrouded 
"in hard, dry per"
"plexity, and aga"
in with a strai
ned frown she pe
ered toward the 
world where he w
"as. And now, now"
 it seemed to h
er she was penet
rating the myste
ry.... But at th
e instant when 
it seemed that t
he incomprehensi
ble was revealin
g itself to her 
a loud rattle o
f the door handl
e struck painful
ly on her ears. 
"Dunyásha,
her "
"maid, entered th"
e room quickly a
nd abruptly with
 a frightened lo
ok on her face 
and showing no c
oncern for her m
istress.  “C
ome to your Papa
" at once, please"
!” said she wi
"th a strange, ex"
cited look. “
A misfortune... 
about Peter Ilý
nich... a letter
",” she finishe"
d with a sob. 
     CHAPTE
R II  Besides 
a feeling of alo
ofness from ever
ybody Natásha w
as feeling a sp
ecial estrangeme
nt from the memb
ers of her own f
amily. All of t
hem—her father
", mother, and S�"
�nya—were so n
"ear to her, so f"
"amiliar, so
com"
"monplace, that a"
ll their words a
nd feelings seem
ed an insult to 
the world in wh
ich she had been
" living of late,"
 and she felt no
t merely indiff
erent to them bu
t regarded them 
with hostility. 
She heard Duny�
�sha’s words a
bout Peter Ilýn
ich and a misfor
"tune, but did no"
t grasp them. 
 “What misfor
tune? What misfo
rtune can happen
 to them? They j
ust live their 
"own old, quiet, "
and commonplace 
"life,” thought"
 Natásha.  As
 she entered the
 ballroom her fa
ther was hurried
ly coming out of
 her mother’s
 room. His face 
was puckered up 
and wet with tea
rs. He had evid
ently run out of
 that room to gi
ve vent to the s
obs that were c
hoking him. When
 he saw Natásha
 he waved his ar
ms despairingly 
and burst into 
convulsively pai
nful sobs that d
istorted his sof
t round face.  
 “Pe... Pétya
"... Go, go, she."
.. is calling...
” and weeping 
like a child an
d quickly shuffl
ing on his feebl
e legs to a chai
"r, he almost fel"
"l into
it, cove"
ring his face wi
th his hands.  
 Suddenly an ele
ctric shock seem
ed to run throug
h Natásha’s w
hole being. Ter
rible anguish st
"ruck her heart, "
she felt a dread
ful ache as if 
something was be
ing torn inside 
her and she were
 dying. But the 
pain was immedi
ately followed b
y a feeling of r
elease from the 
oppressive cons
traint that had 
prevented her ta
king part in lif
e. The sight of 
"her
father, the"
 terribly wild c
ries of her moth
er that she hear
d through the d
"oor, made her im"
mediately forget
 herself and her
 own grief.  S
he ran to her fa
"ther, but he fee"
bly waved his ar
"m, pointing to h"
er mother’s d
oor. Princess Ma
"ry, pale and wit"
h quivering chin
", came out
from"
 that room and t
aking Natásha b
y the arm said s
omething to her.
 Natásha neith
er saw nor heard
 her. She went i
n with rapid ste
"ps, pausing
at "
the door for an 
instant as if st
ruggling with he
"rself, and then "
ran to her moth
er.  The count
ess was lying in
 an armchair in 
a strange and aw
"kward position,"
 stretching out 
and beating her 
head against the
 wall. Sónya an
d the maids wer
e holding her ar
ms.  “Natás
ha! Natásha!...
” cried the co
untess. “It’
s not true... it
’s not true..
. He’s lying..
. Natásha!” s
"he shrieked, pus"
hing those aroun
d her away. “
"Go away, all of "
you; it’s not 
true! Killed!...
" ha, ha, ha!..."
 It’s not true
!”  Natásha
 put one knee on
" the armchair, s"
tooped over her 
"mother, embraced"
"
her, and with "
unexpected stren
"gth raised her, "
turned her face 
"toward
herself,"
 and clung to he
r.  “Mummy!.
.. darling!... I
" am here, my dea"
"rest Mummy,” s"
he kept on whis
"pering, not paus"
ing an instant. 
  She did not l
et go of her mot
her but struggle
d tenderly with 
"her,
demanded a"
 pillow and hot 
"water, and unfas"
tened and tore o
pen her mother�
��s dress.  �
�My dearest darl
"ing... Mummy, my"
 precious!...”
 she whispered 
"incessantly, kis"
"sing her head, h"
"er hands, her fa"
"ce, and feeling "
her own irrepre
ssible and strea
ming tears tickl
ing her nose and
 cheeks.  The 
countess pressed
 her daughter’
"s hand, closed h"
"er eyes, and bec"
ame quiet for a
 moment. Suddenl
y she sat up wit
h unaccustomed s
"wiftness,
glanc"
ed vacantly arou
"nd her, and seei"
ng Natásha bega
n to press her 
daughter’s hea
d with all her s
trength. Then sh
e turned toward 
her daughter’
s face which was
 wincing with pa
in and gazed lon
g at it.  “N
"atásha, you lov"
e me?” she sai
d in a soft trus
tful whisper. �
"�Natásha,
you "
would not deceiv
e me? You’ll t
ell me the whole
 truth?”  Na
tásha looked at
 her with eyes f
ull of tears and
 in her look the
re was nothing 
but love and an 
entreaty for for
giveness.  “
My darling Mummy
!” she repeate
"d, straining all"
 the power of he
r love to find 
some way of taki
ng on herself th
e excess of grie
f that crushed h
er mother.  A
nd again in a fu
tile struggle wi
th reality her m
"other, refusing "
to believe that
 she could live 
when her beloved
 boy was killed 
in the bloom of
" life, escaped f"
rom reality into
 a world of deli
rium.  Natásh
a did not rememb
er how that day 
passed nor that 
"night, nor the
"
next day and nig
ht. She did not 
sleep and did no
t leave her moth
er. Her perseve
ring and patient
 love seemed com
pletely to surro
und the countess
"
every moment, "
not explaining o
"r consoling, but"
 recalling her t
o life.  Durin
g the third nigh
t the countess k
ept very quiet f
or a few minutes
",
and Natásha "
rested her head 
on the arm of he
r chair and clos
"ed her eyes,
bu"
t opened them ag
ain on hearing t
he bedstead crea
k. The countess 
was sitting up 
in bed and speak
ing softly.  �
��How glad I am 
you have come. Y
ou are tired. Wo
n’t you have s
ome tea?” Nat
ásha went up to
 her. “You hav
e improved in lo
oks and grown mo
"re
manly,” co"
ntinued the coun
"tess, taking her"
 daughter’s ha
nd.  “Mamma!
 What are you sa
ying...”  �
"�Natásha, he is"
" no more, no mor"
e!”  And emb
racing her daugh
"ter, the countes"
s began to weep 
for the first t
ime.      
CHAPTER III  P
rincess Mary pos
tponed her depar
ture. Sónya and
 the count tried
 to replace Nat
ásha but could 
not. They saw th
at she alone was
 able to restra
in her mother fr
om unreasoning d
espair. For thre
e weeks Natásha
 remained const
antly at her mot
"her’s side, sl"
eeping on a loun
ge chair in her
" room, making he"
"r eat and drink,"
 and talking to 
her incessantly 
 because the mer
e sound of her t
"ender, caressing"
 tones soothed h
er mother.  T
he mother’s wo
unded spirit cou
ld not heal. Pé
tya’s death ha
d torn from her
 half her life. 
When the news of
 Pétya’s deat
h had come she h
ad been a fresh
 and vigorous wo
"man of fifty, bu"
t a month later 
she left her roo
m a listless ol
d woman taking n
o interest in li
fe. But the same
 blow that almo
st killed the co
"untess, this sec"
"ond blow, restor"
ed Natásha to l
ife.  A spirit
ual wound produc
ed by a rending 
of the spiritual
 body is like a
 physical wound 
"and, strange as "
"it may seem, jus"
t as a deep woun
d may heal and 
"its edges join, "
physical and spi
ritual wounds al
ike can yet hea
l completely onl
y as the result 
of a vital force
 from within.  
 Natásha’s wo
und healed in th
at way. She thou
ght her life was
" ended,
but her"
 love for her mo
ther unexpectedl
y showed her tha
t the essence of
 life—love—
was still active
 within her. Lov
e awoke and so d
id life.  Prin
ce Andrew’s la
st days had boun
d Princess Mary 
and Natásha tog
ether; this new
 sorrow brought 
them still close
r to one another
. Princess Mary 
 put off her dep
"arture, and for "
three weeks look
ed after Natásh
a as if she had
 been a sick chi
ld. The last wee
ks passed in her
 mother’s bedr
oom had straine
d Natásha’s p
hysical strength
.  One afterno
on noticing Nat�
�sha shivering w
"ith fever, Princ"
ess Mary took h
er to her own ro
om and made her 
lie down on the 
bed. Natásha la
"y down,
but whe"
n Princess Mary 
had drawn the bl
inds and was goi
ng away she cal
led her back.  
 “I don’t wa
"nt to sleep, Mar"
"y, sit by me a l"
ittle.”  “
You are tired—
try to sleep.”
"

“No, no. W"
hy did you bring
 me away? She wi
ll be asking for
 me.”  “Sh
e is much better
. She spoke so w
"ell today,” sa"
id Princess Mary
.  Natásha la
y on the bed and
 in the semidark
ness of the room
 scanned Prince
ss Mary’s face
.  “Is she l
ike him?” thou
ght Natásha. �
"�Yes, like and y"
et not like. But
 she is quite o
"riginal, strange"
", new, and unkno"
wn. And she love
s me. What is i
n her heart? All
 that is good. B
ut how? What is 
her mind like? W
hat does she th
ink about me? Ye
"s, she is splend"
id!”  “Mar
"y,” she said t"
"imidly, drawing "
Princess Mary’
s hand to hersel
"f,
“Mary, you"
 mustn’t think
 me wicked. No? 
"Mary darling, ho"
w I love you! L
"et us be quite, "
quite friends.�
�  And Natásh
"a, embracing her"
", began kissing "
her face and han
"ds, making
Prin"
cess Mary feel s
hy but happy by 
this demonstrati
on of her feelin
gs.  From that
 day a tender an
d passionate fri
endship such as 
exists only bet
ween women was e
stablished betwe
en Princess Mary
 and Natásha. T
hey were contin
ually kissing an
d saying tender 
things to one an
other and spent
 most of their t
ime together. Wh
en one went out 
the other became
 restless and h
astened to rejoi
n her. Together 
they felt more i
n harmony with 
one another than
 either of them 
felt with hersel
f when alone. A 
 feeling stronge
r than friendshi
p sprang up betw
een them; an exc
lusive feeling 
of life being po
ssible only in e
ach other’s pr
esence.  Somet
imes they were s
ilent for hours;
 sometimes after
 they were alrea
dy in bed they 
would begin talk
ing and go on ti
ll morning. They
 spoke most of 
what was long pa
st. Princess Mar
y spoke of her c
"hildhood, of her"
"
mother, her fa"
"ther, and her da"
ydreams; and Nat
"ásha, who with "
a passive lack 
of understanding
 had formerly tu
rned away from t
hat life of dev
"otion, submissio"
"n, and the poetr"
y of Christian s
"elf-sacrifice, n"
ow feeling hers
elf bound to Pri
ncess Mary by af
"fection, learned"
 to love her pa
st too and to un
derstand a side 
of life previous
ly incomprehensi
ble to her. She
 did not think o
f applying submi
ssion and self-a
bnegation to her
"
own life, for "
she was accustom
ed to seek other
" joys, but she u"
nderstood and l
oved in another 
those previously
 incomprehensibl
e virtues. For 
"Princess Mary, l"
istening to Nat�
�sha’s tales o
f childhood and 
"early
youth, th"
ere also opened 
out a new and hi
therto uncompreh
ended side of l
ife: belief in l
ife and its enjo
yment.  Just a
"s before, they n"
ever mentioned h
im so as not to 
lower (as they 
thought) their e
xalted feelings 
by words; but th
is silence about
 him had the ef
fect of making t
hem gradually be
gin to forget hi
m without being 
 conscious of it
.  Natásha ha
d grown thin and
 pale and physic
ally so weak tha
t they all talk
ed about her hea
"lth, and this pl"
eased her. But s
ometimes she was
 suddenly overc
ome by fear not 
only of death bu
"t of sickness, w"
"eakness,
and lo"
ss of good looks
", and involuntar"
ily she examined
 her bare arm c
"arefully, surpri"
sed at its thinn
"ess, and in the "
morning noticed 
"her
drawn and, "
as it seemed to 
"her, piteous fac"
e in her glass. 
It seemed to he
r that things mu
"st be so, and ye"
t it was dreadfu
lly sad.  One 
day she went qui
ckly upstairs an
d found herself 
out of breath. 
Unconsciously sh
e immediately in
vented a reason 
"for going down, "
"and
then, testi"
"ng her strength,"
 ran upstairs ag
"ain, observing t"
he result.  An
other time when 
she called Duny�
�sha her voice t
"rembled, so she "
called again—
though she could
 hear Dunyásha 
coming—called 
her in the deep 
chest tones in 
which she had be
"en wont to sing,"
 and listened at
tentively to he
rself.  She di
d not know and w
ould not have be
"lieved it, but b"
eneath the layer
 of slime that 
covered her soul
 and seemed to h
"er impenetrable,"
 delicate young
 shoots of grass
 were already sp
"routing, which t"
aking root would
 so cover with 
their living ver
dure the grief t
hat weighed her 
down that it wo
uld soon no long
er be seen or no
ticed. The wound
 had begun to he
al from within.
  At the end o
f January Prince
ss Mary left for
" Moscow, and the"
 count insisted
 on Natásha’s
 going with her 
to consult the d
octors.     
  CHAPTER IV  
 After the encou
"nter at Vyázma,"
 where Kutúzov 
had been unable 
to hold back hi
s troops in thei
r anxiety to ove
rwhelm and cut o
ff the enemy and
"
so on, the far"
ther movement of
 the fleeing Fre
"nch, and of the "
Russians who pu
"rsued them, cont"
inued as far as 
Krásnoe without
 a battle. The 
flight was so ra
pid that the Rus
sian army pursui
ng the French co
uld not keep up
 with them; cava
lry and artiller
y horses broke d
"own, and the
in"
formation receiv
ed of the moveme
nts of the Frenc
h was never reli
able.  The men
 in the Russian 
army were so wor
n out by this co
ntinuous marchin
g at the rate o
f twenty-seven m
iles a day that 
they could not g
o any faster. 
 To realize the
 degree of exhau
stion of the Rus
sian army it is 
only necessary 
to grasp clearly
 the meaning of 
"the fact that, w"
hile not losing
 more than five 
thousand killed 
and wounded afte
r Tarútino and 
 less than a hun
"dred prisoners, "
the Russian army
 which left that
 place a hundre
d thousand stron
g reached Krásn
oe with only fif
ty thousand.  
The rapidity of 
the Russian purs
uit was just as 
destructive to o
ur army as the 
flight of the Fr
ench was to thei
rs. The only dif
ference was that
 the Russian ar
my moved volunta
"rily, with no su"
ch threat of des
truction as hun
g over the Frenc
"h, and that the "
sick Frenchmen w
ere left behind 
 in enemy hands 
while the sick R
ussians left beh
ind were among t
heir own people
. The chief caus
e of the wastage
 of Napoleon’s
 army was the r
apidity of its m
"ovement, and a c"
onvincing proof 
of this is the 
corresponding de
crease of the Ru
ssian army.  K
utúzov as far a
s was in his pow
"er, instead of t"
rying to check t
he movement of 
the French as wa
s desired in Pet
ersburg and by t
he Russian army
" generals, direc"
ted his whole ac
"tivity here, as "
he had done at 
Tarútino and Vy
"ázma, to hasten"
ing it on while 
easing the movem
ent of our army
.  But besides
" this, since the"
 exhaustion and 
enormous diminut
ion of the army
 caused by the r
apidity of the a
dvance had becom
"e evident, anoth"
er reason for s
lackening the pa
ce and delaying 
presented itself
 to Kutúzov. T
he aim of the Ru
ssian army was t
o pursue the Fre
nch. The road th
e French would 
take was unknown
", and so the clo"
ser our troops t
rod on their he
els the greater 
distance they ha
d to cover. Only
 by following a
t some distance 
could one cut ac
ross the zigzag 
path of the Fren
ch. All the art
ful maneuvers su
ggested by our g
enerals meant fr
esh movements of
 the army and a
 lengthening of 
"its marches, whe"
reas the only re
asonable aim wa
s to shorten tho
se marches. To t
hat end Kutúzov
’s activity wa
s directed duri
ng the whole cam
paign from Mosco
w to Vílna—no
t casually or i
ntermittently bu
t so consistentl
y that he never 
once deviated fr
om it.  Kutúz
ov felt and knew
—not by reason
ing or science b
ut with the whol
e of his Russia
n being—what e
very Russian sol
dier felt: that 
the French were 
"
beaten, that th"
e enemy was flyi
ng and must be d
riven out; but a
t the same time
 he like the sol
diers realized a
ll the hardship 
"of this march,
"
the rapidity of 
which was unpara
lleled for such 
a time of the ye
ar.  But to th
"e generals, espe"
cially the forei
gn ones in the R
"ussian army,
wh"
o wished to dist
inguish themselv
"es, to astonish "
"somebody, and fo"
r some reason t
o capture a king
 or a duke—it 
seemed that now�
��when any battl
e must be horri
ble and senseles
s—was the very
 time to fight a
nd conquer some
body. Kutúzov m
erely shrugged h
is shoulders whe
n one after ano
ther they presen
ted projects of 
maneuvers to be 
made with those 
 soldiers—ill-
"shod, insufficie"
"ntly clad, and h"
alf starved—wh
o within a mont
h and without fi
ghting a battle 
had dwindled to 
half their numbe
"r,
and who at t"
he best if the f
light continued 
would have to go
 a greater dist
ance than they h
ad already trave
"rsed, before the"
y reached the f
rontier.  This
 longing to dist
inguish themselv
"es, to maneuver,"
" to overthrow, a"
nd to cut off s
howed itself par
ticularly whenev
er the Russians 
stumbled on the
 French army.  
 So it was at Kr
"ásnoe, where th"
ey expected to f
ind one of the t
hree French col
umns and stumble
d instead on Nap
oleon himself wi
th sixteen thou
sand men. Despit
e all Kutúzov�
�s efforts to av
oid that ruinous
 encounter and 
to preserve his 
"troops, the mass"
acre of the brok
en mob of Frenc
h soldiers by wo
rn-out Russians 
continued at Kr�
�snoe for three 
 days.  Toll w
rote a dispositi
on: “The first
 column will mar
"ch to so and so,"
” etc. And as
 usual nothing h
appened in accor
d with the dispo
sition. Prince 
Eugène of Würt
temberg fired fr
om a hill over t
he French crowds
 that were runn
"ing past, and de"
manded reinforce
ments which did 
not arrive. The
" French, avoidin"
"g the Russians, "
dispersed and hi
d themselves in
 the forest by n
"ight, making the"
ir way round as 
"best they could,"
 and continued 
their flight.  
"
Milorádovich, "
who said he did 
not want to know
 anything about 
the commissaria
t affairs of his
" detachment, and"
 could never be 
found when he w
as wanted—that
 chevalier sans 
peur et sans rep
roche * as he st
yled himself—
who was fond of 
parleys with the
" French, sent en"
voys demanding 
"their surrender,"
" wasted time, an"

  And the caval
"ry, with spurs a"

 on horses that 
could scarcely 
"move, trotted wi"
th much effort t
o the column pre
sented to them�
��that is to say
", to a crowd of "
Frenchmen stark 
"with cold,
fros"
"t-bitten, and st"
arving—and the
 column that had
 been presented 
to them threw d
own its arms and
 surrendered as 
it had long been
 anxious to do.
  At Krásnoe 
they took twenty
-six thousand pr
"isoners, several"
 hundred cannon

lled a “marsha

and disputed as

"n, or at least a"

ero of some sort

 one another and
 especially Kut�
�zov for having
 failed to do so
".

These men, "
carried away by 
"their passions, "
were but blind t
ools of the mos
t melancholy law
" of necessity, b"
ut considered th
emselves heroes 
and imagined th
at they were acc

y blamed Kutúzo

"fortable there, "
that at Krásnoe
 he checked the

t Napoleon was t
here he had quit
e lost his head
", and that it wa"
s probable that 
he had an unders
tanding with Na

een bribed by hi

d so on.  Not 
only did his con
"temporaries, car"
ried away by the

"n as grand,

le Kutúzov is d
escribed by fore

"ty, dissolute, w"
eak old courtie

ns as something 
indefinite—a s
ort of puppet u
seful only becau

ian name.    
   CHAPTER V 
 In 1812 and 18
13 Kutúzov was 
openly accused o
f blundering. Th
e Emperor was d
issatisfied with
 him. And in a h
istory recently 
written by order
 of the Highest
 Authorities it 
is said that Kut
úzov was a cunn
"ing court
liar,"
 frightened of t
he name of Napol
"eon, and that by"
 his blunders at
 Krásnoe and t
he Berëzina he 
deprived the Rus
sian army of the
 glory of compl
ete victory over
 the French. *

"e, by Bogdánovi"
ch.  Such is t
he fate not of g
reat men (grands

e Russian mind 
does not acknowl
"edge, but of tho"
se rare and alwa
ys solitary indi
"viduals
who, di"
scerning the wil
"l of Providence,"
 submit their pe
rsonal will to 
it. The hatred a
nd contempt of t
he crowd punish 
such men for dis
cerning the hig
her laws.  For
 Russian histori
"ans, strange and"
 terrible to say
", Napoleon—tha"
t most insignif
icant tool of hi
story who never 
"anywhere, even i"
"n exile, showed"
 human dignity�
�Napoleon is the
 object of adula
tion and enthusi
asm; he is gran
d. But Kutúzov�
��the man who fr
om the beginning
 to the end of h
is activity in 
"1812, never once"
 swerving by wor
d or deed from B
orodinó to Ví
"lna, presented a"
n example except
ional in history
 of self-sacrifi
ce and a presen
t consciousness 
of the future im
portance of what
 was happening�
��Kutúzov seems
 to them somethi
ng indefinite an
"d pitiful, and
"
when speaking of
 him and of the 
year 1812 they a
lways seem a lit
tle ashamed.  
 And yet it is d
ifficult to imag
ine an historica
l character whos
e activity was 
so unswervingly 
directed to a si
ngle aim; and it
 would be diffi
cult to imagine 
any aim more wor
thy or more cons
onant with the 
will of the whol
e people. Still 
more difficult w
ould it be to fi
nd an instance 
in history of th
e aim of an hist
orical personage
 being so compl
etely accomplish
ed as that to wh
ich all Kutúzov
’s efforts wer
e directed in 1
812.  Kutúzov
 never talked of
 “forty centur
ies looking down
 from the Pyram
"ids,” of the s"
acrifices he off
ered for the fat
"herland, or of
"
what he intended
 to accomplish o
r had accomplish
ed; in general h
e said nothing 
"about himself, a"
"dopted no pose, "
always appeared 
to be the simpl
est and most ord
"inary of men, an"
d said the simpl
est and most or
dinary things. H
e wrote letters 
to his daughters
 and to Madame d
"e
Staël, read "
"novels, liked th"
e society of pre
"tty women, jeste"
d with generals
", officers, and "
"soldiers, and ne"
ver contradicted
 those who tried
 to prove anyth
ing to him. When
 Count Rostopch�
�n at the Yaúza
 bridge gallope
d up to Kutúzov
 with personal r
eproaches for ha
ving caused the 
 destruction of 
"Moscow, and said"
: “How was it 
you promised not
 to abandon Mos
cow without a ba
ttle?” Kutúzo
v replied: “An
d I shall not ab
andon Moscow wi
"thout a battle,�"
�� though Moscow
 was then alread
y abandoned. Whe
"n
Arakchéev, c"
oming to him fro
"m the Emperor, s"
aid that Ermólo
v ought to be a
ppointed chief o
"f the artillery,"
 Kutúzov replie
"d: “Yes, I was"
 just saying so
" myself,” thou"
gh a moment befo
re he had said q
uite the contra
ry. What did it 
matter to him—
who then alone a
mid a senseless 
 crowd understoo
d the whole trem
endous significa
nce of what was 
 happening—wha
t did it matter 
to him whether R
ostopchín attri
buted the calam
ities of Moscow 
to him or to him
self? Still less
 could it matter
 to him who was
 appointed chief
 of the artiller
y.  Not merely
 in these cases 
but continually 
did that old man
—who by exper
ience of life ha
d reached the co
nviction that th
oughts and the 
words serving as
 their expressio
n are not what m
ove people—use
 quite meaningl
ess words that h
appened to enter
 his head.  Bu
"t that man, so h"
eedless of his w
"ords, did not on"
ce during the wh
ole time of his
 activity utter 
one word inconsi
stent with the s
ingle aim towar
d which he moved
 throughout the 
whole war. Obvio
usly in spite of
"
himself, in ve"
ry diverse circu
"mstances, he rep"
eatedly expresse
d his real thou
ghts with the bi
tter conviction 
that he would no
t be understood.
 Beginning with
 the battle of B
"orodinó, from w"
hich time his di
sagreement with
 those about him
" began, he alone"
 said that the b
attle of Borodin
ó was a victor
"y, and repeated "
this both verbal
ly and in his di
spatches and re
ports up to the 
time of his deat
h. He alone said
 that the loss o
f Moscow is not
 the loss of Rus
sia. In reply to
 Lauriston’s p
roposal of peac
"e, he said: Ther"
e can be no peac
"e, for such is t"
he people’s wi
ll. He alone du
ring the retreat
 of the French s
aid that all our
 maneuvers are 
"useless, everyth"
ing is being acc
omplished of its
elf better than 
we could desire
; that the enemy
 must be offered
 “a golden bri
dge”; that nei
ther the Tarút
"ino, the Vyázma"
", nor the Krásn"
oe battles were 
necessary; that 
 we must keep so
me force to reac
h the frontier w
"ith, and that he"
 would not sacr
ifice a single R
ussian for ten F
renchmen.  And
" this courtier, "
as he is describ
"ed to us, who li"
es to Arakchéev
 to please the 
"Emperor, he alon"
e—incurring th
ereby the Empero
r’s displeasu
re—said in Ví
lna that to carr
y the war beyond
 the frontier is
 useless and ha
rmful.  Nor do
 words alone pro
ve that only he 
understood the m
eaning of the e
vents. His actio
ns—without the
 smallest deviat
ion—were all d
irected to one 
and the same thr
eefold end: (1) 
to brace all his
 strength for c
onflict with the
" French, (2) to "
"defeat them, and"
 (3) to drive th
em out of Russi
"a, minimizing as"
 far as possible
 the sufferings 
of our people a
nd of our army. 
  This procrast
"inator Kutúzov,"
 whose motto was
 “Patience and
" Time,”
this "
enemy of decisiv
"e action, gave b"
attle at Borodin
"ó, investing th"
e preparations 
for it with unpa
ralleled solemni
ty. This Kutúzo
v who before th
e battle of Aust
erlitz began sai
d that it would 
"be lost, he alon"
"e, in
contradic"
tion to everyone
" else, declared "
till his death t
hat Borodinó w
"as a victory, de"
spite the assura
nce of generals 
that the battle 
was lost and de
spite the fact t
hat for an army 
to have to retir
e after winning
 a battle was un
precedented. He 
alone during the
 whole retreat 
insisted that ba
"ttles, which wer"
"e useless then, "
should not be fo
"ught,
and that "
a new war should
 not be begun no
r the frontiers 
of Russia cross
ed.  It is eas
y now to underst
and the signific
ance of these ev
ents—if only w
e abstain from 
attributing to t
he activity of t
he mass aims tha
t existed only 
in the heads of 
a dozen individu
als—for the ev
ents and results
 now lie before
 us.  But how 
did that old man
", alone, in oppo"
sition to the ge
"neral opinion,
"
so truly discern
 the importance 
of the people’
s view of the ev
ents that in al
l his activity h
e was never once
 untrue to it? 
 The source of 
that extraordina
ry power of pene
trating the mean
ing of the even
ts then occuring
 lay in the nati
onal feeling whi
ch he possessed 
in full purity 
and strength.  
 Only the recogn
ition of the fac
t that he posses
sed this feeling
 caused the peo
ple in so strang
"e a manner, cont"
rary to the Tsar
"’s wish, to
s"
elect him—an o
ld man in disfav
or—to be their
 representative 
in the national
 war. And only t
hat feeling plac
ed him on that h
ighest human pe
destal from whic
"h he, the comman"
"der in chief, de"
voted all his po
wers not to sla
ying and destroy
ing men but to s
aving and showin

utúzov left Kr�

s clear and fros
ty. Kutúzov rod
e to Dóbroe on 
his plump little
"
white horse, f"
ollowed by an en
ormous suite of 
discontented gen
erals who whisp
ered among thems
elves behind his
 back. All along
 the road groups
 of French pris
oners captured t
hat day (there w
ere seven thousa
nd of them) wer
e crowding to wa
rm themselves at
 campfires. Near
 Dóbroe an imme
nse crowd of ta
ttered prisoners
", buzzing with t"
alk and wrapped 
and bandaged in
 anything they h
ad been able to 
"get hold of, wer"
e standing in th
e road beside a
 long row of unh
arnessed French 
guns. At the app
roach of the co
mmander in chief
 the buzz of tal
k ceased and all
 eyes were fixed
 on Kutúzov wh
"o, wearing a whi"
te cap with a re
d band and a pad
ded overcoat th
at bulged on his
 round shoulders
", moved slowly a"
long the road on
 his white hors
e. One of the ge
nerals was repor
ting to him wher
e the guns and 
prisoners had be
en captured.  
Kutúzov seemed 
preoccupied and 
did not listen t
o what the gener
al was saying. 
He screwed up hi
s eyes with a di
ssatisfied look 
as he gazed att
entively and fix
edly at these pr
"isoners, who pre"
sented a special
ly wretched app
earance. Most of
 them were disfi
gured by frost-b
itten noses and
" cheeks, and nea"
"rly all had red,"
 swollen and fes
tering eyes.  
One group of the
 French stood cl
"ose to the road,"
 and two of them
", one of
whom h"
ad his face cove
"red with sores, "
were tearing a p
iece of raw fle
sh with their ha
nds. There was s
omething horribl
e and bestial in
 the fleeting g
lance they threw
 at the riders a
nd in the malevo
lent expression
" with which, aft"
er a glance at K
"utúzov, the sol"
dier with the s
ores immediately
 turned away and
 went on with wh
at he was doing.
  Kutúzov loo
ked long and int
ently at these t
wo soldiers. He 
puckered his fa
"ce, screwed up h"
"is eyes, and pen"
sively swayed hi
s head. At anoth
er spot he noti
ced a Russian so
ldier laughingly
 patting a Frenc
hman on the sho
"ulder, saying so"
mething to him i
n a friendly man
"ner, and Kutúzo"
v with the same
 expression on h
is face again sw
ayed his head. 
 “What were y
ou saying?” he
 asked the gener
"al, who continui"
ng his report d
irected the comm
ander in chief�
�s attention to 
some standards c
aptured from th
e French and sta
nding in front o
f the Preobrazh�

"
“Ah, the sta"
ndards!” said 
"Kutúzov, eviden"
tly detaching hi
mself with diff
iculty from the 
thoughts that pr
eoccupied him. 
 He looked abou
t him absently. 
Thousands of eye
s were looking a
t him from all 
sides awaiting a
 word from him. 
  He stopped in
 front of the Pr
eobrazhénsk reg
"iment, sighed de"
"eply, and
close"
d his eyes. One 
of his suite bec
koned to the sol
diers carrying 
the standards to
 advance and sur
round the comman
der in chief wit
h them. Kutúzo
v was silent for
 a few seconds a
"nd then, submitt"
ing with evident
 reluctance to 
the duty imposed
 by his position
", raised his hea"
d and began to 
speak. A throng 
of officers surr
ounded him. He l
ooked attentive
ly around at the
 circle of offic
"ers, recognizing"
 several of the
m.  “I thank
 you all!” he 
"said, addressing"
 the soldiers an
d then again the
 officers. In t
he stillness aro
und him his slow
ly uttered words
 were distinctl
y heard. “I th
ank you all for 
your hard and fa
ithful service. 
 The victory is 
complete and Rus
sia will not for
get you! Honor t
o you forever.�
��  He paused 
and looked aroun
d.  “Lower i
"ts head, lower i"
t!” he said to
 a soldier who h
ad accidentally 
 lowered the Fre

 holding before 
the Preobrazhén
sk standards. �
"��Lower, lower, "
that’s it. Hur
rah lads!” he 
"added, addressin"
g the men with 
a rapid movement
 of his chin.  
 “Hur-r-rah!�

ds of voices.  
 While the soldi

g Kutúzov leane
d forward in his
 saddle and bow
"ed his head, and"
 his eye lit up 
with a mild and 
apparently ironi
c gleam.  “
"You see, brother"
s...” said he 
when the shouts 
had ceased... an
d all at once h
is voice and the
 expression of h
is face changed.
 It was no longe

anted to tell h

as a stir among 
the throng of of

"�You see, brothe"

 He looked aroun

 fixed upon him
 he read sympath

 and brighter wi
th an old man’

And flourishing

      CHAPT
ER VII  When t
he troops reache
d their night’
s halting place 
on the eighth of
"
November, the "
last day of the 
Krásnoe battles
", it was already"
 growing dusk. 
All day it had b
een calm and fro
sty with occasio
nal lightly fal
ling snow and to
ward evening it 
began to clear. 
Through the fall
ing snow a purp
le-black and sta
rry sky showed i
tself and the fr
ost grew keener
.  An infantry
 regiment which 
had left Tarúti
no three thousan
d strong but no
w numbered only 
nine hundred was
 one of the firs
t to arrive that
 night at its h
alting place—a
 village on the 
highroad. The qu
artermasters who
 met the regime
nt announced tha
t all the huts w
ere full of sick
 and dead Frenc
"hmen, cavalrymen"
", and members of"
 the staff. Ther
e was only one h
ut available fo
r the regimental
 commander.  T
he commander rod
e up to his hut.
 The regiment pa
ssed through the
 village and st
acked its arms i
n front of the l
ast huts.  Lik
e some huge many
"-limbed animal, "
the regiment beg
an to prepare it
s lair and its 
food. One part o
f it dispersed a
nd waded knee-de
ep through the 
snow into a birc
h forest to the 
right of the vil
"lage, and
immed"
iately the sound
 of axes and swo
"rds, the crashin"
"g of branches,
"
and merry voices
 could be heard 
from there. Anot
her section amid
 the regimental
 wagons and hors
es which were st
anding in a grou
p was busy gett
ing out caldrons
 and rye biscuit
", and feeding th"
e horses. A thir
d section scatt
ered through the
 village arrangi
ng quarters for 
the staff offic
"ers, carrying ou"
t the French cor
pses that were i
"n the huts, and"
 dragging away b
"oards, dry wood,"
 and thatch from
" the roofs, for "
"the
campfires, "
or wattle fences
 to serve for sh
elter.  Some f
ifteen men with 
merry shouts wer
e shaking down t
he high wattle 
"wall of a shed, "
the roof of whic
h had already be
en removed.  �
"��Now then, all "
together—shove
!” cried the v
"oices, and the h"
uge surface of 
"the wall, sprink"
led with snow an
d creaking with 
"frost, was seen"
 swaying in the 
gloom of the nig
ht. The lower st
akes cracked mor
e and more and 
at last the wall
" fell, and with "
it the men who h
ad been pushing 
"
it. Loud, coars"
e laughter and j
oyous shouts ens
ued.  “Now t
"hen, catch hold "
in twos! Hand up
 the lever! That
’s it.... Wher
e are you shovi
ng to?”  “
"Now, all togethe"
r! But wait a mo
"ment, boys... Wi"
th a song!”  
 All stood silen
"t, and a soft, p"
leasant velvety 
voice began to s
ing. At the end
 of the third ve
rse as the last 
"note died away, "
twenty voices r
oared out at onc
e: “Oo-oo-oo-o
o! That’s it. 
All together! He
"ave away,
boys!"
...” but despi
te their united 
efforts the watt
"le hardly moved,"
 and in the sil
ence that follow
ed the heavy bre
athing of the me
n was audible. 
"
“Here, you o"
f the Sixth Comp
any! Devils that
 you are! Lend a
 hand... will y
ou? You may want
 us one of these
 days.”  Som
e twenty men of 
the Sixth Compan
y who were on th
eir way into the
 village joined
" the haulers, an"
d the wattle wal
"l, which was abo"
ut thirty-five 
feet long and se
"ven feet high, m"
oved forward alo
ng the village 
"street, swaying,"
 pressing upon a
nd cutting the s
houlders of the 
 gasping men.  
 “Get along...
 Falling? What a
re you stopping 
for? There now..
..”  Merry s
enseless words o
f abuse flowed f
reely.  “Wha
t are you up to?
” suddenly cam
e the authoritat
ive voice of a 
sergeant major w
ho came upon the
 men who were ha
uling their burd
en. “There ar
e gentry here; t
he general himse
lf is in that hu
"t, and you
foul"
"-mouthed devils,"
" you brutes, I�"
�ll give it to y
ou!” shouted h
"e,
hitting the "
first man who ca
me in his way a 
swinging blow on
 the back. “C
an’t you make 
less noise?” 
 The men became
 silent. The sol
dier who had bee
n struck groaned
 and wiped his 
"face, which had "
been scratched t
ill it bled by h
is falling again
st the wattle. 
"

“There, how"
 that devil hits
 out! He’s mad
e my face all bl
"oody,” said he"
 in a frightene
d whisper when t
he sergeant majo
r had passed on.
  “Don’t y
ou like it?” s
aid a laughing v
"oice, and modera"
ting their tones
 the men moved 
forward.  When
 they were out o
f the village th
ey began talking
 again as loud a
"s
before, inter"
larding their ta
lk with the same
 aimless expleti
ves.  In the h
ut which the men
" had passed, the"
 chief officers 
had gathered and
 were in animat
ed talk over the
ir tea about the
 events of the d
ay and the mane
uvers suggested 
for tomorrow. It
 was proposed to
 make a flank ma
rch to the left
", cut off the Vi"
ce-King (Murat) 
and capture him.
  By the time 
the soldiers had
 dragged the wat
tle fence to its
 place the camp
fires were blazi
ng on all sides 
ready for cookin
"g, the wood
cra"
"ckled, the snow "
"was melting, and"
 black shadows o
f soldiers flitt
ed to and fro a
ll over the occu
pied space where
 the snow had be
en trodden down
.  Axes and ch
oppers were plie
d all around. Ev
erything was don
e without any o
rders being give
n. Stores of woo
d were brought f
"or the night, sh"
elters were rig
ged up for the o
"fficers, caldron"
s were being boi
"led, and muskets"
 and accouterme
nts put in order
.  The wattle 
wall the men had
 brought was set
 up in a semicir
cle by the Eigh
th Company as a 
shelter from the
" north, propped "
up by musket res
"ts,
and a campf"
ire was built be
fore it. They be
"at the tattoo, c"
"alled the
roll,"
" had supper, and"
 settled down ro
und the fires fo
r the night—so
me repairing th
"eir footgear, so"
me smoking pipes
", and some strip"
ping themselves
 naked to steam 
the lice out of 
their shirts.  
     CHAPTER
 VIII  One wou
ld have thought 
that under the a
lmost incredibly
 wretched condi
tions the Russia
n soldiers were 
in at that time�
��lacking warm b
oots and sheeps
"kin coats, witho"
ut a roof over t
"heir heads, in t"
he snow with ei
ghteen degrees o
"f frost, and wit"
hout even full r
ations (the com
missariat did no
t always keep up
 with the troops
)—they would h
ave presented a
 very sad and de
pressing spectac
le.  On the co
"ntrary, the army"
 had never under
 the best materi
al conditions p
resented a more 
cheerful and ani
mated aspect. Th
is was because a
ll who began to
 grow depressed 
or who lost stre
ngth were sifted
 out of the army
 day by day. Al
l the physically
 or morally weak
 had long since 
been left behin
d and only the f
lower of the arm
y—physically a
nd mentally—re
mained.  More 
men collected be
hind the wattle 
fence of the Eig
hth Company than
 anywhere else.
 Two sergeants m
ajor were sittin
g with them and 
their campfire 
blazed brighter 
than others. For
 leave to sit by
 their wattle t
hey demanded con
tributions of fu
"el.

“Eh, Ma"
kéev! What has 
"become of you, y"
ou son of a bitc
h? Are you lost 
or have the wol
ves eaten you? F
etch some more w
ood!” shouted 
a red-haired an
"d red-faced man,"
 screwing up his
 eyes and blinki
ng because of th
e smoke but not
 moving back fro
m the fire. “A
"nd you, Jackdaw,"
 go and fetch s
ome wood!” sai
d he to another 
soldier.  This
 red-haired man 
was neither a se
rgeant nor a cor
"poral, but being"
 robust he orde
red about those 
weaker than hims
elf. The soldier
 they called �
"�Jackdaw,” a t"
hin little fello
w with a sharp n
"ose, rose
obedi"
ently and was ab
out to go but at
 that instant th
ere came into t
he light of the 
fire the slender
", handsome figur"
e of a young sol
dier carrying a
 load of wood. 
 “Bring it he
re—that’s fi
ne!”  They s
plit up the wood
", pressed it dow"
"n on the fire, b"
lew at it with 
"their mouths, an"
d fanned it with
 the skirts of t
"heir greatcoats,"
 making the fla
mes hiss and cra
ckle. The men dr
ew nearer and li
t their pipes. 
The handsome you
ng soldier who h
ad brought the w
"ood, setting his"
" arms
akimbo, b"
egan stamping hi
s cold feet rapi
dly and deftly o
n the spot wher
e he stood.  �
��Mother! The de
w is cold but cl
ear.... It’s w
ell that I’m a
 musketeer...�
"� he sang, prete"
nding to hiccoug
h after each syl
lable.  “Loo
"k out, your sole"
s will fly off!�
�� shouted the r
"ed-haired man,
"
noticing that th
e sole of the da
ncer’s boot wa
s hanging loose.
 “What a fell
ow you are for d
ancing!”  Th
e dancer stopped
", pulled off the"
 loose piece of 
"leather, and thr"
ew it on the fi
re.  “Right 
"enough, friend,�"
"�� said he, and,"
 having sat down
", took out of hi"
s knapsack a sc
rap of blue Fren
"ch cloth, and wr"
apped it round h
is foot. “It�
��s the steam th
"at spoils them,�"
"�� he added, str"
etching out his 
feet toward the
 fire.  “The
y’ll soon be i
ssuing us new on
es. They say tha
t when we’ve f
inished hammeri
"ng them, we’re"
 to receive doub
le kits!”  �
��And that son o
f a bitch Petró
v has lagged beh
"ind after all, i"
"t seems,”
sai"
d one sergeant m
ajor.  “I’
ve had an eye on
 him this long w
"hile,” said th"
e other.  “W
"ell, he’s a po"
or sort of soldi
er....”  “
But in the Third
 Company they sa
y nine men were 
missing yesterda
"y.”

“Yes,"
 it’s all very
" well, but when "
a man’s feet a
re frozen how ca
n he walk?” 
 “Eh? Don’t
 talk nonsense!�
�� said a sergea
nt major.  “
Do you want to b
e doing the same
?” said an old
" soldier, turnin"
g reproachfully
 to the man who 
had spoken of fr
ozen feet.  �
"�Well, you know,"
” said the sha
rp-nosed man the
y called Jackdaw
 in a squeaky a
nd unsteady voic
"e, raising himse"
lf at the other 
side of the fir
"e, “a plump ma"
"n gets thin, but"
 for a thin one 
it’s death. Ta
"ke
me, now! I�"
�ve got no stren
"gth left,” he "
"added, with sudd"
en resolution t
urning to the se
rgeant major. �
�Tell them to se
nd me to hospita
l; I’m aching
 all over; anywa
y I shan’t be 
able to keep up.
”  “That�
"�ll do, that’l"
l do!” replied
 the sergeant ma
jor quietly.  
The soldier said
 no more and the
 talk went on. 
 “What a lot 
of those Frenchi
es were taken to
"day, and the fac"
t is that not o
ne of them had w
hat you might ca
ll real boots on
",” said a sold"
"ier,
starting a"
 new theme. “T
hey were no more
 than make-belie
ves.”  “Th
e Cossacks have 
taken their boot
s. They were cle
aring the hut fo
r the colonel a
nd carried them 
out. It was piti
"ful to see them,"
" boys,” put in"
 the dancer. �
�As they turned 
them over one se
emed still alive
" and, would
you"
" believe it, he "
jabbered somethi
ng in their ling
o.”  “But 
they’re a clea
"n folk, lads,”"
 the first man w
ent on; “he wa
s white—as wh
ite as birchbark
—and some of t
hem are such fin
"e fellows, you
"
might think they
 were nobles.”
"

“Well, wha"
t do you think? 
They make soldie
rs of all classe
s there.”  �
��But they don�
�t understand ou
"r talk at all,�"
� said the dance
r with a puzzle
d smile. “I as
ked him whose su
"bject he was, an"
d he jabbered in
 his own way. A
 queer lot!” 
 “But it’s 
"strange, friends"
",” continued t"
he man who had w
ondered at their
"
whiteness, “"
the peasants at 
Mozháysk were s
aying that when 
they began bury
ing the dead—w
here the battle 
was you know—w
"ell, those dead "
had been lying 
there for nearly
" a month, and sa"
"ys the peasant, "
‘they lie as w
"hite
as paper, "
"clean, and not a"
s much smell as 
a puff of powder
 smoke.’”  
 “Was it from 
the cold?” ask
ed someone.  �
��You’re a cle
ver fellow! From
 the cold indeed
"! Why, it was ho"
t. If it had be
en from the cold
", ours would not"
 have rotted eit
"her. ‘But,’ "
"he
says, ‘go "
up to ours and t
hey are all rott
en and maggoty. 
"So,’ he says,"
 ‘we tie our f
aces up with ker
chiefs and turn 
our heads away a
s we drag them 
off: we can hard
ly do it. But th
"eirs,’ he says"
", ‘are white a"
s paper and not
 so much smell a
s a whiff of gun
powder.’”  
 All were silent
.  “It must 
be from their fo
"od,” said the "
sergeant major. 
“They used to 
 gobble the same
 food as the gen
try.”  No on
e contradicted h
im.  “That p
easant near Mozh
áysk where the 
battle was said 
the men were all
 called up from
 ten villages ar
ound and they ca
rted for twenty 
days and still 
didn’t finish 
carting the dead
 away. And as fo
"r the wolves, he"
 says...”  
“That was a re
"al battle,” sa"
id an old soldie
r. “It’s the
 only one worth 
 remembering; bu
t since that... 
it’s only been
 tormenting folk
.”  “And d
"o you know, Dadd"
"y, the day befor"
e yesterday we r
"an at them and,"
"
my word, they d"
idn’t let us g
et near before t
hey just threw d
own their muske
ts and went on t
heir knees. ‘P
ardon!’ they s
ay. That’s onl
y one case. The

ok ‘Poleon him

he didn’t know
 the right char
m. He catches hi
m and catches hi
m—no good! He 
turns into a bi
rd in his hands 
and flies away. 
And there’s no
 way of killing 
him either.” 
  “You’re a
 first-class lia
"r, Kiselëv, whe"
n I come to look
 at you!”  �
"��Liar, indeed! "
It’s the real 
truth.”  “
If he fell into 
"my hands, when I"
’d caught him 
I’d bury him i
n the ground wi
th an aspen stak
e to fix him dow
n. What a lot of
 men he’s rui
ned!”  “We
"ll, anyhow we’"
re going to end 
it. He won’t c
"ome here again,�"
�� remarked the
" old soldier, ya"
wning.  The co
nversation flagg
"ed, and the sold"
iers began settl
ing down to slee
p.  “Look at
 the stars. It�
�s wonderful how
 they shine! You
 would think the
 women had spre
ad out their lin
"en,” said one "
"of the men, gazi"
ng with admirat
ion at the Milky
 Way.  “That
’s a sign of a
 good harvest ne
xt year.”  �
��We shall want 
some more wood.�
��  “You war

your belly gets 
frozen. That’s
 queer.”  �
�O Lord!”  �
��What are you p
ushing for? Is t
he fire only for
 you? Look how h
e’s sprawling
!”  In the s
ilence that ensu
"ed, the snoring "
of those who had
 fallen asleep 
could be heard. 
Others turned ov
er and warmed th
"emselves, now an"
d again exchang
ing a few words.
 From a campfire
 a hundred paces
 off came a soun
"d
of general, m"
erry laughter. 
 “Hark at the
m roaring there 
in the Fifth Com
pany!” said on
e of the soldie
"rs, “and what "
a lot of them th
ere are!”  O
ne of the men go
t up and went ov
er to the Fifth 
Company.  “T
hey’re having 
"such fun,” sai"
"d he, coming bac"
k. “Two French
ies have turned
 up. One’s qui
te frozen and th
e other’s an a

He’s singing 
songs....”  
"“Oh, I’ll go"
 across and have
 a look....” 
 And several of
 the men went ov
er to the Fifth 
Company.    
  CHAPTER IX 
 The Fifth comp
any was bivouack
ing at the very 
edge of the fore
st. A huge camp
fire was blazing
 brightly in the
 midst of the sn
"ow, lighting up "
the branches of
 trees heavy wit
h hoarfrost.  
About midnight t
hey heard the so
und of steps in 
the snow of the 
"forest,
and the"
 crackling of dr
y branches.  �
"��A bear, lads,�"
�� said one of t
he men.  They 
all raised their
 heads to listen
", and out of the"
 forest into the
 bright firelig
ht stepped two s
trangely clad hu
man figures clin
ging to one ano
ther.  These w
ere two Frenchme
n who had been h
iding in the for
est. They came u
"p
to the fire, "
hoarsely utterin
g something in a
 language our so
ldiers did not 
understand. One 
was taller than 
the other; he wo
re an officer’
s hat and seeme
d quite exhauste
d. On approachin
g the fire he ha
d been going to 
"
sit down, but f"
"ell. The other, "
a short sturdy s
oldier with a sh
awl tied round 
"his head, was st"
ronger. He raise
d his companion 
and said someth
"ing, pointing to"
 his mouth. The 
soldiers surroun
ded the Frenchme
"n,
spread a gre"
atcoat on the gr
ound for the sic
"k man, and broug"
ht some buckwhe
at porridge and 
vodka for both o
f them.  The e
xhausted French 
officer was Ramb
alle and the man
 with his head 
wrapped in the s
"hawl was Morel, "
his orderly.  
When Morel had d
runk some vodka 
and finished his
 bowl of porridg
e he suddenly b
ecame unnaturall
y merry and chat
tered incessantl
y to the soldie
"rs, who could no"
t understand him
. Ramballe refus
ed food and res
ting his head on
 his elbow lay s
ilent beside the
" campfire, looki"
ng at the Russi
an soldiers with
 red and vacant 
eyes. Occasional
ly he emitted a
 long-drawn groa
n and then again
 became silent. 
"Morel, pointing "
to his shoulder
"s, tried to impr"
ess on the soldi
ers the fact tha
t Ramballe was 
an officer and o
ught to be warme
d. A Russian off
icer who had com
e up to the fir
e sent to ask hi
s colonel whethe
r he would not t
ake a French of
ficer into his h
"ut to warm him, "
and when the mes
senger returned 
and said that t
he colonel wishe
d the officer to
 be brought to h
"im, Ramballe
wa"
s told to go. He
 rose and tried 
"to walk, but sta"
ggered and would
 have fallen ha
d not a soldier 
standing by held
 him up.  “Y
ou won’t do it
" again, eh?” s"
aid one of the s
"oldiers, winking"
 and turning mo
ckingly to Ramba
"lle.

“Oh, y"
ou fool! Why tal
"k rubbish, lout "
that you are—a
 real peasant!�
� came rebukes 
from all sides a
ddressed to the 
jesting soldier.
  They surroun
"ded Ramballe, li"
fted him on the 
crossed arms of 
"two
soldiers, a"
nd carried him t
o the hut. Ramba
lle put his arms
 around their n
ecks while they 
carried him and 
began wailing pl
aintively:  �
"�Oh, you fine fe"
"llows, my kind, "
kind friends! Th
"ese are men! Oh,"
" my
brave, kind"
" friends,” and"
 he leaned his h
ead against the 
shoulder of one 
 of the men like
 a child.  Mea
nwhile Morel was
 sitting in the 
best place by th
"e fire, surround"
ed by the soldi
"ers.

Morel, a"
 short sturdy Fr
enchman with inf
lamed and stream
"ing eyes, was
w"
earing a woman�
�s cloak and had
 a shawl tied wo
man fashion roun
d his head over
 his cap. He was
 evidently tipsy
", and was singin"
g a French song 
 in a hoarse bro
"ken voice, with "
an arm thrown ro
und the nearest 
soldier. The so
ldiers simply he
ld their sides a
s they watched h
im.  “Now th
"en, now then, te"
ach us how it go
es! I’ll soon 
pick it up. How 
is it?” said 
the man—a sing
er and a wag—w
hom Morel was em
bracing.  “V

“Bravo! Ha, "

  CHAPTER X  
 The French army
 melted away at 
the uniform rate
 of a mathematic
al progression;
 and that crossi
ng of the Berëz
ina about which 
so much has bee
n written was on
ly one intermedi
ate stage in its
" destruction, an"
d not at all th
e decisive episo
de of the campai
gn. If so much h
as been and sti
ll is written ab
out the Berëzin
"a, on the French"
 side this is on
ly because at t
he broken bridge
 across that riv
er the calamitie
s their army ha
d been previousl
y enduring were 
suddenly concent
rated at one mom
ent into a trag
ic spectacle tha
t remained in ev
"ery memory, and "
on the Russian 
side merely beca
use in Petersbur
g—far from the
 seat of war—a
 plan (again on
e of Pfuel’s) 
had been devised
 to catch Napole
on in a strateg
ic trap at the B
erëzina River. 
Everyone assured
 himself that al
l would happen 
according to pla
"n, and therefore"
 insisted that i
t was just the 
crossing of the 
Berëzina that d
estroyed the Fre
nch army. In rea
lity the result
s of the crossin
g were much less
 disastrous to t
he French—in 
guns and men los
t—than Krásno
"e had been, as t"
he figures show.
  The sole imp
ortance of the c
rossing of the B
erëzina lies in
 the fact that 
it plainly and i
ndubitably prove
d the fallacy of
 all the plans f
or cutting off 
the enemy’s re
treat and the so
undness of the o
nly possible li
ne of action—t
he one Kutúzov 
and the general 
mass of the army
 demanded—nam
"ely, simply to f"
ollow the enemy 
up. The French c
rowd fled at a 
continually incr
easing speed and
 all its energy 
was directed to 
 reaching its go
al. It fled like
 a wounded anima
l and it was imp
ossible to bloc
k its path. This
 was shown not s
o much by the ar
rangements it m
ade for crossing
 as by what took
 place at the br
idges. When the 
bridges broke d
"own, unarmed sol"
"diers, people fr"
om Moscow and wo
men with childr
en who were with
 the French tran
"sport, all—car"
ried on by vis 
inertiæ—press
ed forward into 
boats and into t
he ice-covered w
ater and did no
t surrender.  
That impulse was
 reasonable. The
 condition of fu
gitives and of p
ursuers was equ
ally bad. As lon
g as they remain
ed with their ow
n people each m
ight hope for he
lp from his fell
ows and the defi
nite place he he
ld among them. 
But those who su
"rrendered, while"
 remaining in th
e same pitiful 
"plight, would be"
 on a lower leve
l to claim a sha
re in the neces
sities of life. 
The French did n
ot need to be in
formed of the fa
ct that half th
e prisoners—wi
th whom the Russ
ians did not kno
w what to do—
perished of cold
 and hunger desp
ite their captor
s’ desire to s
ave them; they 
felt that it cou
ld not be otherw
ise. The most co
mpassionate Rus
"sian commanders,"
 those favorable
 to the French�
�and even the Fr
enchmen in the 
Russian service�
��could do nothi
ng for the priso
ners. The French
 perished from 
the conditions t
o which the Russ
ian army was its
elf exposed. It
 was impossible 
to take bread an
d clothes from o
ur hungry and i
ndispensable sol
diers to give to
" the French who,"
 though not harm
"ful, or
hated, "
"or guilty, were "
simply unnecessa
ry. Some Russian
"s even did that,"
 but they were 
exceptions.  C
ertain destructi
on lay behind th
e French but in 
front there was 
hope. Their shi
ps had been burn
"ed, there was no"
 salvation save 
in collective f
"light, and on th"
at the whole str
ength of the Fre
nch was concentr
ated.  The far
ther they fled t
he more wretched
 became the plig
ht of the remna
"nt, especially a"
fter the Berëzi
"na, on which (in"
 consequence of 
the Petersburg 
plan) special ho
pes had been pla
ced by the Russi
"ans, and
the ke"
ener grew the pa
ssions of the Ru
ssian commanders
", who blamed one"
 another and Ku
túzov most of a
ll. Anticipation
 that the failur
e of the Peters
burg Berëzina p
lan would be att
ributed to Kutú
zov led to diss
"atisfaction, con"
"tempt, and ridic"
"ule, more and mo"
re strongly exp
ressed. The ridi
cule and contemp
t were of course
 expressed in a 
 respectful form
", making it impo"
ssible for him t
o ask wherein he
 was to blame. 
They did not tal
k seriously to h
im; when reporti
ng to him or as
king for his san
ction they appea
red to be fulfil
ling a regrettab
"le
formality, b"
ut they winked b
ehind his back a
nd tried to misl
ead him at ever
y turn.  Becau
se they could no
t understand him
 all these peopl
e assumed that 
it was useless t
o talk to the ol
d man; that he w
ould never grasp
 the profundity
" of their plans,"
 that he would a
nswer with his p
hrases (which t
hey thought were
 mere phrases) a
bout a “golden
" bridge,” abou"
t the impossibi
lity of crossing
 the frontier wi
th a crowd of ta
"tterdemalions,
"
and so forth. Th
ey had heard all
 that before. An
d all he said—
that it was nec
essary to await 
"provisions, or t"
hat the men had 
no boots—was s
"o
simple, while"
 what they propo
sed was so compl
icated and cleve
"r, that
it was "
evident that he 
was old and stup
id and that they
", though not in"
"
power, were com"
manders of geniu
s.  After the 
junction with th
e army of the br
illiant admiral 
and Petersburg 
hero Wittgenstei
"n, this mood and"
 the gossip of t
he staff reached
 their maximum.
 Kutúzov saw th
is and merely si
ghed and shrugge
d his shoulders.
"
Only once, aft"
er the affair of
" the Berëzina, "
did he get angry
 and write to B
ennigsen (who re
ported separatel
y to the Emperor
) the following 
 letter:  “O
n account of you
r spells of ill 
"health, will you"
r excellency ple
ase be so good 
as to set off fo
r Kalúga on rec
"eipt of this, an"
d there await f
urther commands 
and appointments
 from His Imperi
al Majesty.” 
 But after Benn
igsen’s depart
"ure, the Grand D"
uke Tsarévich C
onstantine Páv
lovich joined th
e army. He had t
aken part in the
 beginning of th
e campaign but 
had subsequently
 been removed fr
om the army by K
utúzov. Now ha
ving come to the
" army, he inform"
ed Kutúzov of t
he Emperor’s 
displeasure at t
he poor success 
of our forces an
d the slowness o
f their advance
. The Emperor in
tended to join t
he army personal
ly in a few days
’ time.  Th
"e old man, exper"
ienced in court 
as well as in mi
litary affairs�
�this same Kut�
�zov who in Augu
st had been chos
en commander in 
chief against t
he sovereign’s
 wishes and who 
had removed the 
Grand Duke and 
heir-apparent fr
om the army—wh
o on his own aut
hority and contr
ary to the Empe
ror’s will had
 decided on the 
abandonment of M
"oscow, now reali"
zed at once tha
t his day was ov
"er, that his par"
"t was played, an"
d that the power
 he was suppose
d to hold was no
 longer his. And
 he understood t
his not merely 
from the attitud
e of the court. 
He saw on the on
e hand that the 
 military busine
ss in which he h
ad played his pa
rt was ended and
 felt that his 
mission was acco
mplished; and at
 the same time h
e began to be c
onscious of the 
physical wearine
ss of his aged b
ody and of the 
necessity of phy
sical rest.  O
n the twenty-nin
th of November K
utúzov entered 
Vílna—his “
dear Vílna” 
as he called it.
 Twice during hi
s career Kutúzo
v had been gover
nor of Vílna. 
In that wealthy 
"town, which had "
not been injured
", he found old
"
friends and asso
"ciations, beside"
s the comforts o
f life of which 
he had so long 
been deprived. A
nd he suddenly t
urned from the c
ares of army an
"d state and, as "
far as the passi
ons that seethed
 around him allo
"wed,
immersed h"
imself in the qu
iet life to whic
h he had formerl
y been accustom
"ed, as if all th"
at was taking pl
ace and all that
 had still to be
 done in the re
alm of history d
id not concern h
im at all.  Ch
"ichagóv, one of"
 the most zealou
s “cutters-off
” and “break
"ers-up,” who
"
had first wanted
 to effect a div
ersion in Greece
 and then in War
saw but never w
ished to go wher
e he was sent: C
"hichagóv, noted"
 for the boldnes
s with which he
 spoke to the Em
"peror, and who c"
onsidered Kutúz
ov to be under 
an obligation to
 him because whe
n he was sent to
 make peace wit
h Turkey in 1811
 independently o
"f Kutúzov, and "
found that peace
 had already be
"en concluded, he"
 admitted to the
 Emperor that th
e merit of secu
ring that peace 
was really Kutú
zov’s; this Ch
ichagóv was the
 first to meet 
Kutúzov at the 
castle where the
 latter was to s
tay. In undress 
"
naval uniform, "
"with a dirk, and"
 holding his cap
" under his arm, "
he handed Kutú
zov a garrison r
eport and the ke
ys of the town. 
The contemptuous
ly respectful a
ttitude of the y
ounger men to th
e old man in his
 dotage was exp
ressed in the hi
ghest degree by 
the behavior of 
"Chichagóv, who "
knew of the acc
usations that we
re being directe
d against Kutúz
ov.  When spea
king to Chichag�
"�v, Kutúzov inc"
identally mentio
ned that the ve
hicles packed wi
th china that ha
d been captured 
from him at Bor�
�sov had been r
ecovered and wou
ld be restored t
o him.  “You
 mean to imply t
hat I have nothi
ng to eat out of
.... On the con
"trary, I can sup"
ply you with eve
rything even if 
you want to give
 dinner parties
",” warmly repl"
"ied Chichagóv, "
who tried by eve
ry word he spok
e to prove his o
wn rectitude and
 therefore imagi
ned Kutúzov to 
be animated by 
the same desire.
"

Kutúzov, sh"
rugging his shou
"lders, replied w"
ith his subtle p
enetrating smil
e: “I meant me
rely to say what
 I said.”  C
ontrary to the E
mperor’s wish 
Kutúzov detaine
d the greater pa
rt of the army 
at Vílna. Those
 about him said 
that he became e
xtraordinarily s
lack and physic
ally feeble duri
ng his stay in t
hat town. He att
ended to army a
ffairs reluctant
"ly, left everyth"
ing to his gener
"als, and while a"
waiting the Emp
eror’s arrival
 led a dissipate
d life.  Havin
g left Petersbur
g on the seventh
 of December wit
h his suite—Co
"unt
Tolstóy, P"
rince Volkónski
", Arakchéev, an"
d others—the E
mperor reached 
Vílna on the el
"eventh, and in h"
is traveling sle
igh drove straig
ht to the castl
e. In spite of t
he severe frost 
some hundred gen
erals and staff 
 officers in ful
l parade uniform
 stood in front 
"of the castle, a"
s well as a gua
rd of honor of t
he Semënov regi
ment.  A couri
er who galloped 
to the castle in
" advance, in a t"
royka with three
 foam-flecked h
"orses, shouted �"
��Coming!” and
 Konovnítsyn ru
shed into the v
estibule to info
"rm Kutúzov, who"
 was waiting in 
the hall porter�
��s little lodg
e.  A minute l
ater the old man
’s large stout
 figure in full-
"dress uniform,
"
his chest covere
d with orders an
d a scarf drawn 
round his stomac
"h,
waddled out "
into the porch. 
He put on his ha
t with its peaks
 to the sides a
"nd, holding his "
gloves in his ha
nd and walking w
ith an effort s
ideways down the
 steps to the le
vel of the stree
"t, took in his h"
and the report 
he had prepared 
for the Emperor.
  There was ru
nning to and fro
 and whispering;
 another troyka 
flew furiously 
"up, and then all"
 eyes were turne
d on an approach
ing sleigh in w
hich the figures
 of the Emperor 
and Volkónski c
ould already be 
 descried.  Fr
om the habit of 
fifty years all 
this had a physi
cally agitating 
effect on the o
ld general. He c
arefully and has
tily felt himsel
"f all over,
rea"
"djusted his hat,"
 and pulling him
self together dr
ew himself up an
"d,
at the very "
moment when the 
"Emperor, having "
alighted from th
"e sleigh,
lifte"
d his eyes to hi
"m, handed him th"
e report and beg
an speaking in h
"is
smooth, ingr"
atiating voice. 
  The Emperor w
ith a rapid glan
ce scanned Kutú
zov from head to
" foot,
frowned "
"for an instant, "
but immediately 
mastering himsel
f went up to the
"
old man, exten"
ded his arms and
 embraced him. A
nd this embrace 
"too, owing
to a"
 long-standing i
mpression relate
d to his innermo
"st feelings, had"
 its usual effe
ct on Kutúzov a
nd he gave a sob
.  The Emperor
 greeted the off
icers and the Se
"mënov guard, an"
d again pressin
g the old man’
s hand went with
 him into the ca
stle.  When al
one with the fie
ld marshal the E
mperor expressed
 his dissatisfa
ction at the slo
wness of the pur
suit and at the 
mistakes made a
t Krásnoe and t
"he Berëzina, an"
d informed him o
f his intentions
 for a future c
ampaign abroad. 
Kutúzov made no
 rejoinder or re
mark. The same 
"submissive, expr"
essionless look 
with which he ha
d listened to th
e Emperor’s c
ommands on the f
ield of Austerli
tz seven years b
efore settled o
n his face now. 
  When Kutúzov
 came out of the
 study and with 
lowered head was
 crossing the b
allroom with his
 heavy waddling 
"gait, he was arr"
ested by someone
’s voice sayi
ng:  “Your S
erene Highness!�
��  Kutúzov r
aised his head a
nd looked for a 
long while into 
the eyes of Cou
"nt Tolstóy, who"
 stood before hi
m holding a silv
er salver on whi
ch lay a small 
object. Kutúzov
 seemed not to u
nderstand what w
as expected of 
him.  Suddenly
 he seemed to re
member; a scarce
ly perceptible s
mile flashed ac
ross his puffy f
"ace, and bowing "
low and respectf
ully he took the
 object that la
y on the salver.
 It was the Orde
r of St. George 
of the First Cl
ass.      
CHAPTER XI  Ne
xt day the field
 marshal gave a 
dinner and ball 
which the Empero
r honored by hi
s presence. Kut�
�zov had receive
d the Order of S
t. George of th
e First Class an
d the Emperor sh
owed him the hig
"hest honors, but"
 everyone knew 
of the imperial 
dissatisfaction 
with him. The pr
oprieties were 
observed and the
 Emperor was the
 first to set th
"at example,
but"
 everybody under
stood that the o
ld man was blame
worthy and good
-for-nothing. Wh
"en Kutúzov, con"
forming to a cus
tom of Catherine
"’s
day, order"
ed the standards
 that had been c
aptured to be lo
wered at the Em
peror’s feet o
n his entering t
"he ballroom, the"
 Emperor made a 
wry face and mu
ttered something
 in which some p
eople caught the
" words, “the o"
ld comedian.”
  The Emperor�
��s displeasure 
with Kutúzov wa
s specially incr
eased at Vílna 
 by the fact tha
t Kutúzov evide
ntly could not o
r would not unde
rstand the impo
rtance of the co
ming campaign. 
 When on the fo
llowing morning 
the Emperor said
 to the officers
 assembled abou
t him: “You ha
ve not only save
"d Russia, you ha"
ve saved Europe!
” they all un
derstood that th
e war was not en
ded.  Kutúzov
 alone would not
 see this and op
enly expressed h
is opinion that 
 no fresh war co
uld improve the 
position or add 
to the glory of 
"Russia,
but cou"
ld only spoil an
d lower the glor
ious position th
at Russia had g
ained. He tried 
to prove to the 
Emperor the impo
ssibility of lev
ying fresh troo
"ps, spoke of the"
 hardships alrea
dy endured by th
"e people, of
th"
e possibility of
 failure and so 
forth.  This b
eing the field m
arshal’s frame
 of mind he was 
naturally regard
ed as merely a 
hindrance and ob
stacle to the im
pending war.  
To avoid unpleas
ant encounters w
"ith the old man,"
 the natural met
hod was to do w
hat had been don
e with him at Au
sterlitz and wit
h Barclay at th
e beginning of t
he Russian campa
ign—to transfe
r the authority 
to the Emperor 
"himself, thus cu"
tting the ground
 from under the 
commander in ch
ief’s feet wit
hout upsetting t
he old man by in
forming him of t
he change.  W
ith this object 
his staff was gr
adually reconstr
ucted and its re
al strength rem
oved and transfe
rred to the Empe
"ror. Toll, Konov"
"nítsyn, and
Er"
mólov received 
fresh appointmen
ts. Everyone spo
ke loudly of the
 field marshal�
��s great weakne
ss and failing h
ealth.  His he
alth had to be b
ad for his place
 to be taken awa
y and given to 
another. And in 
fact his health 
was poor.  So 
"naturally, simpl"
"y, and gradually"
—just as he ha
d come from Turk
ey to the Treas
ury in Petersbur
g to recruit the
" militia, and th"
en to the army 
when he was need
ed there—now w
hen his part was
" played out, Kut"
úzov’s place
 was taken by a 
new and necessar
y performer.  
"The war of 1812,"
 besides its nat
ional significan
ce dear to every
" Russian
heart,"
 was now to assu
"me another, a Eu"
"ropean, signific"
ance.  The mov
ement of peoples
 from west to ea
st was to be suc
ceeded by a mov
ement of peoples
 from east to we
"st, and for this"
 fresh war anoth
er leader was n
"ecessary, having"
 qualities and v
iews differing f
rom Kutúzov’
s and animated b
y different moti
ves.  Alexande
r I was as neces
sary for the mov
ement of the peo
ples from east 
to west and for 
the refixing of 
national frontie
rs as Kutúzov h
ad been for the
 salvation and g
lory of Russia. 
  Kutúzov did 
not understand w
"hat Europe, the "
balance of power
", or
Napoleon m"
eant. He could n
ot understand it
. For the repres
entative of the
" Russian people,"
 after the enemy
 had been destro
yed and Russia h
ad been liberat
ed and raised to
 the summit of h
"er glory, there "
was nothing lef
t to do as a Rus
sian. Nothing re
mained for the r
epresentative of
 the national w
"ar but to die, a"
nd Kutúzov died
.      CHA
PTER XII  As g
enerally happens
", Pierre did not"
 feel the full e
ffects of the p
hysical privatio
n and strain he 
had suffered as 
prisoner until a
fter they were 
over. After his 
liberation he re
"ached Orël, and"
 on the third d
"ay there, when p"
reparing to go t
"o Kiev, he fell "
ill and was laid
 up for three m
onths. He had wh
at the doctors t
ermed “bilious
 fever.” But 
despite the fact
 that the doctor
"s treated him, b"
"led him, and gav"
e him medicines
" to drink, he re"
covered.  Scar
cely any impress
ion was left on 
Pierre’s mind 
by all that happ
ened to him fro
m the time of hi
s rescue till hi
s illness. He re
membered only t
he dull gray wea
ther now rainy a
"nd now snowy, in"
ternal physical 
"
distress, and p"
ains in his feet
 and side. He re
membered a gener
al impression o
f the misfortune
s and sufferings
 of people and o
f being worried
 by the curiosit
y of officers an
d generals who q
"uestioned him, h"
e also remember
ed his difficult
y in procuring a
 conveyance and 
"horses, and
abo"
ve all he rememb
ered his incapac
ity to think and
 feel all that t
ime. On the day
 of his rescue h
e had seen the b
ody of Pétya Ro
stóv. That same
 day he had lea
rned that Prince
" Andrew, after s"
urviving the bat
tle of Borodin�
� for more than 
a month had rece
ntly died in the
 Rostóvs’ hou
se at Yarosláv
"l, and Denísov "
who told him thi
s news also ment
ioned Hélène�
"�s
death, suppo"
sing that Pierre
 had heard of it
 long before. Al
l this at the t
ime seemed merel
y strange to Pie
rre: he felt he 
could not grasp 
its significanc
e. Just then he 
was only anxious
 to get away as 
quickly as poss
ible from places
 where people we
re killing one a
"nother, to some"
 peaceful refuge
 where he could 
"recover himself,"
" rest, and think"
 over all the s
trange new facts
 he had learned;
 but on reaching
 Orël he immed
iately fell ill.
 When he came to
 himself after h
is illness he sa
w in attendance
 on him two of h
"is servants, Ter"
énty and Váska
", who had
come "
from Moscow; and
 also his cousin
 the eldest prin
"cess, who had be"
en living on hi
s estate at Elé
ts and hearing o
f his rescue and
 illness had co
me to look after
 him.  It was 
only gradually d
uring his conval
escence that Pie
rre lost the im
pressions he had
 become accustom
ed to during the
 last few months
 and got used t
o the idea that 
no one would obl
ige him to go an
ywhere tomorrow
", that no one wo"
uld deprive him 
"of his warm bed,"
 and that he wo
uld be sure to g
"et his dinner, t"
"ea, and supper. "
But for a long t
ime in his drea
ms he still saw 
himself in the c
onditions of cap
tivity. In the 
same way little 
by little he cam
e to understand 
the news he had 
been told after
" his rescue, abo"
ut the death of 
"Prince Andrew, t"
he death of his
" wife, and the d"
estruction of th
e French.  A j
oyous feeling of
 freedom—that 
complete inalien
able freedom nat
ural to man whi
ch he had first 
experienced at t
he first halt ou
tside Moscow—
filled Pierre’
s soul during hi
s convalescence.
 He was surprise
d to find that 
this inner freed
"om, which was in"
dependent of ext
ernal condition
"s, now had as it"
 were an additio
nal setting of e
xternal liberty
. He was alone i
n a strange town
", without acquai"
ntances. No one 
 demanded anythi
ng of him or sen
t him anywhere. 
He had all he wa
nted: the thoug
ht of his wife w
hich had been a 
continual tormen
t to him was no 
"
longer there, s"
ince she was no 
"more.

“Oh, "
how good! How sp
lendid!” said 
he to himself wh
en a cleanly lai
d table was mov
ed up to him wit
h savory beef te
"a, or when he la"
y down for the 
night on a soft 
"clean bed, or wh"
en he remembered
 that the French
 had gone and t
hat his wife was
" no more. “Oh,"
" how good, how s"
plendid!”  A
nd by old habit 
he asked himself
 the question: �
"��Well, and what"
 then? What am 
I going to do?�
� And he immedia
tely gave himsel
f the answer: �
"��Well, I shall "
"live. Ah, how sp"
lendid!”  Th
e very question 
that had formerl
"y tormented him,"
 the thing he ha
d continually s
ought to find—
the aim of life�
��no longer exis
ted for him now
. That search fo
r the aim of lif
e had not merely
 disappeared te
mporarily—he f
elt that it no l
onger existed fo
r him and could 
not present its
elf again. And t
his very absence
 of an aim gave 
him the complet
"e, joyous sense "
of freedom which
 constituted his
 happiness at t
his time.  He 
could not see an
" aim, for he now"
 had faith—not
 faith in any ki
"nd of
rule, or "
"words, or ideas,"
 but faith in an
" ever-living, ev"
er-manifest God
. Formerly he ha
d sought Him in 
aims he set hims
elf. That search
 for an aim had
 been simply a s
"earch for God, a"
nd suddenly in h
is captivity he
 had learned not
 by words or rea
soning but by di
rect feeling wha
t his nurse had
 told him long a
go: that God is 
here and everywh
ere. In his cap
tivity he had le
arned that in Ka
ratáev God was 
"greater, more in"
finite and unfa
thomable than in
 the Architect o
f the Universe r
ecognized by the
 Freemasons. He
 felt like a man
 who after strai
ning his eyes to
 see into the f
ar distance find
s what he sought
 at his very fee
t. All his life 
 he had looked o
ver the heads of
 the men around 
"him, when he sho"
uld have merely
 looked in front
 of him without 
straining his ey
es.  In the pa
st he had never 
been able to fin
d that great ins
crutable infini
te something. He
 had only felt t
hat it must exis
t somewhere and 
 had looked for 
it. In everythin
g near and compr
ehensible he had
 seen only what
" was limited, pe"
"tty, commonplace"
", and senseless."
 He had equippe
d himself with a
 mental telescop
e and looked int
"o remote space,"
 where petty wor
ldliness hiding 
itself in misty 
distance had see
med to him grea
t and infinite m
erely because it
 was not clearly
 seen. And such 
 had European li
"fe, politics, Fr"
"eemasonry, philo"
"sophy, and phila"
nthropy seemed 
to him. But even
" then, at moment"
s of weakness as
 he had accounte
"d
them, his min"
d had penetrated
 to those distan
ces and he had t
here seen the s
"ame pettiness, w"
"orldliness, and "
senselessness. N
"ow, however, he"
 had learned to 
"see the great, e"
"ternal, and infi"
nite in everythi
"ng, and
therefo"
re—to see it a
nd enjoy its con
templation—he 
naturally threw 
away the telesc
ope through whic
h he had till no
w gazed over men
"’s heads, and"
 gladly regarded
 the ever-changi
"ng, eternally gr"
"eat, unfathomabl"
"e, and
infinite"
 life around him
. And the closer
 he looked the m
ore tranquil and
 happy he becam
e. That dreadful
" question, “Wh"
at for?” which
 had formerly d
estroyed all his
 mental edifices
", no longer exis"
ted for him. To 
"that
question, "
“What for?” 
a simple answer 
was now always r
eady in his soul
: “Because th
"ere is a God, th"
at God without w
hose will not on
e hair falls fr
om a man’s hea
d.”      
 CHAPTER XIII  
 In external way
s Pierre had har
dly changed at a
ll. In appearanc
e he was just w
hat he used to b
e. As before he 
was absent-minde
d and seemed oc
cupied not with 
what was before 
his eyes but wit
h something spec
ial of his own.
 The difference 
between his form
er and present s
elf was that fo
rmerly when he d
id not grasp wha
t lay before him
 or was said to 
"
him, he had puc"
kered his forehe
ad painfully as 
if vainly seekin
g to distinguis
h something at a
 distance. At pr
esent he still f
orgot what was 
said to him and 
still did not se
e what was befor
"e his eyes, but "
he now looked w
ith a scarcely p
erceptible and s
eemingly ironic 
smile at what w
as before him an
d listened to wh
"at was said, tho"
ugh evidently se
eing and hearin
g something quit
e different. For
merly he had app
eared to be a k
indhearted but u
"nhappy man, and "
so people had be
en inclined to a
void him. Now a
 smile at the jo
y of life always
 played round hi
"s lips, and
sym"
pathy for others
 shone in his ey
es with a questi
oning look as to
 whether they w
ere as contented
" as he was, and "
people felt plea
sed by his pres
ence.  Previou
sly he had talke
"d a great deal, "
grew excited whe
"n he talked, and"
 seldom listene
d; now he was se
ldom carried awa
y in conversatio
n and knew how 
to listen so tha
t people readily
 told him their 
most intimate s
ecrets.  The p
"rincess, who had"
 never liked Pie
rre and had been
 particularly h
ostile to him si
nce she had felt
 herself under o
bligations to hi
m after the old
 count’s death
", now after stay"
ing a short time
 in Orël—wher
e she had come 
intending to sho
w Pierre that in
 spite of his in
gratitude she c
onsidered it her
 duty to nurse h
im—felt to her
 surprise and ve
xation that she
 had become fond
 of him. Pierre 
did not in any w
ay seek her app
"roval, he merely"
 studied her wit
h interest. Form
erly she had fel
t that he regar
ded her with ind
ifference and ir
"ony, and so had "
shrunk into her
self as she did 
with others and 
had shown him on
ly the combative
 side of her na
ture; but now he
 seemed to be tr
ying to understa
nd the most int
imate places of 
"her heart, and, "
mistrustfully at
 first but after
wards gratefull
"y, she let him s"
"ee the hidden, k"
indly sides of h
er character.  
 The most cunnin
g man could not 
have crept into 
her confidence m
ore successfull
"y, evoking memor"
ies of the best 
times of her you
th and showing 
sympathy with th
em. Yet Pierre�
�s cunning consi
sted simply in 
finding pleasure
 in drawing out 
the human qualit
ies of the embit
"tered,
hard, an"
d (in her own wa
y) proud princes
"s.

“Yes, he"
" is a very, very"
 kind man when h
e is not under t
he influence of 
 bad people but 
of people such a
"s myself,” tho"
ught she.  His
 servants too—
Terénty and Vá
ska—in their o
wn way noticed t
he change that 
had taken place 
in Pierre. They 
considered that 
he had become mu
ch “simpler.�
"�� Terénty, whe"
n he had helped 
him undress and 
wished him good 
"
night, often li"
ngered with his 
master’s boots
 in his hands an
d clothes over 
"his arm, to see "
whether he would
 not start a tal
"k. And Pierre,
"
noticing that Te
rénty wanted a 
"chat, generally "
kept him there. 
"

“Well, tell"
" me... now, how "
did you get food
?” he would as
k.  And Terén
ty would begin t
alking of the de
struction of Mos
"cow, and of
the"
" old count, and "
would stand for 
a long time hold
ing the clothes 
"and
talking, or"
 sometimes liste
ning to Pierre�
"�s stories, and "
then would go o
ut into the hall
 with a pleasant
 sense of intima
cy with his mast
er and affectio
n for him.  Th
e doctor who att
ended Pierre and
 visited him eve
"ry day, though h"
e considered it
 his duty as a d
octor to pose as
 a man whose eve
ry moment was o
f value to suffe
"ring humanity, w"
ould sit for hou
rs with Pierre 
telling him his 
favorite anecdot
es and his obser
vations on the 
characters of hi
s patients in ge
"neral, and espec"
ially of the lad
ies.  “It’
s a pleasure to 
talk to a man li
ke that; he is n
ot like our pro
"vincials,” he "
would say.  Th
ere were several
 prisoners from 
the French army 
"in Orël, and th"
e doctor brough
"t one of them, a"
" young Italian, "
to see Pierre. 
 This officer b
egan visiting Pi
"erre, and the pr"
incess used to m
ake fun of the 
tenderness the I
talian expressed
 for him.  The
 Italian seemed 
happy only when 
he could come to
" see Pierre, tal"
"k
with him, tel"
l him about his 
"past, his life a"
"t home, and his "
"love,
and pour "
out to him his i
ndignation again
st the French an
d especially ag
ainst Napoleon. 
  “If all Rus
sians are in the
" least like you,"
 it is sacrilege
 to fight such 
"a nation,” he "
said to Pierre. 
"“You, who have"
 suffered so fro
"m the
French, d"
o not even feel 
animosity toward
 them.”  Pie
rre had evoked t
he passionate af
fection of the I
talian merely by
 evoking the be
st side of his n
ature and taking
 a pleasure in s
o doing.  Duri
ng the last days
 of Pierre’s s
tay in Orël his
 old Masonic ac
quaintance Count
" Willarski, who "
had introduced h
im to the lodge 
"in
1807, came t"
o see him. Willa
rski was married
 to a Russian he
iress who had a
 large estate in
" Orël province,"
 and he occupied
 a temporary pos
t in the commis
sariat departmen
t in that town. 
  Hearing that 
Bezúkhov was in
" Orël, Willarsk"
"i, though they h"
ad never been i
"ntimate, came to"
 him with the pr
ofessions of fri
endship and inti
macy that peopl
e who meet in a 
desert generally
 express for one
 another. Willa
rski felt dull i
n Orël and was 
pleased to meet 
a man of his own
"
circle and, as"
" he supposed, of"
 similar interes
ts.  But to hi
s surprise Willa
rski soon notice
d that Pierre ha
d lagged much b
"ehind the times,"
" and had sunk, a"
s he expressed i
"t to himself, in"
to apathy and e
gotism.  “Yo
u are letting yo
"urself go, my de"
"ar fellow,” he"
 said.  But fo
r all that Willa
rski found it pl
easanter now tha
n it had been f
ormerly to be wi
"th Pierre, and c"
ame to see him e
very day. To Pie
rre as he looke
d at and listene
"d to Willarski, "
it seemed strang
e to think that 
 he had been lik
e that himself b
ut a short time 
before.  Willa
rski was a marri
ed man with a fa
"mily, busy with "
his family affai
"rs,
his wife’"
"s affairs, and h"
is official duti
es. He regarded 
all these occup
ations as hindra
"nces to life, an"
d considered tha
t they were all 
 contemptible be
cause their aim 
was the welfare 
of himself and h
is family. Mili
"tary, administra"
"tive, political,"
 and Masonic int
erests continua
lly absorbed his
 attention. And 
"Pierre, without "
trying to chang
e the other’s 
views and withou
t condemning him
", but with the q"
"uiet,
joyful, a"
nd amused smile 
now habitual to 
"him, was interes"
ted in this str
ange though very
 familiar phenom
enon.  There w
as a new feature
 in Pierre’s r
elations with Wi
"llarski, with th"
"e
princess, wit"
"h the doctor, an"
d with all the p
eople he now met
", which
gained "
for him the gene
ral good will. T
his was his ackn
owledgment of t
he impossibility
 of changing a m
an’s convictio
"ns by words, and"
 his recognitio
n of the possibi
lity of everyone
" thinking, feeli"
"ng, and seeing
"
things each from
 his own point o
f view. This leg
itimate peculiar
ity of each ind
ividual which us
ed to excite and
 irritate Pierre
 now became a b
asis of the symp
athy he felt for
", and the intere"
"st he took in, o"
ther people. Th
"e difference, an"
d sometimes comp
lete contradicti
"on, between
men"
’s opinions an
"d their lives, a"
nd between one m
"an and another, "
pleased him and
 drew from him a
n amused and gen
tle smile.  In
 practical matte
rs Pierre unexpe
ctedly felt with
in himself a cen
ter of gravity 
he had previousl
y lacked. Former
ly all pecuniary
" questions,
esp"
ecially requests
 for money to wh
"ich, as an extre"
mely wealthy man
",
he was very e"
"xposed, produced"
 in him a state 
of hopeless agit
ation and perpl
exity. “To giv
e or not to give
?” he had aske
d himself. “I 
have it and he 
needs it. But so
meone else needs
 it still more. 
Who needs it mo
st? And perhaps 
they are both im
postors?” In t
he old days he h
ad been unable 
to find a way ou
t of all these s
urmises and had 
given to all wh
o asked as long 
as he had anythi
ng to give. Form
erly he had been
 in a similar s
tate of perplexi
ty with regard t
o every question
 concerning his 
"
property, when "
one person advis
ed one thing and
 another somethi
ng else.  Now 
to his surprise 
he found that he
 no longer felt 
either doubt or 
 perplexity abou
t these question
s. There was now
 within him a ju
dge who by some
 rule unknown to
 him decided wha
t should or shou
ld not be done. 
  He was as ind
ifferent as here
tofore to money 
"matters, but now"
 he felt certai
n of what ought 
and what ought n
ot to be done. T
he first time he
 had recourse t
o his new judge 
was when a Frenc
"h prisoner, a co"
"lonel,
came to "
"him and, after t"
alking a great d
eal about his ex
"ploits,
conclud"
ed by making wha
t amounted to a 
demand that Pier
re should give 
him four thousan
d francs to send
 to his wife and
 children. Pierr
e refused witho
ut the least dif
ficulty or effor
"t, and was after"
wards surprised
 how simple and 
easy had been wh
at used to appea
r so insurmount
ably difficult. 
At the same time
 that he refused
 the colonel’s
 demand he made
 up his mind tha
t he must have r
ecourse to artif
ice when leavin
"g Orël, to indu"
ce the Italian o
fficer to accept
 some money of 
which he was evi
dently in need. 
A further proof 
to Pierre of his
 own more settl
ed outlook on pr
actical matters 
was furnished by
 his decision w
ith regard to hi
s wife’s debts
 and to the rebu
ilding of his ho
uses in and nea
r Moscow.  His
 head steward ca
me to him at Or�
�l and Pierre re
ckoned up with h
im his diminish
ed income. The b
urning of Moscow
" had cost him, a"
ccording to the 
 head steward’
"s calculation, a"
bout two million
 rubles.  To c
onsole Pierre fo
r these losses t
he head steward 
gave him an esti
mate showing th
at despite these
 losses his inco
me would not be 
diminished but 
would even be in
creased if he re
fused to pay his
 wife’s debts 
which he was un
der no obligatio
"n to meet, and d"
id not rebuild h
is Moscow house 
 and the country
 house on his Mo
"scow estate, whi"
ch had cost him 
eighty thousand
 rubles a year a
nd brought in no
thing.  “Yes
", of course that"
"’s true,” sa"
id Pierre with a
 cheerful smile.
 “I don’t n
eed all that at 
all. By being ru
ined I have beco
me much richer.�
��  But in Jan
uary Savélich c
ame from Moscow 
and gave him an 
account of the 
state of things 
"there, and spoke"
 of the estimate
 an architect ha
d made of the c
ost of rebuildin
g the town and c
"ountry houses, s"
peaking of this 
 as of a settled
 matter. About t
he same time he 
received letters
 from Prince Va
síli and other 
Petersburg acqua
intances speakin
g of his wife’
s debts. And Pi
erre decided tha
t the steward’
s proposals whic
h had so please
d him were wrong
 and that he mus
t go to Petersbu
rg and settle hi
s wife’s affa
irs and must reb
uild in Moscow. 
Why this was nec
essary he did n
"ot know, but he "
knew for certain
 that it was nec
essary. His inco
me would be red
uced by three fo
"urths, but he fe"
lt it must be do
ne.  Willarski
 was going to Mo
scow and they ag
reed to travel t
ogether.  Duri
ng the whole tim
e of his convale
scence in Orël 
Pierre had expe
rienced a feelin
"g of joy, freedo"
"m, and life; but"
 when during his
 journey he fou
nd himself in th
e open world and
 saw hundreds of
" new
faces, tha"
t feeling was in
tensified. Throu
ghout his journe
y he felt like 
a schoolboy on h
oliday. Everyone
—the stagecoac
"h driver, the po"
st-house overse
"ers, the peasant"
s on the roads a
nd in the villag
es—had a new 
significance for
 him. The presen
ce and remarks o
f Willarski who 
 continually dep
lored the ignora
nce and poverty 
of Russia and it
s backwardness 
compared with Eu
rope only height
ened Pierre’s 
pleasure. Where
 Willarski saw d
eadness Pierre s
aw an extraordin
ary strength and
 vitality—the
 strength which 
in that vast spa
ce amid the snow
s maintained th
e life of this o
"riginal, peculia"
"r, and unique pe"
ople. He did not
 contradict Wil
larski and even 
seemed to agree 
with him—an ap
parent agreemen
t being the simp
lest way to avoi
d discussions th
at could lead to
 nothing—and 
he smiled joyful
ly as he listene
d to him.    
   CHAPTER XIV
  It would be 
difficult to exp
lain why and whi
ther ants whose 
heap has been d
estroyed are hur
rying: some from
 the heap draggi
ng bits of rubb
"ish, larvae, and"
" corpses, others"
 back to the hea
"p, or why they
"
"jostle, overtake"
" one another, an"
"d fight, and it "
would be equally
 difficult to e
xplain what caus
ed the Russians 
after the depart
ure of the Fren
ch to throng to 
the place that h
ad formerly been
 Moscow. But whe
n we watch the 
ants round their
" ruined heap, th"
"e tenacity, ener"
"gy, and
immense"
 number of the d
elving insects p
rove that despit
e the destructio
"n
of the heap, "
something indest
"ructible, which "
though intangibl
e is the real s
trength of the c
"olony, still exi"
sts; and similar
"ly, though in
M"
oscow in the mon
th of October th
ere was no gover
nment and no chu
"rches,
shrines,"
" riches, or hous"
es—it was stil
l the Moscow it 
had been in Aug
ust. All was des
"troyed, except s"
omething intangi
ble yet powerful
 and indestruct
ible.  The mot
ives of those wh
o thronged from 
all sides to Mos
cow after it had
 been cleared o
f the enemy were
 most diverse an
"d personal, and "
at first for th
e most part sava
ge and brutal. O
ne motive only t
hey all had in 
common: a desire
 to get to the p
lace that had be
en called Moscow
", to
apply thei"
r activities the
re.  Within a 
week Moscow alre
ady had fifteen 
thousand inhabit
"ants, in a
fort"
night twenty-fiv
"e thousand, and "
so on. By the au
tumn of 1813 the
"
number, ever i"
ncreasing and in
"creasing, exceed"
ed what it had b
een in 1812.  
 The first Russi
ans to enter Mos
cow were the Cos
sacks of Wintzin
gerode’s deta
"chment, peasants"
 from the adjace
"nt villages, and"
 residents who h
ad fled from Mo
scow and had bee
n hiding in its 
vicinity. The Ru
ssians who ente
"red Moscow, find"
ing it plundered
", plundered it i"
n their turn. Th
ey continued wh
at the French ha
d begun. Trains 
of peasant carts
 came to Moscow
 to carry off to
 the villages wh
at had been aban
doned in the ru
ined houses and 
the streets. The
 Cossacks carrie
d off what they 
could to their 
"camps, and the h"
ouseholders seiz
ed all they coul
d find in other 
 houses and move
d it to their ow
"n, pretending th"
at it was their 
property.  But
 the first plund
erers were follo
wed by a second 
and a third con
"tingent, and wit"
h increasing num
bers plundering 
became more and 
more difficult 
and assumed more
 definite forms.
  The French f
ound Moscow aban
doned but with a
ll the organizat
ions of regular
" life, with dive"
rse branches of 
commerce and cra
"ftsmanship, with"
"
luxury, and go"
vernmental and r
eligious institu
tions. These for
ms were lifeles
s but still exis
ted. There were 
"bazaars, shops, "
"warehouses,
mar"
"ket stalls, gran"
aries—for the 
most part still 
stocked with goo
ds—and there 
were factories a
"nd workshops, pa"
laces and wealth
y houses filled 
"
with luxuries, "
"hospitals, priso"
"ns, government o"
"ffices, churches"
", and
cathedral"
s. The longer th
e French remaine
d the more these
 forms of town 
"life perished, u"
ntil finally all
 was merged into
" one confused, l"
ifeless scene o
f plunder.  Th
e more the plund
ering by the Fre
"nch continued, t"
he more both the
 wealth of Mosc
ow and the stren
gth of its plund
erers was destro
yed. But plunde

      CHAPT
ER XV  At the 
end of January P
ierre went to Mo
scow and stayed 
in an annex of 
his house which 
had not been bur
ned. He called o
n Count Rostopch
ín and on some
 acquaintances w
ho were back in 
"Moscow, and he i"
ntended to leave
 for Petersburg
 two days later.
 Everybody was c
elebrating the v
"ictory,
everyth"
ing was bubbling
 with life in th
e ruined but rev
iving city. Eve
ryone was please
"d to see Pierre,"
 everyone wished
" to meet him, an"
d everyone ques
tioned him about
 what he had see
n. Pierre felt p
articularly wel
l disposed towar
"d them all, but "
was now instinct
ively on his gu
ard for fear of 
binding himself 
in any way. To a
ll questions put
 to him—wheth
er important or 
quite trifling�
�such as: Where 
would he live? 
Was he going to 
rebuild? When wa
s he going to Pe
tersburg and wou
ld he mind taki
ng a parcel for 
someone?—he re
"plied: “Yes, p"
"erhaps,” or, �"
"��I
think so,�"
� and so on.  
He had heard tha
t the Rostóvs w
ere at Kostromá
 but the thought
 of Natásha se
ldom occurred to
 him. If it did 
it was only as a
 pleasant memor
y of the distant
 past. He felt h
imself not only 
free from social
 obligations bu
t also from that
" feeling which, "
it seemed to him
", he had
arouse"
d in himself.  
 On the third da
y after his arri
val he heard fro
m the Drubetskó
ys that Princes
s Mary was in Mo
"scow. The death,"
" sufferings, and"
 last days of P
rince Andrew had
 often occupied 
Pierre’s thoug
hts and now recu
rred to him wit
h fresh vividnes
s. Having heard 
at dinner that P
rincess Mary wa
s in Moscow and 
living in her ho
use—which had 
not been burned�
��in Vozdvízhe
"nka Street, he d"
rove that same e
vening to see he
r.  On his way
 to the house Pi
erre kept thinki
ng of Prince And
"rew, of their
f"
"riendship, of hi"
s various meetin
"gs with him, and"
 especially of t
he last one at 
Borodinó.  �
�Is it possible 
that he died in 
the bitter frame
 of mind he was 
then in? Is it 
possible that th
e meaning of lif
e was not disclo
sed to him befo
re he died?” t
hought Pierre. H
e recalled Karat
áev and his dea
th and involunt
arily began to c
ompare these two
" men, so differe"
"nt, and yet so
"
similar in that 
they had both li
ved and both die
d and in the lov
e he felt for b
oth of them.  
Pierre drove up 
to the house of 
the old prince i
n a most serious
 mood. The hous
e had escaped th
e fire; it showe
d signs of damag
e but its gener
al aspect was un
changed. The old
" footman, who me"
t Pierre with a 
 stern face as i
f wishing to mak
e the visitor fe
el that the abse
nce of the old 
prince had not d
isturbed the ord
er of things in 
"the house,
info"
rmed him that th
e princess had g
one to her own a
"partments, and t"
hat she receive
d on Sundays.  
 “Announce me.
 Perhaps she wil
"l see me,” sai"
d Pierre.  “
"Yes, sir,” sai"
d the man. “Pl
ease step into t
he portrait gall
ery.”  A few
 minutes later t
he footman retur
ned with Dessall
"es, who brought"
 word from the p
rincess that she
 would be very g
lad to see Pierr
e if he would e
xcuse her want o
f ceremony and c
ome upstairs to 
her apartment. 
 In a rather lo
w room lit by on
e candle sat the
 princess and wi
th her another 
person dressed i
n black. Pierre 
remembered that 
the princess al
ways had lady co
"mpanions, but wh"
o they were and 
what they were l
ike he never kn
ew or remembered
. “This must b
e one of her com
"panions,” he
"
"thought, glancin"
g at the lady in
 the black dress
.  The princes
s rose quickly t
o meet him and h
eld out her hand
".

“Yes,” "
"she said, lookin"
g at his altered
 face after he h
ad kissed her h
"and, “so this "
is how we meet a
gain. He spoke o
f you even at th
"e very
last,”"
" she went on, tu"
rning her eyes f
rom Pierre to he
r companion with
 a shyness that
 surprised him f
or an instant. 
 “I was so gl
ad to hear of yo
ur safety. It wa
s the first piec
e of good news 
we had received 
for a long time.
”  Again the
 princess glance
d round at her c
ompanion with ev
en more uneasin
ess in her manne
r and was about 
to add something
", but Pierre
in"
terrupted her. 
 “Just imagin
e—I knew nothi
ng about him!”
 said he. “I t
hought he had be
en killed. All 
I know I heard a
t second hand fr
om others. I onl
y know that he 
fell in with the
 Rostóvs.... Wh
at a strange coi
ncidence!”  
Pierre spoke rap
idly and with an
imation. He glan
ced once at the 
 companion’s f
"ace, saw her att"
entive and kindl
y gaze fixed on 
"him, and,
as of"
ten happens when
" one is talking,"
 felt somehow th
at this companio
n in the black 
dress was a good
", kind, excellen"
t creature who w
ould not hinder
 his conversing 
freely with Prin
cess Mary.  Bu
t when he mentio
ned the Rostóvs
", Princess Mary�"
��s face express
ed still greate
r embarrassment.
 She again glanc
ed rapidly from 
Pierre’s face 
to that of the 
lady in the blac
k dress and said
:  “Do you r
eally not recogn
ize her?”  P
ierre looked aga
in at the compan
"ion’s pale, de"
licate face with
 its black eyes
 and peculiar mo
"uth, and somethi"
"ng near to him, "
long forgotten 
and more than sw
"eet, looked at h"
im from those at
tentive eyes.  
"
“But no, it c"
an’t be!” he
 thought. “Thi
"s stern, thin, p"
ale face that l
ooks so much old
er! It cannot be
 she. It merely 
reminds me of he
r.” But at th
at moment Prince
"ss Mary said, �"
�Natásha!” An
d with difficult
"y,
effort, and "
"stress, like the"
 opening of a do
or grown rusty o
"n its
hinges, a"
 smile appeared 
on the face with
 the attentive e
"yes, and from
t"
hat opening door
 came a breath o
f fragrance whic
h suffused Pierr
e with a happin
ess he had long 
forgotten and of
 which he had no
t even been thi
nking—especial
ly at that momen
t. It suffused h
"im, seized him, "
and enveloped h
im completely. W
hen she smiled d
oubt was no long
"er possible,
it"
 was Natásha an
d he loved her. 
  At that momen
t Pierre involun
tarily betrayed 
"to her, to Princ"
"ess Mary,
and a"
bove all to hims
"elf, a secret of"
 which he himsel
f had been unawa
re. He flushed 
joyfully yet wit
h painful distre
ss. He tried to 
hide his agitat
ion. But the mor
e he tried to hi
de it the more c
learly—clearer
 than any words
 could have done
—did he betray
" to himself, to "
"her, and to
Pri"
ncess Mary that 
he loved her.  
"
“No, it’s o"
nly the unexpect
"edness of it,”"
 thought Pierre.
 But as soon as 
 he tried to con
tinue the conver
sation he had be
gun with Princes
s Mary he again
 glanced at Nat�
"�sha, and a stil"
l-deeper flush s
uffused his face
 and a still-st
ronger agitation
 of mingled joy 
and fear seized 
his soul. He be
came confused in
 his speech and 
stopped in the m
iddle of what he
 was saying.  
 Pierre had fail
ed to notice Nat
ásha because he
 did not at all 
expect to see h
"er there, but he"
 had failed to r
ecognize her bec
ause the change 
in her since he
 last saw her wa
s immense. She h
ad grown thin an
"d pale, but
tha"
t was not what m
ade her unrecogn
izable; she was 
unrecognizable a
t the moment he
 entered because
 on that face wh
ose eyes had alw
ays shone with 
a suppressed smi
le of the joy of
" life, now when "
he first entered
 and glanced at
 her there was n
ot the least sha
dow of a smile: 
only her eyes w
ere kindly atten
tive and sadly i
nterrogative.  
 Pierre’s conf
usion was not re
flected by any c
onfusion on Nat�
"�sha’s part,
"
but only by the 
pleasure that ju
st perceptibly l
it up her whole 
face.      
 CHAPTER XVI  
“She has come 
"to stay with me,"
” said Princes
s Mary. “The c
ount and counte
ss will be here 
in a few days. T
he countess is i
n a dreadful st
ate; but it was 
necessary for Na
tásha herself t
o see a doctor. 
They insisted o
n her coming wit
h me.”  “Y
"es, is there a f"
amily free from 
sorrow now?” s
"aid Pierre, addr"
essing Natásha
. “You know it
 happened the ve
ry day we were r
escued. I saw hi
m. What a delig
htful boy he was
!”  Natásha
" looked at him, "
and by way of an
swer to his word
s her eyes wide
ned and lit up. 
  “What can o
ne say or think 
of as a consolat
ion?” said Pie
rre. “Nothing!
 Why had such a
" splendid boy, s"
"o full of life, "
to die?”  �
"�Yes, in these d"
ays it would be 
hard to live wit
hout faith...”
 remarked Princ
ess Mary.  “
"Yes, yes, that i"
"s really true,�"
� Pierre hastily
 interrupted her
.  “Why is i
t true?” Natá
"sha asked, looki"
ng attentively i
nto Pierre’s e
yes.  “How c
an you ask why?�
�� said Princess
 Mary. “The th
ought alone of w
hat awaits...�
�  Natásha wi
thout waiting fo
r Princess Mary 
to finish again 
looked inquirin
gly at Pierre. 
 “And because
",” Pierre cont"
"inued, “only o"
ne who believes 
that there is a 
 God ruling us c
an bear a loss s
uch as hers and.
.. yours.”  
Natásha had alr
eady opened her 
mouth to speak b
ut suddenly stop
ped. Pierre hur
riedly turned aw
ay from her and 
again addressed 
"Princess Mary,
"
asking about his
 friend’s last
 days.  Pierre
’s confusion h
ad now almost va
"nished, but at t"
he same time he 
felt that his f
reedom had also 
completely gone.
 He felt that th
ere was now a j
udge of his ever
y word and actio
n whose judgment
 mattered more t
o him than that
 of all the rest
 of the world. A
s he spoke now h
e was consideri
ng what impressi
on his words wou
ld make on Natá
sha. He did not
 purposely say t
hings to please 
"her, but whateve"
r he was saying 
he regarded fro
m her standpoint
.  Princess Ma
ry—reluctantly
 as is usual in 
such cases—beg
an telling of t
he condition in 
which she had fo
und Prince Andre
w. But Pierre’
s face quiverin
"g with emotion, "
his questions an
d his eager rest
"less expression,"
 gradually comp
elled her to go 
into details whi
ch she feared to
 recall for her
 own sake.  �
"�Yes, yes, and s"
o...?” Pierre 
kept saying as h
e leaned toward 
her with his wh
ole body and eag
erly listened to
 her story. “Y
"es, yes... so he"
 grew tranquil 
and softened? Wi
th all his soul 
he had always so
ught one thing�
��to be perfectl
y good—so he c
ould not be afra
id of death. The
 faults he had�
��if he had any�
��were not of hi
s making. So he 
did soften?... 
What a happy thi
ng that he saw y
"ou again,” he "
"added, suddenly "
turning to Nat�
�sha and looking
 at her with eye
s full of tears.
  Natásha’s
 face twitched. 
She frowned and 
lowered her eyes
 for a moment. 
She hesitated fo
r an instant whe
ther to speak or
" not.

“Yes,"
 that was happin
"ess,” she then"
 said in her qui
et voice with it
s deep chest no
tes. “For me i
t certainly was 
happiness.” Sh
e paused. “And
 he... he... he
 said he was wis
hing for it at t
he very moment I
 entered the ro
om....”  Nat
ásha’s voice 
broke. She blush
"ed, pressed her "
clasped hands on
" her
knees, and"
 then controllin
g herself with a
n evident effort
 lifted her hea
d and began to s
peak rapidly.  
 “We knew noth
ing of it when w
e started from M
oscow. I did not
 dare to ask ab
out him. Then su
ddenly Sónya to
ld me he was tra
veling with us. 
I had no idea a
nd could not ima
gine what state 
"he was in, all I"
 wanted was to 
see him and be w
"ith him,” she "
"said, trembling,"
 and breathing q
uickly.  And n
ot letting them 
interrupt her sh
e went on to tel
l what she had 
never yet mentio
ned to anyone—
all she had live
d through during
 those three we
eks of their jou
rney and life at
 Yaroslávl.  
Pierre listened 
to her with lips
 parted and eyes
 fixed upon her 
full of tears. 
As he listened h
e did not think 
of Prince Andrew
", nor of death,"
 nor of what she
 was telling. He
 listened to her
 and felt only p
"ity for
her, fo"
r what she was s
uffering now whi
le she was speak
ing.  Princess
" Mary, frowning "
in her effort to
 hold back her t
"ears, sat beside"
"
Natásha, and "
heard for the fi
rst time the sto
ry of those last
 days of her br
other’s and Na
tásha’s love.
  Evidently Na
tásha needed to
 tell that painf
ul yet joyful ta
le.  She spoke
", mingling most "
trifling details
 with the intima
te secrets of h
"er soul, and it "
seemed as if she
 could never fin
ish. Several tim
es she repeated
 the same thing 
twice.  Dessal
les’ voice was
 heard outside t
he door asking w
hether little N
icholas might co
me in to say goo
d night.  “W
"ell, that’s al"
"l—everything,�"
�� said Natásha
.  She got up 
quickly just as 
Nicholas entered
", almost ran to "
the door which 
was hidden by cu
"rtains, struck h"
er head against 
"it, and rushed
"
from the room wi
th a moan either
 of pain or sorr
ow.  Pierre ga
zed at the door 
through which sh
e had disappeare
d and did not u
nderstand why he
 suddenly felt a
ll alone in the 
world.  Prince
ss Mary roused h
im from his abst
raction by drawi
ng his attention
 to her nephew 
who had entered 
the room.  At 
that moment of e
motional tendern
ess young Nichol
"as’ face, whic"
h resembled his
" father’s, aff"
ected Pierre so 
much that when h
e had kissed th
e boy he got up 
"quickly, took ou"
t his handkerchi
"ef, and went to "
the window. He 
wished to take l
eave of Princess
" Mary, but she w"
ould not let hi
"m go.

“No, "
Natásha and I s
ometimes don’t
 go to sleep til
"l after two, so "
please don’t 
go. I will order
 supper. Go down
"stairs, we will "
come immediately
.”  Before P
ierre left the r
oom Princess Mar
y told him: “T
his is the first
 time she has t
alked of him lik
e that.”   
   CHAPTER XV
II  Pierre was
 shown into the 
"large, brightly "
lit dining room;
 a few minutes 
later he heard f
ootsteps and Pri
ncess Mary enter
ed with Natásha
. Natásha was 
"calm, though a s"
evere and grave 
expression had a
gain settled on 
her face. They 
all three of the
m now experience
d that feeling o
f awkwardness w
hich usually fol
lows after a ser
ious and heartfe
lt talk. It is 
impossible to go
 back to the sam
"e conversation, "
to talk of trifl
"es is
awkward, "
and yet the desi
re to speak is t
here and silence
 seems like aff
ectation. They w
ent silently to 
table. The footm
en drew back the
 chairs and pus
hed them up agai
n. Pierre unfold
ed his cold tabl
"e napkin
and, r"
esolving to brea
"k the silence, l"
ooked at Natásh
a and at Princes
s Mary. They ha
d evidently both
 formed the same
 resolution; the
 eyes of both s
hone with satisf
action and a con
fession that bes
ides sorrow life
 also has joy. 
  “Do you tak
"e vodka, Count?�"
�� asked Princes
"s Mary, and thos"
e words suddenl
y banished the s
hadows of the pa
st. “Now tell 
us about yoursel
"f,”
said she."
 “One hears su
ch improbable wo
nders about you.
"”

“Yes,�"
� replied Pierre
 with the smile 
of mild irony no
w habitual to hi
m. “They even
 tell me wonders
 I myself never 
dreamed of! Mary
 Abrámovna inv
ited me to her h
ouse and kept te
lling me what ha
"d happened, or o"
ught to have ha
"ppened, to me. S"
tepán Stepányc
h also instructe
d me how I ought
 to tell of my 
experiences. In 
general I have n
oticed that it i
s very easy to 
be an interestin
g man (I am an i
nteresting man n
ow); people inv
ite me out and t
ell me all about
 myself.”  N
atásha smiled a
nd was on the po
int of speaking.
  “We have b
"een told,” Pri"
ncess Mary inter
"rupted her, “t"
hat you lost two
 millions in Mo
scow. Is that tr
ue?”  “But
 I am three time
s as rich as bef
"ore,” returned"
 Pierre.  Thou
gh the position 
was now altered 
by his decision 
to pay his wife�
��s debts and t
o rebuild his ho
"uses, Pierre sti"
ll maintained th
at he had becom
e three times as
 rich as before.
  “What I ha
ve certainly gai
"ned is freedom,�"
�� he began seri
"ously, but did
"
"not continue, no"
ticing that this
 theme was too e
gotistic.  “
And are you buil
ding?”  “Y
es. Savélich sa
ys I must!”  
"
“Tell me, you"
 did not know of
 the countess’
 death when you 
decided to rema
in in Moscow?”
 asked Princess 
Mary and immedia
"tely blushed, no"
ticing that her
" question, follo"
wing his mention
" of freedom, asc"
ribed to his wo
rds a meaning he
 had perhaps not
 intended.  �
"�No,” answered"
" Pierre, evident"
ly not consideri
ng awkward the m
eaning Princess
 Mary had given 
to his words. �
�I heard of it i
n Orël and you 
 cannot imagine 
how it shocked m
e. We were not a
n exemplary coup
"le,” he
added"
" quickly, glanci"
ng at Natásha a
nd noticing on h
er face curiosit
y as to how he 
would speak of h
"is wife, “but "
her death shocke
d me terribly. 
When two people 
quarrel they are
 always both in 
"fault, and one�"
�s own guilt su
ddenly becomes t
erribly serious 
when the other i
s no longer ali
ve. And then suc
h a death... wit
hout friends and
 without consola
tion! I am very
", very sorry for"
" her,” he conc"
"luded, and was p"
leased to notice
 a look of glad
 approval on Nat
ásha’s face. 
"

“Yes, and s"
o you are once m
ore an eligible 
"bachelor,” sai"
d Princess Mary
.  Pierre sudd
enly flushed cri
mson and for a l
ong time tried n
ot to look at N
atásha. When he
 ventured to gla
nce her way agai
n her face was c
"old,
stern, and"
 he fancied even
 contemptuous. 
 “And did you
 really see and 
speak to Napoleo
"n, as we have be"
en told?” sai
d Princess Mary.
  Pierre laugh
"ed.

“No, no"
t once! Everybod
y seems to imagi
ne that being ta
ken prisoner me
ans being Napole
on’s guest. No
t only did I nev
er see him but I
 heard nothing 
about him—I wa
s in much lower 
company!”  S
"upper was over, "
and Pierre who a
t first declined
 to speak about 
his captivity w
as gradually led
 on to do so.  
 “But it’s t
rue that you rem
ained in Moscow 
to kill Napoleon
?” Natásha a
sked with a slig
ht smile. “I g
uessed it then w
hen we met at th
e Súkharev tow
"er, do you remem"
ber?”  Pierr
e admitted that 
"it was true, and"
 from that was g
radually led by 
 Princess Mary�
�s questions and
 especially by N
atásha’s into
 giving a detai
led account of h
is adventures. 
 At first he sp
oke with the amu
sed and mild iro
ny now customary
 with him towar
d everybody and 
especially towar
"d himself, but w"
hen he came to 
describe the hor
rors and sufferi

ssed he was unc
onsciously carri
ed away and bega
n speaking with 
the suppressed 
emotion of a man
 re-experiencing
 in recollection
 strong impressi
ons he has live
d through.  Pr
incess Mary with
 a gentle smile 
looked now at Pi
erre and now at 
 Natásha. In th
e whole narrativ
e she saw only P
ierre and his go
odness. Natásh
"a, leaning on he"
"r elbow, the exp"
ression of her f
ace constantly 
changing with th
"e narrative, wat"
ched Pierre with
 an attention th
at never wander
ed—evidently h
erself experienc
ing all that he 
described. Not o
"nly
her look, b"
ut her exclamati
ons and the brie
f questions she 
"put, showed
Pie"
rre that she und
erstood just wha
t he wished to c
onvey. It was cl
ear that she un
derstood not onl
y what he said b
ut also what he 
"wished to,
but "
"could not, expre"
ss in words. The
 account Pierre 
gave of the inci
dent with the c
hild and the wom
an for protectin
g whom he was ar
rested was this
: “It was an a
wful sight—chi
"ldren abandoned,"
 some in the fla
mes... One was 
snatched out bef
ore my eyes... a
nd there were wo
men who had the
ir things snatch
ed off and their
 earrings torn o
ut...” he flus
hed and grew co
nfused. “Then 
a patrol arrived
 and all the men
—all those who
 were not looti
"ng, that is—we"
"re arrested, and"
 I among them.�
�  “I am sur
e you’re not t
elling us everyt
hing; I am sure 
you did somethi
ng...” said Na
tásha and pausi
"ng added, “som"
ething fine?” 
  Pierre contin
ued. When he spo
ke of the execut
ion he wanted to
 pass over the 
horrible details
", but Natásha i"
nsisted that he 
should not omit 
 anything.  Pi
erre began to te
ll about Karatá
"ev, but paused. "
By this time he 
had risen from 
the table and wa
s pacing the roo
"m, Natásha foll"
owing him with 
her eyes. Then h
e added:  “N
"o, you can’t u"
nderstand what I
 learned from th
at illiterate ma
n—that simple
 fellow.”  �
"��Yes, yes, go o"
n!” said Natá
sha. “Where is
 he?”  “Th
ey killed him al
most before my e
yes.”  And P
"ierre, his voice"
 trembling conti
"nually, went on "
to tell of the l
ast days of the
"ir retreat, of K"
aratáev’s ill
ness and his dea
th.  He told o
f his adventures
 as he had never
 yet recalled th
"em. He now, as
"
"it were, saw a n"
ew meaning in al
l he had gone th
rough. Now that 
he was telling 
it all to Natás
ha he experience
d that pleasure 
which a man has 
 when women list
en to him—not 
clever women who
 when listening 
either try to r
emember what the
y hear to enrich
 their minds and
 when opportunit
y offers to ret
"ell it, or who w"
ish to adopt it 
to some thought 
of their own an
d promptly contr
ibute their own 
clever comments 
prepared in thei
r little mental
 workshop—but 
the pleasure giv
en by real women
 gifted with a 
capacity to sele
ct and absorb th
e very best a ma
n shows of himse
lf. Natásha wi
thout knowing it
 was all attenti
on: she did not 
"lose a word,
no"
 single quiver i
n Pierre’s voi
"ce, no look, no "
twitch of a musc
"le in
his face,"
 nor a single ge
sture. She caugh
t the unfinished
 word in its fl
ight and took it
 straight into h
"er open heart, d"
ivining the secr
et meaning of a
ll Pierre’s me
ntal travail.  
 Princess Mary u
nderstood his st
ory and sympathi
"zed with him, bu"
t she now saw s
omething else th
at absorbed all 
her attention. S
he saw the poss
ibility of love 
and happiness be
tween Natásha a
"nd Pierre, and t"
he first though
t of this filled
 her heart with 
gladness.  It 
was three o’cl
ock in the morni
ng. The footmen 
came in with sad
 and stern face
s to change the 
"candles, but no "
one noticed them
.  Pierre fini
shed his story. 
Natásha continu
ed to look at hi
m intently with
" bright, attenti"
"ve, and animated"
" eyes, as if try"
ing to understan
d something mor
e which he had p
erhaps left unto
ld. Pierre in sh
amefaced and ha
ppy confusion gl
anced occasional
"ly at her, and t"
ried to think wh
at to say next 
to introduce a f
resh subject. Pr
incess Mary was 
silent. It occu
rred to none of 
them that it was
 three o’clock
 and time to go 
to bed.  “P
eople speak of m
isfortunes and s
"ufferings,” re"
"marked Pierre, �"
��but if at thi
s moment I were 
asked: ‘Would 
you rather be wh
at you were befo
re you were tak
"en prisoner, or "
go through all t
his again?’ th
en for heaven�
�s sake let me a
gain have captiv
ity and horsefle
sh! We imagine 
that when we are
 thrown out of o
ur usual ruts al
"l is lost, but i"
t is only then 
that what is new
 and good begins
. While there is
 life there is 
happiness. There
" is much, much b"
efore us. I say 
"this to you,” "
"he added,
turni"
ng to Natásha. 
"

“Yes, yes,�"
"�� she said, ans"
wering something
 quite different
. “I too shoul
d wish nothing 
but to relive it
 all from the be
ginning.”  P
ierre looked int
ently at her.  
"
“Yes, and not"
"hing more,” sa"
id Natásha.  
“It’s not tr
"ue, not true!”"
 cried Pierre. �
��I am not to bl
ame for being a
live and wishing
 to live—nor y
ou either.”  
 Suddenly Natás
ha bent her head
", covered her fa"
ce with her hand
"s, and
began to"
 cry.  “What
" is it, Natásha"
?” said Prince
ss Mary.  “N
"othing, nothing."
” She smiled a
t Pierre through
 her tears. “G
ood night! It i
s time for bed.�
��  Pierre ros
e and took his l
eave.   Princ
ess Mary and Nat
ásha met as usu
al in the bedroo
m. They talked o
f what Pierre h
ad told them. Pr
incess Mary did 
not express her 
opinion of Pier
re nor did Natá
sha speak of him
".

“Well, go"
"od night, Mary!�"
�� said Natásha
. “Do you know
", I am often afr"
aid that by not
 speaking of him
” (she meant P
rince Andrew) �
�for fear of not
 doing justice 
"to our feelings,"
 we forget him.�
��  Princess M
ary sighed deepl
y and thereby ac
knowledged the j
ustice of Natá
"sha’s remark, "
but she did not 
express agreemen
t in words.  �
��Is it possible
 to forget?” s
aid she.  “I
t did me so much
 good to tell al
l about it today
. It was hard an
"d
painful, but "
"good, very good!"
” said Natásh
a. “I am sure 
he really loved 
 him. That is wh
y I told him... 
Was it all right
"?” she added, "
suddenly blushi
ng.  “To tel
"l Pierre? Oh, ye"
s. What a splend
id man he is!”
 said Princess 
Mary.  “Do y
"ou know, Mary..."
” Natásha sud
denly said with 
a mischievous sm
ile such as Pri
ncess Mary had n
ot seen on her f
ace for a long t
"ime, “he has
"
somehow grown so
" clean, smooth, "
and fresh—as i
f he had just co
me out of a Rus
sian bath; do yo
u understand? Ou
t of a moral bat
h. Isn’t it tr
ue?”  “Yes
",” replied Pri"
ncess Mary. “H
e has greatly im
proved.”  �
�With a short co
at and his hair 
cropped; just as
" if, well, just "
as if he had co
me straight from
 the bath... Pap
a used to...” 
  “I understa
nd why he” (Pr
ince Andrew) “
liked no one so 
"much as him,”"
 said Princess M
"ary.

“Yes, "
and yet he is qu
ite different. T
hey say men are 
friends when the
y are quite dif
ferent. That mus
t be true. Reall
y he is quite un
like him—in e
verything.”  
"
“Yes, but he�"
��s wonderful.�
"�

“Well, go"
"od night,” sai"
d Natásha.  A
nd the same misc
hievous smile li
ngered for a lon
g time on her fa
ce as if it had
 been forgotten 
there.     
 CHAPTER XVIII 
  It was a long
 time before Pie
rre could fall a
sleep that night
. He paced up a
nd down his room
", now turning hi"
s thoughts on a 
difficult proble
"m
and frowning,"
 now suddenly sh
rugging his shou
lders and wincin
"g, and now
smil"
ing happily.  
He was thinking 
of Prince Andrew
", of Natásha, a"
nd of their love
", at one
moment"
 jealous of her 
"past, then repro"
aching himself f
or that feeling.
 It was already
 six in the morn
ing and he still
 paced up and do
wn the room.  
"
“Well, what�"
�s to be done if
 it cannot be av
oided? What’s 
to be done? Evi
dently it has to
" be so,” said "
"he to himself, a"
nd hastily undre
ssing he got in
"to bed, happy an"
d agitated but f
ree from hesitat
ion or indecisi
on.  “Strang
e and impossible
 as such happine
"ss seems, I must"
 do everything 
that she and I m
ay be man and wi
"fe,” he told h"
imself.  A few
 days previously
 Pierre had deci
ded to go to Pet
ersburg on the 
Friday. When he 
awoke on the Thu
"rsday, Savélich"
 came to ask him
 about packing 
for the journey.
"

“What, to "
Petersburg? What
 is Petersburg? 
Who is there in 
Petersburg?” 
he asked involun
"tarily, though o"
nly to himself. 
"“Oh, yes, long"
 ago before thi
s happened I did
 for some reason
 mean to go to P
"etersburg,”
h"
e reflected. “
Why? But perhaps
 I shall go. Wha
t a good fellow 
he is and how a
"ttentive, and ho"
w he remembers e
"verything,” he"
" thought, lookin"
g at Savélich�
"��s old face, �"
�and what a plea
sant smile he ha
s!”  “Well
", Savélich, do "
you still not wi
sh to accept you
r freedom?” Pi
erre asked him.
  “What’s 
the good of free
"dom to me, your "
excellency? We l
ived under the 
late count—the
 kingdom of heav
en be his!—and
 we have lived u
"nder you
too, w"
ithout ever bein
g wronged.”  
 “And your chi
ldren?”  “
The children wil
l live just the 
same. With such 
masters one can 
live.”  “B
ut what about my
 heirs?” said 
Pierre. “Suppo
sing I suddenly 
marry... it mig
"ht happen,” he"
 added with an i
nvoluntary smile
.  “If I may
 take the libert
"y, your excellen"
"cy, it would be "
a good thing.”
  “How easy 
"he thinks it,”"
 thought Pierre.
 “He doesn’t
 know how terrib
le it is and ho
w dangerous. Too
 soon or too lat
e... it is terri
ble!”  “So
 what are your o
rders? Are you s
tarting tomorrow
?” asked Savé
"lich.

“No, "
I’ll put it of
f for a bit. I�
�ll tell you lat
er. You must for
give the troubl
e I have put you
" to,” said Pie"
"rre, and seeing "
"Savélich smile,"
 he thought: �
�But how strange
 it is that he s
hould not know t
hat now there i
s no Petersburg 
"for me, and that"
 that must be se
ttled first of 
all! But probabl
y he knows it we
ll enough and is
 only pretending
. Shall I have 
a talk with him 
and see what he 
thinks?” Pierr
e reflected. “
"No,
another tim"
e.”  At brea
kfast Pierre tol
"d the princess, "
"his cousin, that"
 he had been to 
 see Princess Ma
ry the day befor
e and had there 
met—“Whom do
 you think? Nat
ásha Rostóva!�
��  The prince
ss seemed to see
 nothing more ex
traordinary in t
hat than if he 
had seen Anna Se
mënovna.  “
Do you know her?
” asked Pierre
.  “I have s
een the princess
",” she replied"
. “I heard tha
t they were arr
anging a match f
or her with youn
g Rostóv. It wo
uld be a very go
od thing for th
"e Rostóvs, they"
 are said to be 
utterly ruined.�
��  “No; I m
ean do you know 
Natásha Rostóv
a?”  “I he
ard about that a
ffair of hers at
 the time. It wa
s a great pity.�
"��

“No, she"
 either doesn’
t understand or 
"is pretending,�"
� thought Pierre
. “Better not
 say anything to
 her either.” 
  The princess 
too had prepared
 provisions for 
Pierre’s journ
ey.  “How ki
"nd they all are,"
” thought Pier
re. “What is s
urprising is tha
t they should t
rouble about the
se things now wh
en it can no lon
ger be of inter
est to them. And
 all for me!” 
  On the same d
ay the Chief of 
Police came to P
"ierre, inviting "
him to send a r
epresentative to
 the Faceted Pal
ace to recover t
hings that were 
to be returned 
to their owners 
that day.  “
And this man too
",” thought Pie"
"rre, looking int"
o the face of th
e Chief of Poli
ce. “What a fi
"ne, good-looking"
 officer and how
 kind. Fancy bo
thering about su
ch trifles now! 
And they actuall
y say he is not 
honest and take
s bribes. What n
onsense! Besides
", why shouldn’"
t he take bribes
? That’s the 
way he was broug
"ht up, and every"
body does it. Bu
"t what a
kind, "
pleasant face an
d how he smiles 
as he looks at m
e.”  Pierre 
went to Princess
 Mary’s to din
ner.  As he dr
ove through the 
streets past the
 houses that had
 been burned do
"wn, he was surpr"
ised by the beau
ty of those ruin
s. The picturesq
ueness of the c
himney stacks an
d tumble-down wa
lls of the burne
d-out quarters 
"of the town, str"
etching out and 
concealing one a
"nother, reminded"
 him of the Rhi
ne and the Colos
seum. The cabmen
 he met and thei
"r passengers,
t"
he carpenters cu
tting the timber
 for new houses 
"with axes, the w"
"omen
hawkers, a"
nd the shopkeepe
"rs, all looked a"
t him with cheer
ful beaming eye
s that seemed to
" say: “Ah, the"
re he is! Let’
s see what will 
come of it!” 
  At the entran
ce to Princess M
ary’s house Pi
erre felt doubtf
ul whether he h
ad really been t
here the night b
efore and really
 seen Natásha a
nd talked to he
r. “Perhaps I 
imagined it; per
haps I shall go 
in and find no 
one there.” Bu
t he had hardly 
entered the room
 before he felt 
her presence wi
th his whole bei
ng by the loss o
f his sense of f
reedom. She was
 in the same bla
ck dress with so
ft folds and her
 hair was done t
he same way as 
"the day before, "
yet she was quit
e different. Had
 she been like 
this when he ent
ered the day bef
ore he could not
 for a moment ha
ve failed to re
cognize her.  
She was as he ha
d known her almo
st as a child an
d later on as Pr
ince Andrew’s
 fiancée. A bri
ght questioning 
light shone in h
"er eyes, and on"
 her face was a 
friendly and str
angely roguish e
xpression.  Pi
erre dined with 
them and would h
ave spent the wh
ole evening ther
"e, but
Princess"
 Mary was going 
to vespers and P
ierre left the h
ouse with her. 
 Next day he ca
"me early, dined,"
 and stayed the 
whole evening. T
hough Princess 
Mary and Natásh
a were evidently
 glad to see the
ir visitor and 
though all Pierr
e’s interest w
as now centered 
"in that house, b"
y the evening t
hey had talked o
ver everything a
nd the conversat
ion passed from 
 one trivial top
ic to another an
d repeatedly bro
ke off. He staye
d so long that 
Princess Mary an
d Natásha excha
"nged glances, ev"
idently wonderin
g when he would
 go. Pierre noti
ced this but cou
ld not go. He fe
lt uneasy and e
"mbarrassed, but "
sat on because h
e simply could n
ot get up and ta
ke his leave. 
"
Princess Mary,"
 foreseeing no e
"nd to this, rose"
" first, and comp"
laining of a he
adache began to 
say good night. 
  “So you are
 going to Peters
burg tomorrow?�
� she asked.  
"“No, I am not "
"going,” Pierre"
 replied hastily
", in a surprised"
 tone and as th
ough offended. �
��Yes... no... t
o Petersburg? To
morrow—but I w
on’t say good
-by yet. I will 
call round in ca
se you have any 
commissions for 
"me,”
said he,"
 standing before
 Princess Mary a
"nd turning red, "
but not taking 
his departure. 
 Natásha gave 
him her hand and
 went out. Princ
ess Mary on the 
other hand inst
ead of going awa
y sank into an a
"rmchair, and loo"
ked sternly and 
 intently at him
" with her deep, "
radiant eyes. Th
e weariness she 
 had plainly sho
wn before had no
w quite passed o
ff. With a deep 
and long-drawn 
sigh she seemed 
to be prepared f
or a lengthy tal
k.  When Natá
sha left the roo
m Pierre’s con
fusion and awkwa
rdness immediat
ely vanished and
 were replaced b
y eager exciteme
nt. He quickly 
moved an armchai
r toward Princes
s Mary.  “Ye
"s, I wanted to t"
"ell you,” said"
" he, answering h"
er look as if sh
e had spoken. �
"��Princess, help"
 me! What am I t
o do? Can I hope
"? Princess, my
"
"dear friend, lis"
ten! I know it a
ll. I know I am 
not worthy of he
"r, I
know it’"
s impossible to 
speak of it now.
 But I want to b
e a brother to 
"her. No, not tha"
"t, I don’t, I "
can’t...”  
 He paused and r
ubbed his face a
nd eyes with his
 hands.  “We
"ll,” he went o"
n with an eviden
t effort at self
-control and coh
erence. “I do
n’t know when 
I began to love 
"her, but I have "
loved her and he
r alone all my 
"life, and I love"
 her so that I c
annot imagine li
fe without her.
 I cannot propos
e to her at pres
"ent, but the tho"
ught that perha
ps she might som
eday be my wife 
and that I may b
e missing that 
possibility... t
hat possibility.
.. is terrible. 
"Tell me, can I h"
ope? Tell me wh
"at I am to do, d"
ear princess!”
 he added after 
"a pause, and
to"
uched her hand a
s she did not re
ply.  “I am 
thinking of what
 you have told m
"e,” answered P"
rincess Mary. �
��This is what I
 will say. You a
re right that to
 speak to her of
 love at presen
t...”  Princ
ess Mary stopped
. She was going 
to say that to s
peak of love was
"
impossible, bu"
t she stopped be
cause she had se
en by the sudden
 change in Nat�
�sha two days be
fore that she wo
uld not only not
 be hurt if Pier
re spoke of his
" love, but that "
it was the very 
thing she wished
 for.  “To s
peak to her now 
"wouldn’t do,�"
� said the princ
ess all the same
.  “But what
 am I to do?” 
  “Leave it t
"o me,” said Pr"
incess Mary. “
I know...”  
Pierre was looki
ng into Princess
 Mary’s eyes. 
  “Well?... W
ell?...” he sa
id.  “I know
 that she loves.
.. will love you
",” Princess Ma"
ry corrected he
rself.  Before
 her words were 
"out, Pierre had "
sprung up and wi
th a frightened 
 expression seiz
ed Princess Mary
’s hand.  �
�What makes you 
think so? You th
ink I may hope? 
You think...?”
"

“Yes, I th"
"ink so,” said "
Princess Mary wi
th a smile. “W
rite to her par
"ents, and leave "
it to me. I will
 tell her when I
 can. I wish it 
to happen and m
y heart tells me
 it will.”  
"“No, it cannot"
 be! How happy I
 am! But it can�
��t be.... How h
"appy I am!
No, "
it can’t be!�
� Pierre kept sa
ying as he kisse
d Princess Mary�
��s hands.  �
�Go to Petersbur
"g, that will be "
best. And I will
" write to you,�"
� she said.  
“To Petersburg
? Go there? Very
" well, I’ll go"
. But I may come
 again tomorrow
?”  Next day
 Pierre came to 
say good-by. Nat
ásha was less a
nimated than sh
e had been the d
ay before; but t
hat day as he lo
oked at her Pier
re sometimes fe
lt as if he was 
vanishing and th
at neither he no
r she existed a
"ny longer, that "
nothing existed 
but happiness. �
��Is it possible
"?
No, it can’"
"t be,” he told"
 himself at ever
"y look, gesture,"
 and word that 
filled his soul 
with joy.  Whe
n on saying good
-by he took her 
"thin, slender ha"
"nd, he could not"
 help holding i
t a little longe
r in his own.  
 “Is it possib
le that this han
"d, that face, th"
"ose eyes, all th"
is treasure of 
feminine charm s
o strange to me 
"now, is it possi"
ble that it will
 one day be min
"e forever, as fa"
miliar to me as 
I am to myself?.
".. No, that’s"
 impossible!...�
��  “Good-by
", Count,” she "
said aloud. “I
 shall look forw
ard very much to
"
your return,�"
� she added in a
 whisper.  And
 these simple wo
"rds, her look, a"
nd the expressio
n on her face wh
ich accompanied
" them, formed fo"
r two months the
 subject of inex
haustible memor
"ies, interpretat"
"ions, and happy "
meditations for 
Pierre. “‘I 
shall look forw
ard very much to
 your return....
"’ Yes, yes, ho"
w did she say it
"?
Yes, ‘I sha"
ll look forward 
very much to you
"r return.’ Oh,"
 how happy I am
! What is happen
ing to me? How h
appy I am!” sa
id Pierre to him
self.      
 CHAPTER XIX  
There was nothin
g in Pierre’s 
soul now at all 
like what had tr
oubled it durin
g his courtship 
of Hélène.  
He did not repea
t to himself wit
h a sickening fe
eling of shame t
he words he had
" spoken, or say:"
" “Oh, why did "
I not say that?�
"�� and, “Whate"
ver made me say
 ‘Je vous aime
’?” On the c
"ontrary, he now "
repeated in imag
ination every w
ord that he or N
atásha had spok
en and pictured 
every detail of 
 her face and sm
"ile, and did not"
 wish to diminis
h or add anythin
"g, but
only to "
repeat it again 
and again. There
 was now not a s
hadow of doubt 
in his mind as t
o whether what h
e had undertaken
 was right or wr
ong. Only one t
errible doubt so
metimes crossed 
his mind: “Was
n’t it all a 
dream? Isn’t P
rincess Mary mis
taken? Am I not 
too conceited an
d self-confiden
t? I believe all
 this—and sudd
enly Princess Ma
ry will tell he
"r, and she will "
be sure to smile
 and say: ‘How
 strange! He mus
t be deluding h
imself. Doesn’
t he know that h
"e is a man, just"
" a man, while
I"
...? I am someth
ing altogether d
ifferent and hig
her.’”  Th
at was the only 
doubt often trou
bling Pierre. He
 did not now mak
e any plans. Th
e happiness befo
re him appeared 
so inconceivable
 that if only h
e could attain i
"t, it would be t"
he end of all th
ings. Everything
 ended with tha
"t.

A joyful, "
unexpected frenz
"y, of which he h"
ad thought himse
"lf incapable,
p"
ossessed him. Th
e whole meaning 
of life—not fo
r him alone but 
for the whole w
orld—seemed to
 him centered in
 his love and th
e possibility of
 being loved by
 her. At times e
verybody seemed 
to him to be occ
upied with one 
thing only—his
 future happines
s. Sometimes it 
seemed to him th
at other people
 were all as ple
ased as he was h
imself and merel
y tried to hide
 that pleasure b
y pretending to 
be busy with oth
er interests. In
 every word and
 gesture he saw 
allusions to his
 happiness. He o
ften surprised 
those he met by 
his significantl
y happy looks an
d smiles which 
seemed to expres
s a secret under
standing between
 him and them. A
nd when he real
ized that people
 might not be aw
are of his happi
"ness, he pitied"
 them with his w
hole heart and f
elt a desire som
ehow to explain 
to them that al
l that occupied 
them was a mere 
frivolous trifle
 unworthy of at
tention.  When
 it was suggeste
d to him that he
 should enter th
"e civil service,"
 or when the wa
r or any general
 political affai
rs were discusse
d on the assump
tion that everyb
ody’s welfare 
depended on this
 or that issue 
"of events, he wo"
uld listen with 
a mild and pityi
ng smile and sur
prise people by
 his strange com
ments. But at th
is time he saw e
verybody—both 
"
those who, as h"
"e imagined, unde"
rstood the real 
meaning of life 
"(that
is, what "
he was feeling) 
and those unfort
unates who evide
ntly did not un
derstand it—in
 the bright ligh
t of the emotion
 that shone with
"in
himself, and"
 at once without
 any effort saw 
in everyone he m
et everything t
hat was good and
 worthy of being
 loved.  When 
dealing with the
 affairs and pap
ers of his dead 
"wife, her memory"
 aroused in him
 no feeling but 
pity that she ha
d not known the 
bliss he now kn
ew. Prince Vasí
"li, who having o"
btained a new po
st and some fre
sh decorations w
as particularly 
proud at this ti
"me, seemed to hi"
"m a
pathetic, k"
indly old man mu
ch to be pitied.
  Often in aft
erlife Pierre re
called this peri
od of blissful i
nsanity. All th
e views he forme
d of men and cir
cumstances at th
is time remained
 true for him a
lways. He not on
ly did not renou
nce them subsequ
"ently, but when"
 he was in doubt
 or inwardly at 
"variance, he ref"
erred to the vie
ws he had held 
at this time of 
his madness and 
they always prov
ed correct.  �
��I may have app
eared strange an
"d queer then,”"
" he thought, “"
but I was not s
o mad as I seeme
d. On the contra
ry I was then wi
ser and had mor
e insight than a
t any other time
", and understood"
 all that is wor
th understandin
"g in life, becau"
se... because I 
was happy.”  
 Pierre’s insa
nity consisted i
"n not waiting, a"
"s he used to do,"
 to discover pe
rsonal attribute
s which he terme
d “good qualit
ies” in people
 before loving 
them; his heart 
was now overflow
"ing with love, a"
nd by loving pe
ople without cau
se he discovered
 indubitable cau
ses for loving 
them.      
 CHAPTER XX  A
fter Pierre’s 
departure that f
"irst evening, wh"
en Natásha had 
said to Princes
s Mary with a ga
ily mocking smil
e: “He looks j
"ust, yes, just a"
s if he had com
e out of a Russi
an bath—in a s
hort coat and wi
th his hair cro
"pped,” somethi"
ng hidden and un
known to herself
", but irrepressi"
"ble,
awoke in N"
atásha’s soul
.  Everything:
" her face, walk,"
" look, and voice"
", was suddenly a"
ltered. To her 
own surprise a p
ower of life and
 hope of happine
ss rose to the 
surface and dema
nded satisfactio
n. From that eve
ning she seemed 
to have forgott
en all that had 
happened to her.
 She no longer c
omplained of her
"
position, did "
not say a word a
"bout the past, a"
nd no longer fea
red to make hap
py plans for the
 future. She spo
ke little of Pie
"rre, but when
P"
rincess Mary men
tioned him a lon
g-extinguished l
ight once more k
indled in her e
yes and her lips
 curved with a s
trange smile.  
 The change that
 took place in N
atásha at first
 surprised Princ
ess Mary; but w
hen she understo
od its meaning i
t grieved her. �
��Can she have l
oved my brother
 so little as to
 be able to forg
et him so soon?�
�� she thought 
when she reflect
ed on the change
. But when she w
as with Natásha
 she was not ve
xed with her and
 did not reproac
h her. The reawa
kened power of 
life that had se
ized Natásha wa
s so evidently i
rrepressible and
 unexpected by 
her that in her 
presence Princes
s Mary felt that
 she had no rig
ht to reproach h
er even in her h
eart.  Natásh
a gave herself u
p so fully and f
rankly to this n
ew feeling that 
 she did not try
 to hide the fac
t that she was n
"o longer sad, bu"
t bright and ch
eerful.  When 
Princess Mary re
turned to her ro
om after her noc
turnal talk with
"
Pierre, Natás"
ha met her on th
e threshold.  
“He has spoken
? Yes? He has sp
oken?” she rep
eated.  And a 
joyful yet pathe
tic expression w
hich seemed to b
eg forgiveness f
or her joy sett
led on Natásha�
��s face.  “
I wanted to list
"en at the door, "
but I knew you w
ould tell me.”
  Understandab
le and touching 
as the look with
 which Natásha 
gazed at her se
emed to Princess
" Mary, and sorry"
 as she was to s
ee her agitation
",
these words p"
ained her for a 
moment. She reme
mbered her broth
er and his love
.  “But what
’s to be done?
 She can’t hel
"p it,” thought"
 the princess. 
 And with a sad
 and rather ster
n look she told 
Natásha all tha
t Pierre had sa
id. On hearing t
hat he was going
 to Petersburg N
atásha was ast
ounded.  “To
 Petersburg!” 
she repeated as 
if unable to und
erstand.  But 
noticing the gri
eved expression 
on Princess Mary
’s face she gu
essed the reaso
n of that sadnes
s and suddenly b
egan to cry.  
"“Mary,” said"
" she, “tell me"
 what I should d
o! I am afraid o
f being bad. Wh
atever you tell 
"me, I will do. T"
ell me....”  
 “You love him
"?”

“Yes,�"
�� whispered Nat
ásha.  “The
n why are you cr
ying? I am happy
" for your sake,�"
�� said Princess
" Mary,
who beca"
use of those tea
rs quite forgave
 Natásha’s jo
y.  “It won�
��t be just yet�
��someday. Think
 what fun it wil
l be when I am h
is wife and you
 marry Nicholas!
”  “Natás
"ha, I have asked"
 you not to spea
k of that. Let u
s talk about you
.”  They wer
e silent awhile.
  “But why g
o to Petersburg?
” Natásha sud
"denly asked, and"
 hastily replied
 to her own que
stion. “But no
", no, he must..."
" Yes, Mary, He m"

   FIRST EPIL

      CHAPT
ER I  Seven ye
ars had passed. 
The storm-tossed
 sea of European
 history had su
bsided within it
s shores and see
med to have beco
me calm. But the
 mysterious for
ces that move hu
manity (mysterio
us because the l
aws of their mo
tion are unknown
 to us) continue
d to operate.  
 Though the surf
ace of the sea o
f history seemed
" motionless, the"
 movement of hu
manity went on a
s unceasingly as
 the flow of tim
e. Various group
s of people for
med and dissolve
"d, the coming fo"
rmation and diss
olution of king
doms and displac
ement of peoples
 was in course o
f preparation. 
 The sea of his
tory was not dri
ven spasmodicall
y from shore to 
shore as previo
usly. It was see
thing in its dep
ths. Historic fi
gures were not 
borne by the wav
es from one shor
e to another as 
before. They now
 seemed to rota
te on one spot. 
The historical f
igures at the he
"ad of armies,
w"
ho formerly refl
ected the moveme
nt of the masses
 by ordering war
"s,
campaigns, a"
"nd battles, now "
reflected the re
stless movement 
by political an
d diplomatic com
"binations, laws,"
 and treaties. 
 The historians
 call this activ
ity of the histo
rical figures �
�the reaction.�
��  In dealing
 with this perio
d they sternly c
ondemn the histo
rical personage
"s who, in their "
"opinion, caused "
what they descri
be as the react
ion. All the wel
l-known people o
"f that period, f"
rom Alexander an
d Napoleon to M
"adame de Staël,"
" Photius, Schell"
"ing, Fichte, Cha"
"teaubriand,
and"
" the rest, pass "
before their ste
rn judgment seat
 and are acquitt
ed or condemned
 according to wh
ether they condu
ced to progress 
or to reaction. 
  According to 
their accounts a
 reaction took p
lace at that tim
e in Russia als
"o, and the chief"
 culprit was Ale
"xander I, the sa"
me man who accor
ding to them wa
s the chief caus
e of the liberal
 movement at the
 commencement o
"f his reign, bei"
ng the savior of
 Russia.  Ther
e is no one in R
ussian literatur
"e now, from scho"
olboy essayist t
o learned histo
"rian, who does n"
ot throw his lit
tle stone at Ale
xander for thin
gs he did wrong 
at this period o
f his reign.  
“He ought to h
ave acted in thi
s way and in tha
t way. In this c
ase he did well
 and in that cas
e badly. He beha
ved admirably at
 the beginning o
f his reign and
" during 1812, bu"
t acted badly by
 giving a consti
tution to Polan
"d, forming the H"
"oly Alliance, en"
trusting power t
"o Arakchéev,
f"
avoring Golítsy
"n and mysticism,"
 and afterwards 
Shishkóv and Ph
otius. He also 
acted badly by c
oncerning himsel
f with the activ
e army and disb
anding the Semë
nov regiment.”
  It would tak
e a dozen pages 
to enumerate all
 the reproaches 
the historians 
"address to him, "
based on their k
nowledge of what
 is good for hu
manity.  What 
do these reproac
hes mean?  Do 
not the very act
ions for which t
he historians pr
aise Alexander I
 (the liberal a
ttempts at the b
eginning of his 
"reign, his strug"
gle with Napole
"on, the firmness"
 he displayed in
 1812 and the ca
mpaign of 1813) 
 flow from the s
ame sources—th
e circumstances 
"of his birth, ed"
"ucation,
and li"
fe—that made h
is personality w
hat it was and f
rom which the a
ctions for which
 they blame him 
(the Holy Allian
"ce, the restorat"
"ion of
Poland, "
and the reaction
 of 1820 and lat
er) also flowed?
  In what does
 the substance o
f those reproach
es lie?  It li
es in the fact t
hat an historic 
character like A
"lexander I,
sta"
nding on the hig
hest possible pi
nnacle of human 
power with the 
blinding light o
f history focuse
d upon him; a ch
aracter exposed 
to those strong
est of all influ
ences: the intri
"gues, flattery, "
and self-decepti
on inseparable 
from power; a ch
aracter who at e
very moment of h
is life felt a 
responsibility f
or all that was 
happening in Eur
ope; and not a 
fictitious but a
 live character 
who like every m
an had his perso
"nal
habits, pas"
"sions, and impul"
ses toward goodn
"ess, beauty, and"
 truth—that t
his character—
though not lacki
ng in virtue (th
e historians do 
not accuse him 
of that)—had n
ot the same conc
eption of the we
lfare of humani
ty fifty years a
go as a present-
day professor wh
o from his yout
h upwards has be
en occupied with
 learning: that 
"is, with books a"
nd lectures and
 with taking not
es from them.  
 But even if we 
assume that fift
y years ago Alex
ander I was mist
aken in his vie
w of what was go
od for the peopl
"e, we must inevi"
tably assume tha
t the historian
 who judges Alex
ander will also 
after the lapse 
of some time tu
rn out to be mis
taken in his vie
w of what is goo
d for humanity. 
 This assumption
 is all the more
 natural and ine
"vitable because,"
 watching the m
ovement of histo
"ry, we see that "
every year and w
ith each new wr
"iter, opinion as"
 to what is good
 for mankind cha
nges; so that wh
at once seemed 
"good, ten years "
"later seems bad,"
 and vice versa.
 And what is mo
"re, we find at o"
ne and the same 
time quite contr
adictory views a
s to what is ba
d and what is go
od in history: s
ome people regar
d giving a cons
titution to Pola
nd and forming t
he Holy Alliance
 as praiseworthy
" in
Alexander, "
while others reg
ard it as blamew
orthy.  The ac
tivity of Alexan
der or of Napole
on cannot be cal
led useful or h
"armful, for it i"
s impossible to 
say for what it 
was useful or ha
rmful. If that 
activity displea
"ses somebody, th"
is is only becau
se it does not 
agree with his l
imited understan
ding of what is 
good. Whether th
e preservation 
of my father’s
 house in Moscow
", or the glory o"
f the Russian a
"rms, or the pros"
perity of the Pe
tersburg and oth
"er universities,"
 or the freedom
 of Poland or th
e greatness of R
"ussia, or the ba"
lance of power i
"n
Europe, or a "
certain kind of 
European culture
 called “progr
ess” appear t
o me to be good 
"or bad, I must a"
dmit that beside
s these things t
he action of ev
ery historic cha
racter has other
 more general pu
rposes inaccess
ible to me.  B
ut let us assume
 that what is ca
lled science can
 harmonize all 
contradictions a
nd possesses an 
unchanging stand
ard of good and 
bad by which to
 try historic ch
aracters and eve
nts; let us say 
that Alexander 
could have done 
everything diffe
rently; let us s
ay that with gui
dance from thos
e who blame him 
and who profess 
to know the ulti
mate aim of the 
 movement of hum
"anity, he might "
have arranged ma
tters according 
to the program 
his present accu
sers would have 
given him—of n
"ationality,
fre"
"edom, equality, "
and progress (th
"ese, I think, co"
ver the ground).
 Let us assume 
that this progra
m was possible a
nd had then been
" formulated,
an"
d that Alexander
 had acted on it
. What would the
n have become of
 the activity o
f all those who 
opposed the tend
ency that then p
revailed in the
 government—an
 activity that i
n the opinion of
 the historians 
was good and be
neficent? Their 
activity would n
ot have existed:
 there would ha
"ve been no life,"
 there would hav
e been nothing. 
  If we admit t
hat human life c
an be ruled by r
"eason, the possi"
bility of life 
is destroyed.  
     CHAPTER
 II  If we ass
ume as the histo
rians do that gr
eat men lead hum
anity to the at
tainment of cert
ain ends—the g
reatness of Russ
"ia or of France,"
 the balance of
 power in Europe
", the diffusion "
of the ideas of 
"the
Revolution,"
 general progres
"s, or anything e"
lse—then it is
 impossible to 
explain the fact
s of history wit
hout introducing
 the conceptions
 of chance and 
genius.  If th
e aim of the Eur
opean wars at th
e beginning of t
he nineteenth c
entury had been 
the aggrandizeme
"nt of Russia, th"
at aim might hav
e been accompli
shed without all
 the preceding w
ars and without 
the invasion. If
 the aim was th
e aggrandizement
" of France, that"
 might have been
 attained witho
ut the Revolutio
n and without th
e Empire. If the
 aim was the di
ssemination of i
"deas, the printi"
ng press could h
ave accomplished
 that much bett
er than warfare.
 If the aim was 
the progress of 
"civilization,
i"
t is easy to see
 that there are 
other ways of di
ffusing civiliza
tion more exped
ient than by the
 destruction of 
wealth and of hu
man lives.  Wh
y did it happen 
in this and not 
in some other wa
y?  Because it
 happened so! �
�Chance created 
the situation; g
enius utilized 
"it,” says hist"
ory.  But what
 is chance? What
 is genius?  T
he words chance 
and genius do no
t denote any rea
lly existing thi
ng and therefor
e cannot be defi
ned. Those words
 only denote a c
ertain stage of 
 understanding o
f phenomena. I d
o not know why a
 certain event o
ccurs; I think 
that I cannot kn
ow it; so I do n
ot try to know i
t and I talk abo
ut chance. I se
e a force produc
ing effects beyo
nd the scope of 
ordinary human 
agencies; I do n
ot understand wh
y this occurs an
d I talk of gen
ius.  To a her
"d of rams, the r"
am the herdsman 
drives each even
ing into a spec
ial enclosure to
 feed and that b
ecomes twice as 
fat as the other
s must seem to 
be a genius. And
 it must appear 
an astonishing c
onjunction of g
enius with a who
le series of ext
raordinary chanc
es that this ram
",
who instead o"
f getting into t
he general fold 
every evening go
es into a speci
al enclosure whe
re there are oat
s—that this ve
"ry ram, swelling"
" with
fat, is k"
illed for meat. 
  But the rams 
need only cease 
to suppose that 
all that happens
 to them happen
s solely for the
 attainment of t
heir sheepish ai
ms; they need on
ly admit that w
hat happens to t
hem may also hav
e purposes beyon
"d their ken,
an"
d they will at o
nce perceive a u
nity and coheren
ce in what happe
ned to the ram 
that was fattene
d. Even if they 
do not know for 
what purpose th
"ey are fattened,"
 they will at le
ast know that al
l that happened 
to the ram did 
not happen accid
"entally, and wil"
l no longer need
 the conceptions
 of chance or g
enius.  Only b
y renouncing our
 claim to discer
n a purpose imme
diately intelli
"gible to us, and"
 admitting the u
ltimate purpose 
to be beyond our
"
ken, may we di"
scern the sequen
ce of experience
s in the lives o
f historic char
acters and perce
ive the cause of
 the effect they
 produce (incom
mensurable with 
ordinary human c
"apabilities), an"
d then the words
 chance and gen
ius become super
fluous.  We ne
ed only confess 
that we do not k
now the purpose 
of the European 
 convulsions and
 that we know on
ly the facts—t
"hat is, the murd"
"ers, first
in F"
"rance, then in I"
"taly, in Africa,"
" in Prussia, in "
"Austria, in Spai"
"n,
and in Russi"
a—and that the
 movements from 
the west to the 
east and from t
he east to the w
est form the ess
ence and purpose
 of these events
", and
not only "
shall we have no
 need to see exc
eptional ability
 and genius in 
Napoleon and Ale
"xander, but we s"
hall be unable t
o consider them 
to be anything 
but like other m
"en, and we shall"
 not be obliged 
to have recours
e to chance for 
an explanation o
f those small ev
ents which made 
 these people wh
"at they were, bu"
t it will be cle
ar that all thos
e small events 
were inevitable.
  By discardin
g a claim to kno
wledge of the ul
"timate purpose, "
we shall clearl
y perceive that 
just as one cann
ot imagine a blo
ssom or seed for
 any single pla
nt better suited
 to it than thos
"e it produces, s"
o it is impossi
ble to imagine a
ny two people mo
re completely ad
apted down to th
e smallest deta
il for the purpo
se they had to f
"ulfill, than Nap"
oleon and Alexa
nder with all th
eir antecedents.
      CHAP
TER III  The f
undamental and e
ssential signifi
cance of the Eur
opean events of 
the beginning o
f the nineteenth
 century lies in
 the movement of
 the mass of th
e European peopl
es from west to 
east and afterwa
rds from east to
 west. The comm
encement of that
 movement was th
e movement from 
west to east. F
or the peoples o
f the west to be
 able to make th
eir warlike move
ment to Moscow 
it was necessary
: (1) that they 
should form them
selves into a m
ilitary group of
 a size able to 
endure a collisi
on with the warl
ike military gr
"oup of the east,"
 (2) that they s
hould abandon al
l established t
raditions and cu
"stoms, and (3) t"
hat during their
 military moveme
nt they should 
have at their he
ad a man who cou
ld justify to hi
mself and to the
m the deception
"s, robberies, an"
d murders which 
would have to be
 committed duri
ng that movement
.  And beginni
ng with the Fren
ch Revolution th
e old inadequate
ly large group 
"was destroyed, a"
s well as the ol
d habits and tra
"ditions, and ste"
p by step a gro
up was formed of
 larger dimensio
ns with new cust
oms and traditi
"ons, and a man w"
as produced who 
would stand at t
he head of the 
coming movement 
and bear the res
ponsibility for 
all that had to 
be done.  A ma
n without convic
"tions, without h"
"abits, without t"
"raditions, witho"
"ut
a name, and "
not even a Frenc
"hman, emerges—"
by what seem the
 strangest chan
ces—from among
 all the seethin
g French parties
", and without jo"
ining any one o
f them is borne 
forward to a pro
minent position.
  The ignoranc
e of his colleag
"ues, the weaknes"
s and insignific
ance of his opp
"onents, the fran"
kness of his fal
"sehoods, and the"
 dazzling and s
elf-confident li
mitations of thi
s man raise him 
to the head of t
he army. The br
illiant qualitie

childish audacit
y and self-conf

 Innumerable so-
called chances

h he falls with 
the rulers of F
rance turns to h
is advantage. Hi
s attempts to av
oid his predest
ined path are un
successful: he i
s not received i
nto the Russian 
"
service, and th"
e appointment he
 seeks in Turkey
 comes to nothin
g. During the w
ar in Italy he i
s several times 
on the verge of 
destruction and 
 each time is sa
ved in an unexpe
cted manner. Owi
ng to various di
plomatic consid
erations the Rus
sian armies—ju
st those which m
ight have destro
yed his prestig
e—do not appea
r upon the scene
 till he is no l
onger there.  
On his return fr
om Italy he find
s the government
 in Paris in a p
rocess of disso
lution in which 
all those who ar
e in it are inev
itably wiped ou
t and destroyed.
 And by chance a
n escape from th
is dangerous pos
ition presents 
itself in the fo
rm of an aimless
 and senseless e
xpedition to Af
rica. Again so-c
alled chance acc
ompanies him. Im
pregnable Malta 
 surrenders with
out a shot; his 
most reckless sc
hemes are crowne
d with success.
 The enemy’s f
"leet, which subs"
equently did not
 let a single bo
"at
pass, allows"
 his entire army
 to elude it. In
 Africa a whole 
series of outra
ges are committe
d against the al
most unarmed inh
abitants. And th
e men who commi
"t these crimes, "
especially their
" leader, assure "
themselves that
 this is admirab
"le, this is glor"
y—it resembles
 Caesar and Alex
ander the Great
 and is therefor
e good.  This 
ideal of glory a
nd grandeur—wh
ich consists not
 merely in cons
idering nothing 
wrong that one d
oes but in pridi
ng oneself on ev
ery crime one c
"ommits, ascribin"
g to it an incom
prehensible supe
rnatural signif
icance—that id
"eal, destined to"
 guide this man 
and his associat
"es,
had scope f"
or its developme
nt in Africa. Wh
atever he does s
ucceeds. The pl
ague does not to
uch him. The cru
elty of murderin
g prisoners is n
ot imputed to h
im as a fault. H
is childishly ra
"sh, uncalled-for"
", and
ignoble d"
eparture from Af
"rica, leaving hi"
s comrades in di
"stress, is
set "
down to his cred
"it, and again th"
e enemy’s flee
t twice lets him
 slip past. Whe
"n, intoxicated b"
y the crimes he 
has committed so
" successfully,
"
he reaches Paris
", the dissolutio"
n of the republi
"can government, "
which a year ea
rlier might have
" ruined him, has"
 reached its ext
"reme limit, and"
 his presence th
ere now as a new
comer free from 
party entangleme
nts can only se
rve to exalt him
—and though he
 himself has no 
"plan, he is quit"
e ready for his
 new rôle.  H
"e had no plan, h"
e was afraid of 
"everything, but "
the parties snat
ched at him and
 demanded his pa
rticipation.  
He alone—with 
his ideal of glo
ry and grandeur 
developed in Ita
"ly and
Egypt, h"
is insane self-a
"dulation, his bo"
ldness in crime 
and frankness in
 lying—he alo
ne could justify
 what had to be 
done.  He is n
eeded for the pl
ace that awaits 
"him, and so almo"
st apart from h
is will and desp
ite his indecisi
"on, his lack of "
"a plan, and all "
"his
mistakes, h"
e is drawn into 
a conspiracy tha
t aims at seizin
g power and the
 conspiracy is c
rowned with succ
ess.  He is pu
shed into a meet
ing of the legis
lature. In alarm
 he wishes to f
"lee, considering"
 himself lost. H
e pretends to fa
ll into a swoon 
and says sensel
ess things that 
should have ruin
ed him. But the 
once proud and 
shrewd rulers of
" France, feeling"
 that their part
" is played out, "
are even more b
ewildered than h
"e, and do not sa"
y the words they
 should have sa
id to destroy hi
m and retain the
ir power.  Cha
"nce, millions of"
" chances, give h"
"im power, and al"
l men as if by 
agreement co-ope
rate to confirm 
that power. Chan
ce forms the cha
racters of the 
rulers of France
", who submit to "
him; chance form
s the character 
 of Paul I of Ru
ssia who recogni
zes his governme
nt; chance contr
ives a plot aga
inst him which n
ot only fails to
 harm him but co
nfirms his powe
r. Chance puts t
he Duc d’Enghi
en in his hands 
and unexpectedly
 causes him to 
kill him—there
by convincing th
e mob more forci
bly than in any
 other way that 
he had the right
", since he had t"
he might. Chanc
e contrives that
 though he direc
ts all his effor
ts to prepare an
 expedition aga
inst England (wh
ich would inevit
ably have ruined
 him) he never 
carries out that
" intention, but "
unexpectedly fal
ls upon Mack and
"
the Austrians,"
 who surrender w
ithout a battle.
 Chance and geni
us give him the
 victory at Aust
erlitz; and by c
"hance all men, n"
ot only the Fre
nch but all Euro
pe—except Engl
and which does n
ot take part in 
the events abou
t to happen—de
spite their form
er horror and de
testation of hi
"s crimes, now re"
cognize his auth
"ority, the title"
 he has given h
"imself, and his "
ideal of grandeu
"r and glory, whi"
ch seems excelle
nt and reasonab
le to them all. 
  As if measuri
ng themselves an
d preparing for 
the coming movem
"ent, the
wester"
n forces push to
ward the east se
veral times in 1
"805, 1806, 1807,"
"
and 1809, gain"
ing strength and
 growing. In 181
1 the group of p
eople that had 
formed in France
 unites into one
 group with the 
peoples of Centr
al Europe. The 
strength of the 
justification of
 the man who sta
nds at the head
 of the movement
 grows with the 
increased size o
f the group. Dur
ing the ten-yea
r preparatory pe
riod this man ha
d formed relatio
ns with all the
 crowned heads o
f Europe. The di
scredited rulers
 of the world ca
n oppose no rea
sonable ideal to
 the insensate N
apoleonic ideal 
of glory and gr
andeur. One afte
r another they h
asten to display
 their insignif
icance before hi
m. The King of P
russia sends his
 wife to seek t
he great man’s
 mercy; the Empe
ror of Austria c
onsiders it a fa
vor that this m
an receives a da
ughter of the Ca
esars into his b
"ed; the Pope, th"
e guardian of a
ll that the nati
"ons hold sacred,"
 utilizes religi
on for the aggr
andizement of th
e great man. It 
is not Napoleon 
who prepares him
self for the ac
complishment of 
"his role, so muc"
h as all those r
ound him who pr
epare him to tak
e on himself the
 whole responsib
ility for what i
s happening and
 has to happen. 
There is no step
", no crime or pe"
tty fraud he co
"mmits, which in "
the mouths of th
ose around him i
s not at once r
epresented as a 
great deed. The 
most suitable f�
�te the Germans 
can devise for 
him is a celebra
tion of Jena and
 Auerstädt. Not
 only is he gre
"at, but so are h"
"is ancestors, hi"
"s brothers, his "
"stepsons, and hi"
s brothers-in-l
aw. Everything i
s done to depriv
e him of the rem
ains of his rea
son and to prepa
re him for his t
errible part. An
d when he is rea
dy so too are t
he forces.  Th
e invasion pushe
s eastward and r
eaches its final
 goal—Moscow. 
That city is ta
ken; the Russian
 army suffers he
avier losses tha
n the opposing 
armies had suffe
red in the forme
r war from Auste
rlitz to Wagram.
 But suddenly i
nstead of those 
chances and that
 genius which hi
therto had so c
onsistently led 
him by an uninte
rrupted series o
f successes to t
he predestined 
"goal, an innumer"
able sequence of
 inverse chances
 occur—from t
he cold in his h
ead at Borodinó
 to the sparks w
hich set Moscow 
"on
fire, and th"
e frosts—and i
nstead of genius
", stupidity and "
immeasurable ba
seness become ev
ident.  The in
"vaders flee, tur"
"n back, flee aga"
"in, and all the "
chances are now 
 not for Napoleo
n but always aga
inst him.  A c
ountermovement i
s then accomplis
hed from east to
 west with a re
markable resembl
ance to the prec
eding movement f
rom west to east
. Attempted dri
ves from east to
 west—similar 
to the contrary 
movements of 18
"05, 1807, and 18"
09—precede the
 great westward 
movement; there 
is the same coa
lescence into a 
group of enormou
s dimensions; th
e same adhesion 
 of the people o
f Central Europe
 to the movement
; the same hesit
"ation
midway, a"
nd the same incr
easing rapidity 
as the goal is a
pproached.  Pa
"ris, the ultimat"
"e goal, is reach"
ed. The Napoleon
ic government an
d army are dest
royed. Napoleon 
himself is no lo
nger of any acco
unt; all his ac
tions are eviden
tly pitiful and 
"mean, but again "
an inexplicable 
chance occurs. 
The allies detes
t Napoleon whom 
they regard as t
he cause of the
ir sufferings. D
eprived of power
" and authority, "
his crimes and h
is craft expose
"d, he should hav"
e appeared to th
em what he appea
red ten years p
reviously and on
e year later—a
n outlawed briga
nd. But by some 
 strange chance 
no one perceives
 this. His part 
is not yet ended
. The man who t
en years before 
and a year later
 was considered 
an outlawed brig
and is sent to 
an island two da
ys’ sail from 
"France, which fo"
r some reason i
s presented to h
im as his domini
"on, and guards a"
re given to him 
and millions of
 money are paid 
him.      
CHAPTER IV  Th
e flood of natio
ns begins to sub
side into its no
rmal channels. T
he waves of the
 great movement 
"abate, and on th"
e calm surface e
ddies are forme
d in which float
 the diplomatist
"s, who imagine t"
hat they have c
aused the floods
 to abate.  Bu
t the smooth sea
 again suddenly 
becomes disturbe
d. The diplomati
sts think that 
their disagreeme
nts are the caus
e of this fresh 
pressure of nat
ural forces; the
y anticipate war
 between their s
overeigns; the 
position seems t
o them insoluble
. But the wave t
hey feel to be r
ising does not 
come from the qu
arter they expec
t. It rises agai
n from the same 
 point as before
—Paris. The la
st backwash of t
he movement from
 the west occur
s: a backwash wh
ich serves to so
lve the apparent
ly insuperable 
diplomatic diffi
culties and ends
 the military mo
vement of that p
eriod of histor
y.  The man wh
o had devastated
 France returns 
"to France alone,"
 without any co
nspiracy and wit
hout soldiers. A
ny guard might a
"rrest him, but b"
y strange chanc
e no one does so
 and all rapturo
usly greet the m
an they cursed 
the day before a
nd will curse ag
ain a month late
r.  This man i
s still needed t
o justify the fi
nal collective a
ct.  That act 
is performed.  
 The last rôle 
is played. The a
ctor is bidden t
o disrobe and wa
sh off his powd
er and paint: he
 will not be wan
ted any more.  
 And some years 
pass during whic
h he plays a pit
iful comedy to h
imself in solit
ude on his islan
"d, justifying hi"
s actions by int
rigues and lies 
 when the justif
ication is no lo
"nger needed, and"
 displaying to t
he whole world 
what it was that
 people had mist
aken for strengt
h as long as an 
 unseen hand dir
ected his action
s.  The manage
r having brought
 the drama to a 
close and stripp
ed the actor sh
ows him to us. 
 “See what yo
u believed in! T
his is he! Do yo
u now see that i
t was not he bu
t I who moved yo
u?”  But daz
ed by the force 
"of the movement,"
 it was long bef
ore people unde
rstood this.  
Still greater co
herence and inev
itability is see
n in the life of
"
Alexander I, t"
he man who stood
 at the head of 
the countermovem
ent from east t
o west.  What 
was needed for h
"im who, overshad"
"owing others, st"
ood at the head 
of that movemen
t from east to w
est?  What was
 needed was a se
nse of justice a
nd a sympathy wi
th European aff
"airs, but a remo"
te sympathy not 
dulled by petty 
interests; a mor
al superiority 
over those sover
eigns of the day
 who co-operated
 with him; a mi
ld and attractiv
e personality; a
nd a personal gr
ievance against 
 Napoleon. And a
ll this was foun
d in Alexander I
; all this had b
een prepared by
 innumerable so-
called chances i
n his life: his 
"education,
his "
early liberalism
", the advisers w"
ho surrounded hi
"m, and by
Auste"
"rlitz, and Tilsi"
"t, and Erfurt.
"
 During the nat
ional war he was
 inactive becaus
e he was not nee
ded. But as soo
n as the necessi
ty for a general
 European war pr
esented itself h
e appeared in h
is place at the 
given moment and
", uniting the na"
tions of Europe
", led them to th"
e goal.  The g
oal is reached. 
After the final 
war of 1815 Alex
ander possesses 
all possible po
wer. How does he
 use it?  Alex
ander I—the pa
cifier of Europe
", the man who fr"
om his early yea
rs had striven 
only for his peo
"ple’s welfare,"
 the originator 
of the liberal 
innovations in h
is fatherland—
now that he seem
ed to possess th
e utmost power 
and therefore to
 have the possib
ility of bringin
g about the wel
fare of his peop
les—at the tim
e when Napoleon 
in exile was dra
wing up childis
h and mendacious
 plans of how he
 would have made
 mankind happy 
had he retained 
power—Alexande
"r I, having fulf"
illed his missio
n and feeling t
he hand of God u
"pon him, suddenl"
y recognizes the
 insignificance 
 of that suppose
"d power, turns a"
"way from it, and"
 gives it into t
he hands of con
temptible men wh
"om he despises, "
saying only:  
"“Not unto us, "
"not unto us, but"
 unto Thy Name!.
.. I too am a ma
n like the rest
 of you. Let me 
live like a man 
and think of my 
soul and of God.
”  As the su
n and each atom 
of ether is a sp
here complete in
" itself, and
ye"
t at the same ti
me only a part o
f a whole too im
mense for man to
"
comprehend, so"
 each individual
 has within hims
elf his own aims
 and yet has th
em to serve a ge
neral purpose in
comprehensible t
o man.  A bee 
settling on a fl
ower has stung a
 child. And the 
child is afraid 
 of bees and dec
lares that bees 
exist to sting p
eople. A poet ad
mires the bee s
ucking from the 
chalice of a flo
wer and says it 
exists to suck t
he fragrance of
 flowers. A beek
"eeper, seeing th"
e bee collect po
llen from flowe
rs and carry it 
"to the hive, say"
s that it exists
 to gather honey
. Another beeke
eper who has stu
died the life of
 the hive more c
losely says tha
t the bee gather
s pollen dust to
 feed the young 
bees and rear a
" queen, and that"
 it exists to pe
rpetuate its rac
e. A botanist no
tices that the 
bee flying with 
the pollen of a 
male flower to a
 pistil fertili
"zes the latter, "
and sees in this
 the purpose of 
the bee’s exi
"stence. Another,"
 observing the m
igration of plan
"ts, notices that"
 the bee helps 
"in this work, an"
d may say that i
n this lies the 
purpose of the 
bee. But the ult
imate purpose of
 the bee is not 
exhausted by the
" first,
the sec"
"ond, or any of t"
he processes the
 human mind can 
discern. The hi
gher the human i
ntellect rises i
n the discovery 
of these purpose
"s,
the more obv"
"ious it becomes,"
 that the ultima
te purpose is be
yond our compre
hension.  All 
that is accessib
le to man is the
 relation of the
 life of the bee
 to other manif
estations of lif
e. And so it is 
with the purpose
 of historic ch
aracters and nat
ions.      
 CHAPTER V  Na
tásha’s weddi
"ng to Bezúkhov,"
 which took plac
"e in 1813, was t"
he last happy e
vent in the fami
ly of the old Ro
stóvs. Count Il
yá Rostóv died
 that same year
" and, as always "
"happens, after t"
he father’s de
ath the family 
group broke up. 
  The events of
 the previous ye
ar: the burning 
of Moscow and th
e flight from i
"t, the death of "
"Prince Andrew, N"
atásha’s desp
"air, Pétya’s "
"death,
and the "
old countess’ 
grief fell blow 
after blow on th
e old count’s 
 head. He seemed
 to be unable to
 understand the 
meaning of all t
"hese
events, an"
d bowed his old 
head in a spirit
ual sense as if 
expecting and i
nviting further 
blows which woul
d finish him. He
 seemed now frig
htened and dist
raught and now u
nnaturally anima
ted and enterpri
sing.  The arr
angements for Na
tásha’s marri
age occupied him
 for a while. He
 ordered dinner
s and suppers an
d obviously trie
d to appear chee
"rful, but
his c"
heerfulness was 
not infectious a
s it used to be:
 on the contrary
 it evoked the 
compassion of th
ose who knew and
 liked him.  W
hen Pierre and h
is wife had left
", he grew very q"
uiet and began t
o complain of d
epression. A few
 days later he f
ell ill and took
 to his bed. He
 realized from t
he first that he
 would not get u
"p again, despite"
 the doctor’s
 encouragement. 
The countess pas
sed a fortnight 
in an armchair 
by his pillow wi
thout undressing
. Every time she
 gave him his m
edicine he sobbe
d and silently k
issed her hand. 
"On his last day,"
"
sobbing, he as"
ked her and his 
absent son to fo
rgive him for ha
ving dissipated
 their property�
��that being the
 chief fault of 
which he was co
nscious. After r
eceiving communi
on and unction h
e quietly died; 
and next day a 
throng of acquai
ntances who came
 to pay their la
st respects to 
the deceased fil
led the house re
nted by the Rost
óvs. All these 
"
acquaintances, "
who had so often
 dined and dance
d at his house a
nd had so often
" laughed at him,"
" now said, with "
a common feeling
 of self-reproac
"h
and emotion, "
as if justifying
 themselves: “
"Well, whatever h"
e may have been
 he was a most w
orthy man. You d
on’t meet such
 men nowadays...
. And which of 
us has not weakn
esses of his own
?”  It was j
ust when the cou
nt’s affairs h
ad become so inv
olved that it wa
s impossible to
 say what would 
happen if he liv
ed another year 
that he unexpec
tedly died.  N
icholas was with
 the Russian arm
y in Paris when 
the news of his 
 father’s deat
h reached him. H
e at once resign
ed his commissio
"n, and
without "
waiting for it t
o be accepted to
ok leave of abse
nce and went to 
 Moscow. The sta
te of the count�
��s affairs beca
me quite obvious
 a month after 
"his death, surpr"
ising everyone b
y the immense to
tal of small de
bts the existenc
e of which no on
e had suspected.
 The debts amoun
ted to double t
he value of the 
property.  Fri
ends and relatio
ns advised Nicho
las to decline t
he inheritance. 
But he regarded
 such a refusal 
as a slur on his
 father’s memo
"ry, which he
he"
"ld sacred, and t"
herefore would n
ot hear of refus
ing and accepted
 the inheritanc
e together with 
the obligation t
o pay the debts.
  The creditor
s who had so lon
"g been silent, r"
estrained by a v
ague but powerf
ul influence exe
rted on them whi
le he lived by t
he count’s ca
reless good natu
"re, all proceede"

ir claims at onc

ppens in such ca
ses rivalry spra
ng up as to whic
h should get pa
"id first, and th"
ose who like Mí
tenka held promi
ssory notes give
n them as prese
nts now became t
he most exacting
 of the creditor
s. Nicholas was 
 allowed no resp
ite and no peace
", and those who "
had seemed to pi
ty the old man�
��the cause of t
heir losses (if 
they were losses
)—now remorse
lessly pursued t
he young heir wh
o had voluntaril
y undertaken the
 debts and was 
obviously not gu
ilty of contract
ing them.  Not
 one of the plan
s Nicholas tried
 succeeded; the 
estate was sold 
by auction for 
"half its value, "
and half the deb
ts still remaine
d unpaid. Nicho
las accepted thi
rty thousand rub
les offered him 
by his brother-
in-law Bezúkhov
 to pay off debt
s he regarded as
 genuinely due 
for value receiv
ed. And to avoid
 being imprisone
d for the remain
"der, as
the cre"
ditors threatene
"d, he re-entered"
 the government 
service.  He c
ould not rejoin 
the army where h
e would have bee
n made colonel a
t the next vaca
"ncy, for his mot"
her now clung to
 him as her one 
hold on life; a
nd so despite hi
s reluctance to 
remain in Moscow
 among people wh
o had known him
" before, and des"
pite his abhorre
nce of the civil
" service,
he ac"
cepted a post in
 Moscow in that 
"service, doffed "
the uniform of 
which he was so 
"fond, and moved "
with his mother 
and Sónya to a 
small house on 
the Sívtsev Vra
zhók.  Natás
ha and Pierre we
re living in Pet
ersburg at the t
ime and had no 
clear idea of Ni
cholas’ circum
stances. Having 
borrowed money f
rom his brother
"-in-law, Nichola"
s tried to hide 
his wretched con
dition from him.
 His position w
as the more diff
icult because wi
th his salary of
 twelve hundred
 rubles he had n
ot only to keep 
"himself, his mot"
"her, and Sónya,"
 but had to shi
eld his mother f
rom knowledge of
 their poverty. 
The countess co
uld not conceive
 of life without
 the luxurious c
onditions she h
ad been used to 
from childhood a
"nd, unable to re"
alize how hard i
t was for her s
"on, kept demandi"
ng now a carriag

up with her whi

ed Nicholas to c

holas felt himse
lf irredeemably 
indebted to Só
nya for all she 
was doing for hi
s mother and gre
atly admired her
 patience and d
"evotion, but tri"
ed to keep aloof
 from her.  He
 seemed in his h
eart to reproach
 her for being t
"oo perfect, and"
 because there w
as nothing to re
proach her with.
 She had all tha
t people are va
"lued for, but li"
ttle that could 
have made him lo
ve her. He felt 
 that the more h
e valued her the
 less he loved h
er. He had taken
 her at her wor
d when she wrote
 giving him his 
freedom and now 
behaved as if al
l that had pass
ed between them 
had been long fo
rgotten and coul
d never in any 
case be renewed.
  Nicholas’ 
position became 
worse and worse.
 The idea of put
ting something 
aside out of his
 salary proved a
 dream. Not only
 did he not save
"
anything, but "
to comply with h
is mother’s de
mands he even in
curred some sma
ll debts. He cou
ld see no way ou
t of this situat
ion. The idea of
 marrying some 
"rich woman, whic"
h was suggested 
to him by his fe
"male
relations,"
 was repugnant t
o him. The other
 way out—his m
other’s death
—never entered
 his head. He wi
shed for nothing
 and hoped for 
"nothing, and dee"
p in his heart e
xperienced a glo
omy and stern s
atisfaction in a
n uncomplaining 
endurance of his
 position. He tr
ied to avoid hi
s old acquaintan
ces with their c
ommiseration and
 offensive offe
rs of assistance
; he avoided all
 distraction and
" recreation, and"
 even at home d
id nothing but p
lay cards with h
"is mother, pace "
silently up and
" down the room, "
and smoke one pi
pe after another
. He seemed car
efully to cheris
h within himself
 the gloomy mood
 which alone ena
bled him to end
ure his position
.      CHA
PTER VI  At th
e beginning of w
inter Princess M
ary came to Mosc
ow. From reports
 current in tow
n she learned ho
w the Rostóvs w
"ere situated, an"
d how “the so
n has sacrificed
 himself for his
" mother,” as p"
eople were sayin
g.  “I never
 expected anythi
"ng else of him,�"
�� said Princess
 Mary to herself
",
feeling a joy"
ous sense of her
 love for him. R
emembering her f
riendly relatio
ns with all the 
Rostóvs which h
ad made her almo
st a member of t
"he
family, she "
thought it her d
uty to go to see
 them. But remem
bering her rela
tions with Nicho
las in Vorónezh
 she was shy abo
ut doing so. Mak
ing a great eff
ort she did howe
ver go to call o
n them a few wee
ks after her ar
rival in Moscow.
  Nicholas was
 the first to me
"et her, as the c"
ountess’ room 
could only be r
eached through h
is. But instead 
of being greeted
 with pleasure a
s she had expec
"ted, at his firs"
t glance at her 
his face assumed
" a cold, stiff,"
 proud expressio
n she had not se
en on it before.
 He inquired abo
"ut her
health, "
led the way to h
"is mother, and h"
aving sat there 
for five minutes
 left the room.
  When the pri
ncess came out o
f the countess�
� room Nicholas 
"met her again,
"
and with marked 
solemnity and st
iffness accompan
ied her to the a
nteroom. To her
 remarks about h
is mother’s he
alth he made no 
reply. “What�
�s that to you?
 Leave me in pea
"ce,” his looks"
 seemed to say. 
  “Why does s
he come prowling
 here? What does
 she want? I can
’t bear these 
 ladies and all 
these civilities
!” said he alo
ud in Sónya’s
" presence,
evid"
ently unable to 
repress his vexa
"tion, after the "
princess’ carr
iage had disapp
"eared.

“Oh,"
" Nicholas, how c"
an you talk like
 that?” cried 
"Sónya, hardly a"
ble to conceal 
her delight. “
She is so kind a
nd Mamma is so f
ond of her!” 
 Nicholas did n
ot reply and tri
ed to avoid spea
king of the prin
cess any more. 
But after her vi
sit the old coun
tess spoke of he
r several times 
a day.  She s
"ang her praises,"
 insisted that h
er son must call
" on her, express"
ed a wish to se
"e her often, but"
 yet always beca
me ill-humored w
hen she began t
o talk about her
.  Nicholas tr
ied to keep sile
nce when his mot
her spoke of the
" princess,
but "
his silence irri
tated her.  �
�She is a very a
dmirable and exc
ellent young wom
"an,” said she,"
 “and you mus
t go and call on
 her. You would 
at least be seei
"ng somebody, and"
 I think it mus
t be dull for yo
u only seeing us
.”  “But I
 don’t in the 
"least want to, M"
amma.”  “Y
ou used to want 
"to, and now you "
don’t. Really 
I don’t unders
"tand you,
my de"
ar. One day you 
"are dull, and th"
e next you refus
e to see anyone.
”  “But I 
never said I was
 dull.”  “
"Why, you said yo"
urself you don�
�t want even to 
see her. She is 
a very admirabl
e young woman an
d you always lik
"ed her, but now "
suddenly you ha
ve got some noti
on or other in y
our head. You hi
de everything fr
om me.”  �
"�Not at all, Mam"
ma.”  “If 
I were asking yo
u to do somethin
g disagreeable n
ow—but I only 
ask you to retu
rn a call. One w
ould think mere 
politeness requi
red it.... Well
", I have asked y"
"ou, and now I wo"
n’t interfere 
any more since y
ou have secrets
 from your mothe
r.”  “Well
", then, I’ll g"
o if you wish it
.”  “It do
esn’t matter t
o me. I only wis
h it for your sa
ke.”  Nichol
"as sighed, bit h"
"is mustache, and"
 laid out the ca
rds for a patie
"nce, trying to d"
ivert his mother
’s attention t
o another topic.
  The same con
versation was re
peated next day 
and the day afte
"r, and the
day "
after that.  A
fter her visit t
o the Rostóvs a
nd her unexpecte
dly chilly recep
tion by Nichola
"s, Princess Mary"
 confessed to he
rself that she h
ad been right in
 not wishing to
 be the first to
 call.  “I e
xpected nothing 
"else,” she tol"
"d herself, calli"
ng her pride to 
her aid. “I h
ave nothing to d
o with him and I
 only wanted to 
see the old lad
"y, who was alway"
s kind to me and
 to whom I am un
der many obliga
tions.”  But
 she could not p
acify herself wi
th these reflect
ions; a feeling 
akin to remorse
 troubled her wh
en she thought o
f her visit. Tho
ugh she had fir
mly resolved not
 to call on the 
Rostóvs again a
nd to forget the
" whole
matter, "
she felt herself
 all the time in
 an awkward posi
tion. And when 
she asked hersel
f what distresse
"d her, she had t"
o admit that it 
was her relatio
n to Rostóv. Hi
"s cold, polite m"
anner did not ex
press his feelin
g for her (she 
knew that) but i
t concealed some
"thing, and until"
 she could disc
over what that s
"omething was, sh"
e felt that she 
could not be at 
 ease.  One da
y in midwinter w
hen sitting in t
he schoolroom at
tending to her 
nephew’s lesso
"ns, she was info"
rmed that Rostó
v had called. Wi
th a firm resol
ution not to bet
ray herself and 
not show her agi
"tation, she sent"
 for Mademoisel
le Bourienne and
 went with her t
o the drawing ro
om.  Her first
 glance at Nicho
las’ face told
 her that he had
 only come to f
ulfill the deman
ds of politeness
", and she firmly"
 resolved to mai
ntain the tone 
in which he addr
essed her.  Th
ey spoke of the 
countess’ heal
"th, of their mut"
"ual friends, of "
the latest war 
"news, and when t"
he ten minutes r
equired by propr
iety had elapse
d after which a 
visitor may rise
", Nicholas got u"
p to say good-by
.  With Mademo
iselle Bourienne
’s help the pr
incess had maint
ained the conve
rsation very wel
"l, but at the ve"
"ry last moment, "
just when he ros
"e,
she was so t"
ired of talking 
of what did not 
"interest her, an"
d her mind was 
so full of the q
uestion why she 
alone was grante
d so little hap
"piness in life, "
that in a fit of
 absent-mindedne
ss she sat still
", her
luminous "
eyes gazing fixe
"dly before her, "
not noticing tha
t he had risen. 
  Nicholas glan
"ced at her and, "
wishing to appea
r not to notice 
her abstraction
", made some rema"
rk to Mademoisel
le Bourienne and
 then again loo
ked at the princ
ess. She still s
at motionless wi
th a look of su
ffering on her g
entle face. He s
uddenly felt sor
ry for her and w
as vaguely cons
cious that he mi
ght be the cause
 of the sadness 
her face expres
sed. He wished t
o help her and s
ay something ple
"asant, but could"
 think of nothi
ng to say.  �
"�Good-by, Prince"
ss!” said he. 
"

She started, "
"flushed, and sig"
hed deeply.  �
"��Oh, I beg your"
" pardon,” she "
said as if wakin
g up. “Are you
" going
already,"
 Count? Well the
"n, good-by! Oh, "
but the cushion 
for the countes
s!”  “Wait
" a moment, I’l"
"l fetch it,” s"
aid Mademoiselle
" Bourienne, and "
she left the ro
om.  They both
" sat silent, wit"
h an occasional 
glance at one an
other.  “Yes
", Princess,” s"
aid Nicholas at 
last with a sad 
"smile, “it doe"
sn’t seem lon
g ago since we f
irst met at Bogu
"chárovo, but ho"
w much water ha
s flowed since t
hen! In what dis
tress we all see
"med to be then, "
yet I would giv
e much to bring 
back that time..
. but there’s 
no bringing it 
back.”  Prin
cess Mary gazed 
intently into hi
s eyes with her 
own luminous one
s as he said th
is. She seemed t
o be trying to f
athom the hidden
 meaning of his
 words which wou
ld explain his f
eeling for her. 
"

“Yes, yes,�"
"�� said she, “"
but you have no 
reason to regret
" the past, Count"
. As I understa
nd your present 
"life, I think yo"
u will always re
call it with sa
"tisfaction, beca"
use the self-sac
rifice that fill
s it now...” 
 “I cannot ac
cept your praise
",” he interrup"
ted her hurriedl
y. “On the co
ntrary I continu
ally reproach my
self.... But thi
s is not at all 
an interesting 
or cheerful subj
ect.”  His f
ace again resume
d its former sti
ff and cold expr
ession. But the 
 princess had ca
ught a glimpse o
f the man she ha
d known and love
"d, and it
was t"
o him that she n
ow spoke.  “
I thought you wo
uld allow me to 
"tell you this,�"
� she said. “I
 had come so ne
ar to you... and
 to all your fam
ily that I thoug
ht you would not
 consider my sy
mpathy misplaced
", but I was mist"
"aken,” and sud"
denly her voice
 trembled. “I 
don’t know why
",” she continu"
"ed, recovering h"
"erself,
“but "
you used to be d
"ifferent, and..."
”  “There 
are a thousand r
"easons why,” l"
aying special em
phasis on the wh
y. “Thank you
", Princess,” h"
e added softly. 
“Sometimes it 
is hard.”  �
��So that’s wh
y! That’s why!
” a voice whis
pered in Princes
s Mary’s soul.
"
“No, it was "
not only that ga
"y, kind, and fra"
"nk look, not onl"
y that handsome
" exterior, that "
I loved in him. 
I divined his no
"ble, resolute,
"
self-sacrificing
" spirit too,” "
she said to hers
"elf. “Yes, he "
is poor now and
 I am rich.... Y
"es, that’s the"
 only reason....
" Yes, were it no"
t for that...�
� And rememberin
g his former ten
"derness, and loo"
king now at his 
"
kind, sorrowful"
" face, she sudde"
nly understood t
he cause of his 
coldness.  “
"But why, Count, "
why?” she almo
"st cried, uncons"
ciously moving c
loser to him. �
��Why? Tell me. 
You must tell me
!”  He was s
ilent.  “I d
on’t understan
"d your why, Coun"
"t,” she contin"
"ued, “but it�"
�s hard for me.
.. I confess it.
 For some reason
 you wish to dep
rive me of our f
ormer friendshi
p. And that hurt
s me.” There w
ere tears in her
 eyes and in her
 voice. “I ha
ve had so little
 happiness in li
fe that every lo
ss is hard for 
me to bear.... E
"xcuse me, good-b"
y!” and sudden
ly she began to 
cry and was hur
rying from the r
oom.  “Princ
"ess, for God’s"
 sake!” he exc
"laimed, trying t"
o stop her. “
Princess!”  
She turned round
. For a few seco
nds they gazed s
ilently into one
 another’s ey
es—and what ha
d seemed impossi
ble and remote s
uddenly became 
"possible, inevit"
"able, and very n"
ear.      
CHAPTER VII  I
n the winter of 
1813 Nicholas ma
rried Princess M
ary and moved to
 Bald Hills wit
"h his wife, his "
"mother, and Són"
ya.  Within fo
ur years he had 
paid off all his
 remaining debts
 without sellin
g any of his wif
"e’s property, "
and having recei
ved a small inh
eritance on the 
death of a cousi
n he paid his de
bt to Pierre as 
well.  In anot
"her three years,"
" by 1820, he had"
 so managed his 
affairs that he 
 was able to buy
 a small estate 
adjoining Bald H
ills and was neg
otiating to buy
 back Otrádnoe�
��that being his
 pet dream.  H
aving started fa
rming from neces
"sity, he soon gr"
ew so devoted to
 it that it bec
ame his favorite
 and almost his 
sole occupation.
 Nicholas was a
 plain farmer: h
e did not like i
"nnovations, espe"
cially the Engli
sh ones then co
ming into vogue.
 He laughed at t
heoretical treat
ises on estate 
"management, disl"
"iked factories, "
the raising of e
xpensive product
"s,
and the buyi"
ng of expensive 
"seed corn, and d"
id not make a ho
bby of any part
icular part of t
he work on his e
state. He always
 had before his 
 mind’s eye th
e estate as a wh
ole and not any 
particular part 
of it. The chie
f thing in his e
yes was not the 
nitrogen in the 
"soil, nor the ox"
ygen in the air
", nor manures, n"
or special plows
", but that most "
important agent
 by which nitrog
"en, oxygen, manu"
"re, and plow wer"
e made effectiv
e—the peasant 
laborer. When Ni
cholas first beg
an farming and 
began to underst
and its differen
"t branches, it w"
as the serf who 
 especially attr
acted his attent
ion. The peasant
 seemed to him n
ot merely a too
"l, but also a ju"
dge of farming a
nd an end in him
self. At first 
he watched the s
"erfs, trying to "
understand their
 aims and what t
hey considered 
"good and bad, an"
d only pretended
 to direct them 
and give orders
 while in realit
y learning from 
them their metho
"ds, their manner"
"
of speech, and"
 their judgment 
of what was good
 and bad. Only w
hen he had unde
rstood the peasa
nts’ tastes an
"d aspirations, h"
ad learned to ta
lk their langua
"ge, to grasp the"
 hidden meaning 
"of their words, "
and felt akin t
o them did he be
gin boldly to ma
"nage his serfs, "
"that is, to
per"
form toward them
 the duties dema
nded of him. And
 Nicholas’ man
agement produce
d very brilliant
 results.  Gui
ded by some gift
" of insight, on "
taking up the ma
nagement of the 
 estates he at o
nce unerringly a
ppointed as bail
"iff, village eld"
"er, and
delegat"
"e, the very men "
the serfs would 
themselves have 
chosen had they 
 had the right t
"o choose, and th"
ese posts never 
changed hands. B
efore analyzing
 the properties 
"of manure, befor"
e entering into 
the debit and c
redit (as he iro
nically called i
"t), he found out"
 how many cattle
 the peasants h
ad and increased
 the number by a
ll possible mean
s. He kept the 
peasant families
 together in the
 largest groups 
"possible, not al"
lowing the fami
ly groups to div
ide into separat
e households. He
 was hard alike 
"
on the lazy, th"
"e depraved, and "
"the weak, and tr"
ied to get them 
expelled from t
he commune.  H
e was as careful
 of the sowing a
nd reaping of th
e peasants’ ha
y and corn as o
"f his own, and f"
ew landowners ha
d their crops so
wn and harveste
d so early and s
"o well, or got s"
"o good a return,"
 as did Nichola
s.  He dislike
d having anythin
g to do with the
 domestic serfs�
��the “drones�
�� as he called
 them—and ever
yone said he spo
iled them by his
 laxity. When a
 decision had to
 be taken regard
ing a domestic s
"erf, especially "
if one had to b
"e punished, he a"
lways felt undec
ided and consult
ed everybody in 
 the house; but 
when it was poss
ible to have a d
omestic serf con
scripted instea
d of a land work
er he did so wit
hout the least h
esitation. He n
ever felt any he
sitation in deal
ing with the pea
sants. He knew t
hat his every d
ecision would be
 approved by the
m all with very 
few exceptions. 
  He did not al
low himself eith
er to be hard on
 or punish a man
", or to
make th"
ings easy for or
" reward anyone, "
merely because h
e felt inclined 
 to do so. He co
uld not have sai
d by what standa
rd he judged wha
t he should or 
"should not do, b"
ut the standard 
was quite firm a
nd definite in 
his own mind.  
"
Often, speaking"
 with vexation o
f some failure o
"r irregularity, "
he would say: �
��What can one d
o with our Russi
an peasants?” 
and imagined tha
t he could not 
bear them.  Ye
t he loved “ou
r Russian peasan
ts” and their 
way of life with
 his whole soul
", and for that v"
ery reason had u
nderstood and as
similated the on
e way and manne
r of farming whi
ch produced good
 results.  Cou
ntess Mary was j
ealous of this p
assion of her hu
sband’s and re
gretted that sh
e could not shar
e it; but she co
uld not understa
nd the joys and 
 vexations he de
rived from that 
"world, to her so"
 remote and alie
n. She could no
t understand why
 he was so parti
cularly animated
 and happy when
", after getting "
up at daybreak a
nd spending the 
whole morning in
 the fields or 
on the threshing
" floor, he retur"
ned from the sow
ing or mowing o
r reaping to hav
e tea with her. 
She did not unde
rstand why he sp
oke with such a
dmiration and de
light of the far
ming of the thri
fty and well-to
-do peasant Matt
"hew Ermíshin, w"
ho with his fami
ly had carted c
orn all night; o
r of the fact th
at his (Nicholas
’) sheaves wer
e already stack
ed before anyone
 else had his ha
rvest in. She di
d not understand
 why he stepped
 out from the wi
ndow to the vera
nda and smiled u
nder his mustac
he and winked so
" joyfully, when "
warm steady rain
 began to fall 
on the dry and t
hirsty shoots of
" the young oats,"
 or why when the
 wind carried a
way a threatenin
g cloud during t
he hay harvest h
e would return 
"from the barn, f"
"lushed, sunburne"
"d, and perspirin"
"g, with a smell "
of wormwood and
 gentian in his 
"hair and, gleefu"
lly rubbing his 
"hands, would
sa"
"y: “Well, one "
more day and my 
grain and the pe
asants’ will a
ll be under cov
er.”  Still 
less did she und
"erstand why he, "
kindhearted and 
always ready to 
 anticipate her 
"wishes, should b"
ecome almost des
perate when she 
brought him a p
etition from som
e peasant men or
 women who had a
ppealed to her 
to be excused so
"me work; why he,"
 that kind Nicho
"las, should obst"
inately refuse 
"her, angrily ask"
ing her not to i
nterfere in what
 was not her bu
siness. She felt
 he had a world 
"apart, which he "
loved passionate
ly and which ha
d laws she had n
ot fathomed.  
"Sometimes when, "
trying to unders
"tand him, she sp"
oke of the good 
work he was doi
ng for his serfs
", he would be ve"
xed and reply: �
��Not in the lea
st; it never en
tered my head an
d I wouldn’t d
o that for their
 good! That’s 
 all poetry and 
old wives’ tal
k—all that doi
ng good to one�
�s neighbor! Wh
at I want is tha
t our children s
hould not have t
o go begging. I 
must put our af
fairs in order w
"hile I am alive,"
 that’s all. A
"nd to do that,
"
order and strict
ness are essenti
al.... That’s 
all about it!”
" said he,
clenc"
hing his vigorou
s fist. “And f
"airness, of cour"
"se,” he added,"
 “for if the 
peasant is naked
 and hungry and 
has only one mis
"erable horse, he"
 can do no good
 either for hims
elf or for me.�
�  And all Nic
holas did was fr
uitful—probabl
y just because h
e refused to al
low himself to t
hink that he was
 doing good to o
thers for virtue
’s sake. His 
means increased 
rapidly; serfs f
rom neighboring 
estates came to
 beg him to buy 
"them, and long a"
fter his death t
he memory of his
 administration
 was devoutly pr
eserved among th
e serfs. “He w
as a master... 
the peasants’ 
affairs first an
d then his own. 
Of course he was
 not to be trif
led with either�
"��in a word, he "
was a real maste
r!”      
 CHAPTER VIII  
 One matter conn
ected with his m
anagement someti
mes worried Nich
"olas, and
that "
was his quick te
mper together wi
th his old hussa
r habit of makin
g free use of h
is fists. At fir
st he saw nothin
g reprehensible 
"in
this, but in"
 the second year
 of his marriage
 his view of tha
t form of punis
hment suddenly c
hanged.  Once 
in summer he had
 sent for the vi
llage elder from
" Boguchárovo, a"
 man who had su
cceeded to the p
ost when Dron di
ed and who was a
ccused of disho
nesty and variou
s irregularities
. Nicholas went 
out into the por
ch to question 
"him, and immedia"
tely after the e
lder had given a
 few replies th
e sound of cries
 and blows were 
heard. On return
ing to lunch Nic
holas went up t
"o his wife, who "
sat with her hea
d bent low over 
her embroidery 
"frame, and as us"
ual began to tel
l her what he ha
d been doing tha
t morning. Amon
g other things h
e spoke of the B

r. Countess Mar
y turned red and
" then pale, but "
continued to sit
 with head bowed
 and lips compr
essed and gave h
er husband no re
ply.  “Such 
an insolent scou
ndrel!” he cri
"ed, growing hot "
again at the mer
e recollection 
of him. “If he
 had told me he 
was drunk and di
d not see... Bu
t what is the ma
"tter with you, M"
ary?” he sudde
nly asked.  Co
untess Mary rais
ed her head and 
"tried to speak, "
but hastily look
ed down again a
nd her lips puck
"ered.

“Why,"
 whatever is the
" matter, my dear"
est?”  The l
ooks of the plai
n Countess Mary 
always improved 
when she was in 
 tears. She neve
r cried from pai
"n or vexation, b"
ut always from s
"orrow or
pity, "
and when she wep
t her radiant ey
es acquired an i
rresistible char
m.  The moment
 Nicholas took h
er hand she coul
d no longer rest
rain herself an
d began to cry. 
"

“Nicholas, "
I saw it... he w
"as to blame, but"
 why do you... N
icholas!” and 
 she covered her
 face with her h
ands.  Nichola
s said nothing. 
He flushed crims
"on, left her sid"
"e, and paced up"
 and down the ro
om. He understoo
d what she was w
"eeping about, bu"
t could not in 
his heart at onc
e agree with her
 that what he ha
d regarded from
 childhood as qu
ite an everyday 
event was wrong.
 “Is it just 
"sentimentality, "
old wives’ tal
"es, or is she ri"
ght?” he asked
 himself. Befor
e he had solved 
that point he gl
anced again at h
er face filled w
ith love and pa
"in, and he sudde"
nly realized tha
t she was right 
and that he had
 long been sinni
ng against himse
"lf.

“Mary,�"
�� he said softl
"y, going up to h"
"er, “it will n"
ever happen agai
n; I give you m
"y word. Never,�"
� he repeated in
 a trembling voi
ce like a boy a
sking for forgiv
eness.  The te
ars flowed faste
r still from the
 countess’ eye
s. She took his 
hand and kissed
 it.  “Nicho
"las, when did yo"
u break your cam
eo?” she asked
 to change the 
"subject, looking"
 at his finger o
n which he wore 
a ring with a ca
meo of Laocoön
’s head.  �
�Today—it was 
the same affair.
" Oh, Mary, don�"
�t remind me of 
it!” and agai
n he flushed. �
�I give you my w
ord of honor it 
shan’t occur a
"gain,
and let t"
his always be a 
"reminder to me,�"
�� and he pointe
d to the broken 
 ring.  After 
"that, when in di"
scussions with h
is village elder
s or stewards th
e blood rushed 
to his face and 
his fists began 
"to clench, Nicho"
las would turn 
the broken ring 
on his finger an
d would drop his
 eyes before the
 man who was ma
king him angry. 
But he did forge
t himself once o
r twice within 
"a twelvemonth, a"
nd then he would
 go and confess 
"to his wife, and"
 would again pr
omise that this 
should really be
 the very last t
"ime.

“Mary,"
 you must despis
e me!” he woul
d say. “I dese
rve it.”  �
"�You should go, "
"go away at once,"
 if you don’t 
feel strong enou
gh to control y
"ourself,” she "
would reply sadl
"y, trying to com"
fort her husband
.  Among the g
entry of the pro
vince Nicholas w
as respected but
 not liked. He 
did not concern 
himself with the
 interests of hi
"s own class, and"
 consequently s
ome thought him 
proud and others
 thought him stu
pid. The whole 
"summer, from spr"
ing sowing to ha
"rvest, he was bu"
sy with the work
 on his farm. I
n autumn he gave
 himself up to h
unting with the 
same business-l
ike seriousness�
��leaving home f
"or a month, or e"
"ven two, with
h"
is hunt. In wint
er he visited hi
s other villages
 or spent his ti
me reading. The
 books he read w
ere chiefly hist
"orical, and on t"
hese he spent a
 certain sum eve
ry year. He was 
"collecting, as h"
"e said, a seriou"
"s
library, and "
he made it a rul
e to read throug
h all the books 
he bought. He w
ould sit in his 
study with a gra
"ve air, reading�"
��a task he firs
t imposed upon 
himself as a dut
"y, but which aft"
erwards became a
 habit affordin
g him a special 
kind of pleasure
 and a conscious
ness of being o
ccupied with ser
ious matters. In
" winter, except "
for business ex
"cursions, he spe"
nt most of his t
ime at home maki
ng himself one w
ith his family 
and entering int
o all the detail
s of his childre
n’s relations 
 with their moth
er. The harmony 
between him and 
his wife grew cl
oser and closer
 and he daily di
scovered fresh s
piritual treasur
es in her.  Fr
om the time of h
is marriage Són
ya had lived in 
his house. Befor
"e
that, Nichola"
s had told his w
ife all that had
 passed between 
himself and Só
"nya, blaming him"
self and commend
ing her. He had 
asked Princess M
ary to be gentl
e and kind to hi
s cousin. She th
oroughly realize
d the wrong he 
"had done Sónya,"
 felt herself to
 blame toward he
"r, and imagined "
that her wealth
 had influenced 
Nicholas’ choi
ce. She could no
t find fault wit
h Sónya in any
 way and tried t
o be fond of her
", but often felt"
 ill-will towar
d her which she 
could not overco
me.  Once she 
had a talk with 
her friend Natá
sha about Sónya
 and about her 
own injustice to
ward her.  “
"You know,” sai"
"d Natásha, “y"
ou have read the
 Gospels a great
 deal—there i
s a passage in t
hem that just fi
ts Sónya.”  
 “What?” ask
ed Countess Mary
", surprised.

"
“‘To him tha
t hath shall be 
"given, and from "
him that hath no
t shall be take
n away.’ You r
emember? She is 
one that hath no
"t; why, I don’"
t know. Perhaps
 she lacks egoti
"sm, I don’t kn"
"ow, but from her"
" is taken away, "
and everything 
has been taken a
way. Sometimes I
 am dreadfully s
orry for her. F
ormerly I very m
uch wanted Nicho
las to marry her
", but I always h"
ad a sort of pr
esentiment that 
it would not com
e off. She is a 
"sterile
flower,"
 you know—like
 some strawberry
 blossoms. Somet
imes I am sorry 
"for
her, and so"
metimes I think 
she doesn’t fe
el it as you or 
I would.”  T
hough Countess M
ary told Natásh
a that those wor
ds in the Gospel
 must be unders
tood differently
", yet looking at"
 Sónya she agre
ed with Natásha
’s explanatio
n. It really see
med that Sónya 
did not feel her
 position tryin
"g, and had grown"
 quite reconcile
d to her lot as 
a sterile flower
. She seemed to
 be fond not so 
much of individu
als as of the fa
mily as a whole
". Like a cat, sh"
e had attached h
erself not to th
e people but to 
the home. She w
aited on the old
" countess, pette"
d and spoiled th
"e children,
was"
 always ready to
 render the smal
l services for w
hich she had a g
"ift,
and all th"
is was unconscio
usly accepted fr
om her with insu
fficient gratit
ude.  The coun
try seat at Bald
 Hills had been 
"rebuilt, though "
not on the same 
 scale as under 
the old prince. 
  The buildings
", begun under st"
raitened circums
"tances, were mor"
e than simple. 
The immense hous
e on the old sto
ne foundations w
"as of wood,
pla"
stered only insi
de. It had bare 
deal floors and 
was furnished wi
th very simple 
"hard sofas, armc"
"hairs, tables, a"
nd chairs made b
y their own ser
f carpenters out
 of their own bi
rchwood. The hou
se was spacious 
 and had rooms f
or the house ser
fs and apartment
s for visitors. 
Whole families 
of the Rostóvs�
�� and Bolkónsk
is’ relations 
sometimes came t
o Bald Hills wi
th sixteen horse
s and dozens of 
servants and sta
yed for months.
" Besides that, f"
our times a year
", on the name da"
ys and birthdays
"
of the hosts, "
as many as a hun
dred visitors wo
uld gather there
 for a day or t
wo. The rest of 
the year life pu
rsued its unbrok
en routine with 
its ordinary oc
"cupations, and i"
"ts breakfasts, l"
"unches, dinners,"
" and suppers,
p"
rovided out of t

   CHAPTER IX 
  It was the ev
e of St. Nichola
"s, the fifth of "
"December, 1820. "
Natásha had be
en staying at he
r brother’s wi
th her husband a
nd children sinc
e early autumn.
 Pierre had gone
 to Petersburg o
n business of hi
s own for three 
 weeks as he sai
"d, but had remai"
ned there nearly
 seven weeks and
 was expected b
ack every minute
.  Besides the
 Bezúkhov famil
"y, Nicholas’ o"
ld friend the re
tired General V
asíli Dmítrich
 Denísov was st
aying with the R
ostóvs this fif
th of December.
  On the sixth
", which was his "
name day when th
e house would be
 full of visito
"rs, Nicholas kne"
w he would have 
to exchange his 
Tartar tunic for
"
a tail coat, a"
nd put on narrow
 boots with poin
"ted toes, and dr"
ive to the new 
church he had bu
"ilt, and then re"
ceive visitors w
ho would come to
 congratulate h
"im, offer them r"
"efreshments, and"
 talk about the 
elections of th
e nobility; but 
he considered hi
mself entitled t
o spend the eve 
 of that day in 
his usual way. H
e examined the b
ailiff’s accou
nts of the vill
age in Ryazán w
hich belonged to
 his wife’s ne
"phew, wrote two"
 business letter
"s, and walked ov"
er to the granar
"ies, cattle yard"
s and stables b
efore dinner. Ha
ving taken preca
utions against t
he general drun
kenness to be ex
pected on the mo
rrow because it 
was a great sain
"t’s
day, he r"
eturned to dinne
"r, and without h"
aving time for a
 private talk w
ith his wife sat
 down at the lon
g table laid for
" twenty persons,"
 at which the w
hole household h
ad assembled. At
 that table were
" his mother,
hi"
s mother’s old
 lady companion 
"Belóva, his wif"
"e, their three c"
hildren with th
eir governess an
"d tutor, his wif"
e’s nephew wit
"h his tutor, Só"
"nya,
Denísov, "
"Natásha, her th"
"ree children, th"
"eir governess, a"
nd old Michael 
"Ivánovich, the "
late prince’s 
"architect, who w"
as living on in 
retirement at B
ald Hills.  Co
untess Mary sat 
at the other end
 of the table. W
hen her husband 
took his place 
"she concluded, f"
rom the rapid ma
nner in which af
ter taking up h
is table napkin 
he pushed back t
he tumbler and w
ineglass standin
"g
before him, t"
hat he was out o
"f humor, as was "
sometimes the ca
se when he came
 in to dinner st
raight from the 
farm—especiall
y before the sou
p. Countess Mar
y well knew that
" mood of his, an"
d when she herse
lf was in a goo
d frame of mind 
quietly waited t
ill he had had h
is soup and then
 began to talk 
to him and make 
him admit that t
here was no caus
e for his ill-h
umor. But today 
she quite forgot
 that and was hu
rt that he shoul
d be angry with
 her without any
" reason, and she"
 felt unhappy. S
he asked him wh
ere he had been.
 He replied. She
 again inquired 
whether everyth
ing was going we
ll on the farm. 
Her unnatural to
ne made him winc
e unpleasantly 
and he replied h
astily.  “Th
en I’m not mis
"taken,” though"
t Countess Mary.
 “Why is he cr
oss with me?”
 She concluded f
rom his tone tha
t he was vexed w
ith her and wish
ed to end the c
onversation. She
 knew her remark
s sounded unnatu
"ral, but
could "
not refrain from
 asking some mor
e questions.  
Thanks to Denís
ov the conversat
ion at table soo
n became general
" and
lively, an"
d she did not ta
lk to her husban
d. When they lef
t the table and
 went as usual t
o thank the old 
"countess, Counte"
ss Mary held out
 her hand and k
issed her husban
"d, and asked him"
 why he was angr
y with her.  �
��You always hav
e such strange f
ancies! I didn�
�t even think of
" being
angry,�"
� he replied.  
 But the word al
ways seemed to h
er to imply: “
"Yes, I am angry "
but I won’t t
ell you why.” 
  Nicholas and 
his wife lived t
ogether so happi
ly that even Só
nya and the old
" countess, who f"
elt jealous and 
would have liked
 them to disagre
"e,
could find n"
othing to reproa
ch them with; bu
t even they had 
their moments o
f antagonism. Oc
"casionally, and "
it was always ju
st after they h
ad been happiest
" together, they "
suddenly had a f
eeling of estran
gement and host
"ility, which occ"
urred most frequ
ently during Cou
ntess Mary’s 
"pregnancies, and"
 this was such a
 time.  “Wel
"l, messieurs et "
"mesdames,” sai"
d Nicholas loudl
y and with appar
ent cheerfulnes
s (it seemed to 
Countess Mary th
at he did it on 
purpose to vex 
"her), “I have "
been on my feet 
since six this m
orning. Tomorrow
 I shall have t
"o suffer, so tod"
ay I’ll go and
 rest.”  And
 without a word 
to his wife he w
ent to the littl
e sitting room a
nd lay down on 
the sofa.  “
That’s always 
"the way,” thou"
ght Countess Mar
y. “He talks t
o everyone exce
pt me. I see... 
I see that I am 
repulsive to him
", especially whe"
n I am in this 
condition.” Sh
e looked down at
 her expanded fi
gure and in the 
 glass at her pa
"le, sallow, emac"
iated face in wh
ich her eyes now
 looked larger 
than ever.  An
d everything ann
oyed her—Dení
sov’s shouting
" and laughter, N"
atásha’s tal
"k, and especiall"
y a quick glance
 Sónya gave her
.  Sónya was 
always the first
 excuse Countess
 Mary found for 
feeling irritat
ed.  Having sa
t awhile with he
r visitors witho
ut understanding
 anything of wh
at they were say
"ing, she softly "
left the room an
d went to the nu
rsery.  The ch
ildren were play
ing at “going 
to Moscow” in 
a carriage made 
of chairs and i
nvited her to go
 with them. She 
sat down and pla
yed with them a
" little, but the"
 thought of her 
husband and his 
unreasonable cr
ossness worried 
her. She got up 
"and, walking on "
tiptoe with dif
"ficulty, went to"
 the small sitti
ng room.  “P
erhaps he is not
 asleep; I’ll 
have an explanat
"ion with him,”"
 she said to he
rself. Little An
"drew, her eldest"
" boy, imitating "
"his mother,
fol"
lowed her on tip
toe. She did not
 notice him.  
"“Mary, dear, I"
 think he is asl
eep—he was so 
"tired,” said S"
"ónya, meeting
"
her in the large
 sitting room (i
t seemed to Coun
tess Mary that s
he crossed her 
path everywhere)
. “Andrew may 
wake him.”  
Countess Mary lo
"oked round, saw "
little Andrew fo
"llowing her, fel"
t that Sónya w
"as right, and fo"
r that very reas
on flushed and w
ith evident dif
ficulty refraine
d from saying so
mething harsh. S
he made no reply
", but
to avoid "
obeying Sónya b
eckoned to Andre
w to follow her 
quietly and went
 to the door. S
ónya went away 
by another door.
 From the room i
n which Nichola
s was sleeping c
ame the sound of
 his even breath
"ing, every
slig"
htest tone of wh
ich was familiar
 to his wife. As
 she listened to
 it she saw bef
ore her his smoo
th handsome fore
"head, his mustac"
"he, and his
who"
"le face, as she "
had so often see
n it in the stil
lness of the nig
ht when he slep
t. Nicholas sudd
enly moved and c
leared his throa
t. And at that 
moment little An
drew shouted fro
m outside the do
or: “Papa! Mam
ma’s standing
 here!” Counte
ss Mary turned p
ale with fright 
and made signs 
to the boy. He g
"rew silent, and "
quiet ensued for
" a moment, terri"
ble to Countess
 Mary. She knew 
how Nicholas dis
liked being wake
d. Then through 
 the door she he
ard Nicholas cle
aring his throat
 again and stirr
"ing, and
his vo"
ice said crossly
:  “I can’
t get a moment�
�s peace.... Mar
"y, is that you? "
Why did you brin
g him here?” 
  “I only cam
e in to look and
 did not notice.
.. forgive me...
.”  Nicholas
 coughed and sai
d no more. Count
ess Mary moved a
way from the do
or and took the 
boy back to the 
nursery. Five mi
nutes later litt
le black-eyed t
hree-year-old Na
"tásha, her fath"
"er’s pet, havi"
ng learned from 
 her brother tha
t Papa was aslee
p and Mamma was 
in the sitting r
"oom, ran
to her"
 father unobserv
ed by her mother
. The dark-eyed 
little girl bold
ly opened the c
"reaking door, we"
nt up to the sof
a with energetic
 steps of her s
turdy little leg
"s, and having ex"
amined the posit
ion of her fathe
"r,
who was asle"
ep with his back
" to her, rose on"
 tiptoe and kiss
ed the hand whi
ch lay under his
 head. Nicholas 
turned with a te
nder smile on hi
s face.  “N
"atásha, Natásh"
a!” came Count
ess Mary’s fri
ghtened whisper 
from the door. 
“Papa wants to
 sleep.”  �
"�No, Mamma, he d"
oesn’t want to
" sleep,” said "
little Natásha 
with conviction
. “He’s laug
hing.”  Nich
olas lowered his
" legs, rose, and"
 took his daught
er in his arms. 
"

“Come in, M"
"ary,” he said "
to his wife.  
She went in and 
sat down by her 
husband.  “I
 did not notice 
him following me
",” she said ti"
midly. “I just
 looked in.” 
  Holding his l
ittle girl with 
"one arm, Nichola"
s glanced at his
" wife and,
seei"
ng her guilty ex
"pression, put hi"
s other arm arou
nd her and kisse
d her hair.  
“May I kiss Ma
mma?” he asked
 Natásha.  Na
tásha smiled ba
shfully.  “A
gain!” she com
"manded, pointing"
 with a perempto
ry gesture to th
e spot where Ni
cholas had place
d the kiss.  �
��I don’t know
 why you think I
" am cross,” sa"
"id Nicholas, rep"
lying to the qu
estion he knew w
as in his wife�
�s mind.  “Y
ou have no idea 
"how unhappy, how"
" lonely, I feel "
when you are lik
e that. It alwa
ys seems to me..
".”

“Mary,"
 don’t talk no
nsense. You ough
t to be ashamed 
of yourself!” 
he said gaily. 
  “It seems t
o be that you ca
"n’t love me, t"
hat I am so plai
n... always... 
and now... in th
is cond...”  
"
“Oh, how absu"
rd you are! It i
s not beauty tha
"t endears, it’"
s love that mak
es us see beauty
. It is only Mal
vínas and women
 of that kind wh
o are loved for
 their beauty. B
ut do I love my 
wife? I don’t 
"love her, but..."
 I don’t know
 how to put it. 
"Without you, or "
when something c
omes between us
" like this, I se"
em lost and can�
��t do anything.
 Now do I love m
y finger? I don
"’t love it, bu"
t just try to cu
t it off!”  
“I’m not lik
"e that myself, b"
ut I understand.
 So you’re not
 angry with me?
”  “Awfull
y angry!” he s
"aid, smiling and"
 getting up. And
 smoothing his h
air he began to
 pace the room. 
  “Do you kno
"w, Mary, what I�"
��ve been thinki
"ng?” he began,"
 immediately th
inking aloud in 
his wife’s pre
sence now that t
hey had made it 
up.  He did no
t ask if she was
 ready to listen
 to him. He did 
not care. A tho
ught had occurre
d to him and so 
it belonged to h
er also. And he 
told her of his
 intention to pe
rsuade Pierre to
 stay with them 
till spring.  
Countess Mary li
stened till he h
"ad finished, mad"
"e some remark, a"
nd in her turn 
began thinking a
loud. Her though
ts were about th
e children.  �
��You can see th
e woman in her a
"lready,” she s"
"aid in French, p"
ointing to litt
le Natásha. “
You reproach us 
women with being
 illogical. Here
 is our logic. 
I say: ‘Papa w
ants to sleep!�
"� but she says, "
"‘No, he’s la"
ughing.’ And 
"she was right,�"
� said Countess 
Mary with a happ
y smile.  “Y
"es, yes.” And "
"Nicholas, taking"
 his little daug
hter in his stro
"ng hand,
lifted"
" her high, place"
d her on his sho
"ulder, held her "
"by the legs, and"
 paced the room
 with her. There
 was an expressi
on of carefree h
appiness on the
 faces of both f
ather and daught
er.  “But yo
u know you may b
e unfair. You ar
e too fond of th
"is one,” his w"
ife whispered i
n French.  “
"Yes, but what am"
 I to do?... I t
ry not to show..
.”  At that 
moment they hear
d the sound of t

 the hall and an
"teroom, as if so"
meone had arrive

y has come.” 
 “I am sure i
t is Pierre. I w
"ill go and see,�"
�� said Countess
 Mary and left 
the room.  In 
her absence Nich
olas allowed him
self to give his
 little daughter
 a gallop round
 the room. Out o
"f breath, he too"
k the laughing c
hild quickly fr
om his shoulder 
and pressed her 
to his heart. Hi
s capers reminde
d him of dancin

would be like wh

 into society a

azurka with her 
as his old fathe
r had danced Da

 his daughter. 
"
“It is he, i"
"t is he, Nichola"
s!” said Count
"ess Mary, re-ent"
ering the room 
a few minutes la
ter. “Now our 
Natásha has com

 to herself. A s
mile lit up her 
face but at the

eep eyes express
ed a quiet sadne
ss as though she

"her happiness, t"

   CHAPTER X 
  Natásha had 
married in the e
arly spring of 1
"813, and in 1820"
 already had th
ree daughters be
sides a son for 
whom she had lon
ged and whom she
 was now nursin
g. She had grown
 stouter and bro
"ader, so that it"
 was difficult 
to recognize in 
"this robust, mot"
herly woman the 
"slim, lively Nat"
ásha of former
 days. Her featu
res were more de
fined and had a 
"calm, soft,
and"
 serene expressi
on. In her face 
there was none o
f the ever-glowi
ng animation th
at had formerly 
burned there and
 constituted its
 charm. Now her
 face and body w
ere often all th
"at one saw, and "
her soul was no
t visible at all
. All that struc
k the eye was a 
"strong, handsome"
", and
fertile w"
oman. The old fi
re very rarely k
indled in her fa
ce now. That ha
ppened only when
", as was the cas"
"e that day, her "
husband returned
" home,
or a sic"
k child was conv
"alescent, or whe"
n she and Counte
ss Mary spoke of
 Prince Andrew 
(she never menti
oned him to her 
"husband, who she"
 imagined was j
ealous of Prince
 Andrew’s memo
"ry), or on the r"
are occasions wh
en something ha
ppened to induce
" her to sing, a "
practice she had
 quite abandone
d since her marr
iage. At the rar
e moments when t
he old fire did
 kindle in her h
"andsome, fully d"
eveloped body sh
e was even more 
 attractive than
 in former days.
  Since their 
marriage Natásh
a and her husban
d had lived in M
"oscow, in
Peter"
"sburg, on their "
estate near Mosc
"ow, or with her "
"mother, that is "
"to
say, in Nich"
olas’ house. T
he young Countes
s Bezúkhova was
 not often seen 
"
in society, and"
 those who met h
er there were no
t pleased with h
er and found he
r neither attrac
tive nor amiable
. Not that Natá
sha liked solit
ude—she did no
t know whether s
he liked it or n
"ot, she even tho"
ught that she d
id not—but wit
h her pregnancie
"s, her confineme"
"nts, the nursing"
 of her childre
"n, and sharing e"
very moment of h
er husband’s l
"ife, she had
de"
mands on her tim
e which could be
 satisfied only 
by renouncing so
ciety. All who 
had known Natás
ha before her ma
rriage wondered 
at the change i
n her as at some
thing extraordin
ary. Only the ol
d countess with 
her maternal in
stinct had reali
zed that all Nat
ásha’s outbur
sts had been due
 to her need of
 children and a 
husband—as she
 herself had onc
e exclaimed at 
Otrádnoe not so
 much in fun as 
in earnest—and
 her mother was 
now surprised a
t the surprise e
xpressed by thos
e who had never 
understood Nat�
"�sha, and she ke"
pt saying that s
he had always kn
own that Natásh
a would make an
 exemplary wife 
and mother.  �
��Only she lets 
her love of her 
husband and chil
dren overflow al
"l
bounds,” sa"
"id the countess,"
 “so that it e
ven becomes absu
rd.”  Natás
ha did not follo
w the golden rul
e advocated by c
"lever folk,
esp"
ecially by the F
"rench, which say"
s that a girl sh
ould not let her
self go when sh
"e marries, shoul"
d not neglect he
r accomplishment
"s, should be
ev"
en more careful 
of her appearanc
e than when she 
"was unmarried, a"
nd should fasci
nate her husband
 as much as she 
did before he be
came her husban
d. Natásha on t
he contrary had 
at once abandone
d all her witche
"ry,
of which he"
r singing had be
en an unusually 
powerful part. S
he gave it up j
ust because it w
as so powerfully
 seductive. She 
took no pains wi
th her manners 
or with delicacy
" of speech, or w"
"ith her toilet, "
or to show hers
elf to her husba
nd in her most b
ecoming attitude
"s, or to avoid
"
inconveniencing 
him by being too
 exacting. She a
cted in contradi
ction to all th
ose rules. She f
elt that the all
urements instinc
t had formerly 
taught her to us
e would now be m
erely ridiculous
 in the eyes of 
"
her husband, to"
 whom she had fr
om the first mom
ent given hersel
f up entirely�
"�that is, with h"
"er whole soul, l"
eaving no corner
 of it hidden f
rom him. She fel
t that her unity
 with her husban
d was not mainta
ined by the poe
tic feelings tha
t had attracted 
"him to her, but "
by something el
se—indefinite 
but firm as the 
bond between her
 own body and so
ul.  To fluff 
"out her curls, p"
ut on fashionabl
"e dresses, and s"
ing romantic so
ngs to fascinate
 her husband wou
ld have seemed a
s strange as to 
adorn herself t
o attract hersel
f. To adorn hers
elf for others m
ight perhaps ha
ve been agreeabl
e—she did not 
know—but she h
ad no time at al
l for it. The c
hief reason for 
devoting no time
 either to singi
"ng, to dress, or"
 to choosing he
r words was that
 she really had 
no time to spare
 for these thin
gs.  We know t
hat man has the 
faculty of becom
ing completely a
bsorbed in a su
bject however tr
"ivial it may be,"
 and that there 
is no subject so
 trivial that i
t will not grow 
to infinite prop
ortions if one�
�s entire atten
tion is devoted 
to it.  The su
bject which whol
ly engrossed Nat
ásha’s attent
ion was her fami
"ly:
that is, he"
r husband whom s
he had to keep s
o that he should
 belong entirel
y to her and to 
"the home, and th"
e children whom 
"she had to bear,"
 bring into the
" world, nurse, a"
nd bring up.  
And the deeper s
"he penetrated, n"
ot with her mind
 only but with h
"er whole
soul, "
"her whole being,"
 into the subjec
t that absorbed 
"her, the larger"
 did that subjec
t grow and the w
eaker and more i
nadequate did he
r powers appear
", so that she co"
ncentrated them 
wholly on that o
ne thing and yet
 was unable to 
accomplish all t
hat she consider
ed necessary.  
 There were then
 as now conversa
tions and discus
sions about wome
"n’s
rights, t"
he relations of 
husband and wife
 and their freed
"om and rights,
"
though these the
mes were not yet
 termed question
s as they are no
w; but these to
pics were not me
rely uninteresti
"ng to Natásha, "
she positively 
did not understa
nd them.  Thes
"e questions, the"
"n as now, existe"
d only for those
 who see nothing
 in marriage bu
t the pleasure m
arried people ge
t from one anoth
"er, that is,
on"
ly the beginning
s of marriage an
d not its whole 
"significance, wh"
ich lies in the
 family.  Disc
ussions and ques
tions of that ki
"nd, which are li"
ke the question 
of how to get t
he greatest grat
ification from o
"ne’s dinner, d"
id not then and
 do not now exis
t for those for 
whom the purpose
 of a dinner is 
the nourishment
 it affords; and
 the purpose of 
marriage is the 
family.  If th
e purpose of din
ner is to nouris
"h the body, a ma"
n who eats two 
dinners at once 
may perhaps get 
more enjoyment b
ut will not atta
"in his
purpose,"
 for his stomach
 will not digest
 the two dinners
.  If the purp
ose of marriage 
"is the family, t"
he person who wi
shes to have ma
ny wives or husb
ands may perhaps
 obtain much ple
"asure, but in th"
at case will no
t have a family.
  If the purpo
se of food is no
urishment and th
e purpose of mar
riage is the fa
"mily, the whole "
question resolve
s itself into no
t eating more th
an one can dige
"st, and not havi"
ng more wives or
 husbands than a
re needed for t
he family—that
" is, one wife or"
 one husband. Na
tásha needed a 
husband. A husb
and was given he
r and he gave he
r a family. And 
she not only saw
 no need of any
 other or better
" husband, but as"
 all the powers 
of her soul wer
e intent on serv
ing that husband
" and family, she"
 could not imagi
ne and saw no i
nterest in imagi
ning how it woul
d be if things w
ere different. 
  Natásha did 
not care for soc
"iety in general,"
 but prized the 
more the societ
y of her relativ
es—Countess Ma
"ry, and her brot"
"her, her mother,"
 and Sónya. Sh
e valued the com
pany of those to
 whom she could 
come striding d
isheveled from t
he nursery in he
"r dressing gown,"
 and with joyful
 face show a ye
llow instead of 
a green stain on
 baby’s napkin
", and from whom"
 she could hear 
reassuring words
 to the effect t
hat baby was muc
h better.  To 
such an extent h
ad Natásha let 
herself go that 
the way she dres
sed and did her
" hair, her ill-c"
"hosen words, and"
 her jealousy—
she was jealous 
"
of Sónya, of t"
"he governess, an"
d of every woman
", pretty or plai"
n—were habitu
al subjects of j
est to those abo
ut her. The gene
ral opinion was 
 that Pierre was
 under his wife�
"��s thumb, which"
 was really true
. From the very
 first days of t
heir married lif
e Natásha had a
nnounced her dem
ands. Pierre wa
s greatly surpri
sed by his wife�
"��s view, to him"
 a perfectly no
"vel one, that ev"
ery moment of hi
s life belonged 
to her and to th
e family. His w
ife’s demands 
"astonished him, "
but they also fl
"attered him,
an"
d he submitted t
o them.  Pierr
e’s subjection
 consisted in th
e fact that he n
ot only dared no
"t
flirt with, b"
ut dared not eve
n speak smilingl
"y to, any other "
woman; did not 
dare dine at the
 Club as a pasti
"me, did not dare"
 spend money on 
"a
whim, and did"
 not dare absent
 himself for any
" length of time,"
 except on busi
ness—in which 
his wife include
d his intellectu
"al pursuits, whi"
ch she did not 
in the least und
erstand but to w
hich she attribu
ted great impor
tance. To make u
"p for this, at h"
ome Pierre had t
he right to reg
ulate his life a
nd that of the w
hole family exac
tly as he chose.
 At home Natás
ha placed hersel
f in the positio
n of a slave to 
"her husband,
an"
d the whole hous
ehold went on ti
ptoe when he was
 occupied—that
" is, was
readin"
g or writing in 
his study. Pierr
e had but to sho
w a partiality f
or anything to 
get just what he
 liked done alwa
ys. He had only 
to express a wi
sh and Natásha 
would jump up an
d run to fulfill
 it.  The enti
re household was
 governed accord
ing to Pierre’
s supposed order
"s,
that is, by "
his wishes which
 Natásha tried 
to guess. Their 
way of life and
 place of reside
"nce, their acqua"
intances and tie
"s, Natásha’s"
"
occupations, th"
e children’s u
"pbringing, were "
all selected not
 merely with re
gard to Pierre�
�s expressed wis
"hes, but to what"
 Natásha from t
he thoughts he 
expressed in con
versation suppos
ed his wishes to
 be. And she de
duced the essent
ials of his wish
es quite correct
"ly, and having o"
nce arrived at 
them clung to th
em tenaciously. 
When Pierre hims
elf wanted to c
hange his mind s
he would fight h
im with his own 
weapons.  Thus
 in a time of tr
ouble ever memor
able to him afte
r the birth of t
heir first chil
d who was delica
"te, when they ha"
d to change the 
wet nurse three
 times and Natá
sha fell ill fro
"m despair, Pierr"
e one day told h
er of Rousseau�
"��s view, with w"
hich he quite ag
"reed, that to ha"
ve a wet nurse 
is unnatural and
 harmful. When h
er next baby was
" born, despite
"
the opposition o
"f her mother, th"
"e doctors, and e"
ven of her husba
nd himself—wh
o were all vigor
ously opposed to
 her nursing her
" baby herself,
"
a thing then unh
eard of and cons
idered injurious
—she insisted 
on having her o
"wn way, and afte"
r that nursed al
l her babies her
self.  It very
 often happened 
that in a moment
 of irritation h
usband and wife 
 would have a di
"spute, but long "
afterwards Pierr
e to his surpris
e and delight w
ould find in his
 wife’s ideas 
and actions the 
very thought ag
ainst which she 
"had argued, but "
divested of ever
ything superfluo
us that in the 
excitement of th
e dispute he had
 added when expr
essing his opin
ion.  After se
ven years of mar
riage Pierre had
 the joyous and 
firm consciousn
ess that he was 
"not a bad man, a"
nd he felt this 
because he saw 
himself reflecte
d in his wife. H
e felt the good 
and bad within h
imself inextric
ably mingled and
 overlapping. Bu
t only what was 
really good in 
him was reflecte
"d in his wife, a"
ll that was not 
quite good was r
ejected. And th
is was not the r
esult of logical
 reasoning but w
as a direct and 
 mysterious refl
ection.     
  CHAPTER XI  
 Two months prev
iously when Pier
re was already s
taying with the 
Rostóvs he had
 received a lett
er from Prince T
"heodore, asking "
him to come to 
Petersburg to co
nfer on some imp
ortant questions
 that were being
 discussed ther
e by a society o
f which Pierre w
as one of the pr
incipal founder
s.  On reading
 that letter (sh
e always read he
r husband’s le
tters) Natásha 
 herself suggest
ed that he shoul
d go to Petersbu
"rg, though she w"
ould feel his a
bsence very acut
ely. She attribu
ted immense impo
rtance to all h
er husband’s i
ntellectual and 
abstract interes
ts though she di
d not understan
"d them, and she "
always dreaded b
eing a hindrance
 to him in such 
 matters. To Pie
rre’s timid lo
ok of inquiry af
ter reading the 
letter she repl
ied by asking hi
"m to go, but to "
fix a definite d
ate for his retu
rn. He was give
n four weeks’ 
leave of absence
.  Ever since 
that leave of ab
sence had expire
"d, more than a f"
ortnight before
", Natásha had b"
een in a constan
t state of alarm
", depression, an"
d irritability.
"

Denísov, no"
w a general on t
he retired list 
and much dissati
sfied with the 
present state of
" affairs, had ar"
rived during tha
t fortnight. He 
 looked at Natá
sha with sorrow 
and surprise as 
at a bad likenes
s of a person o
nce dear. A dull
", dejected look,"
" random replies,"
 and talk about 
 the nursery was
 all he saw and 
heard from his f
ormer enchantres
s.  Natásha w
as sad and irrit
able all that ti
"me, especially w"
"hen her mother,"
"
her brother, S�"
"�nya, or Countes"
s Mary in their 
efforts to conso
le her tried to
 excuse Pierre a
nd suggested rea
sons for his del
ay in returning.
  “It’s al
"l nonsense, all "
rubbish—those 
discussions whic
h lead to nothin
g and all those
 idiotic societi
es!” Natásha 
declared of the 
very affairs in
 the immense imp
ortance of which
 she firmly beli
eved.  And she
 would go to the
 nursery to nurs
"e Pétya, her on"
ly boy. No one 
else could tell 
her anything so 
comforting or so
 reasonable as t
his little thre
e-month-old crea
ture when he lay
 at her breast a
nd she was cons
cious of the mov
ement of his lip
s and the snuffl
ing of his littl
e nose. That cr
eature said: “
"You are angry, y"
"ou are jealous, "
you would like 
"to pay him out, "
you are afraid�
�but here am I! 
And I am he...�
� and that was 
unanswerable. It
 was more than t
rue.  During t
hat fortnight of
 anxiety Natásh
a resorted to th
e baby for comf
"ort so often, an"
d fussed over hi
"m so much, that "
she overfed him 
and he fell ill
. She was terrif
ied by his illne
"ss, and yet that"
 was just what 
she needed. Whil
e attending to h
im she bore the 
anxiety about he
r husband more 
easily.  She w
as nursing her b
oy when the soun
d of Pierre’s 
sleigh was heard
 at the front d
"oor, and the old"
 nurse—knowing
 how to please h
er mistress—e
ntered the room 
inaudibly but hu
rriedly and with
 a beaming face
.  “Has he c
ome?” Natásha
 asked quickly i
"n a whisper, afr"
aid to move lest
 she should rou
se the dozing ba
by.  “He’s
" come, ma’am,�"
�� whispered the
 nurse.  The b
lood rushed to N
atásha’s face
 and her feet in
voluntarily move
"d, but
she coul"
d not jump up an
d run out. The b
aby again opened
 his eyes and l
ooked at her. �
�You’re here?�
�� he seemed to 
"be saying, and a"
gain lazily sma
cked his lips. 
 Cautiously wit
hdrawing her bre
"ast, Natásha ro"
cked him a littl
"e, handed
him t"
"o the nurse, and"
 went with rapid
 steps toward th
e door. But at t
he door she sto
pped as if her c
onscience reproa
ched her for hav
ing in her joy 
left the child t
"oo soon, and she"
 glanced round. 
The nurse with 
raised elbows wa
s lifting the in
fant over the ra
il of his cot. 
"
“Go, ma’am"
"! Don’t worry,"
 go!” she whis
"pered, smiling, "
with the kind of
 familiarity th
at grows up betw
een a nurse and 
her mistress.  
 Natásha ran wi
th light footste
ps to the antero
"om.

Denísov,"
 who had come ou
t of the study i
nto the dancing 
room with his p
"ipe, now for the"
 first time reco
gnized the old N
atásha. A flood
" of
brilliant, "
joyful light pou
red from her tra
nsfigured face. 
  “He’s com
e!” she exclai
med as she ran p
"ast, and Deníso"
v felt that he t
oo was delighte
"d that Pierre, w"
hom he did not m
"uch care for, ha"
d returned.  O
n reaching the v
estibule Natásh
a saw a tall fig
ure in a fur coa
t unwinding his
 scarf. “It’
s he! It’s rea
lly he! He has c
ome!” she said
"
to herself, an"
d rushing at him
" embraced him, p"
ressed his head 
"to her
breast, "
and then pushed 
him back and gaz
"ed at his ruddy,"
" happy face,
co"
vered with hoarf
"rost. “Yes, it"
" is he, happy an"
d contented....�
��  Then all a
t once she remem
bered the tortur
es of suspense s
he had experien
ced for the last
" fortnight, and "
the joy that had
 lit up her fac
e vanished; she 
frowned and over
whelmed Pierre w
ith a torrent of
 reproaches and
 angry words.  
"
“Yes, it’s "
all very well fo
r you. You are p
"leased, you’ve"
 had a good tim
e.... But what a
bout me? You mig
ht at least have
 shown considera
tion for the ch
ildren. I am nur
sing and my milk
 was spoiled....
 Pétya was at 
death’s door. 
But you were enj
oying yourself. 
"Yes, enjoying..."
”  Pierre kn
ew he was not to
" blame, for he c"
ould not have co
me sooner; he k
new this outburs
t was unseemly a
nd would blow ov
er in a minute o
r two; above al
l he knew that h
e himself was br
ight and happy. 
He wanted to sm
ile but dared no
t even think of 
doing so. He mad
"e a piteous,
fr"
ightened face an
d bent down.  
"“I could not, "
on my honor. But
 how is Pétya?�
��  “All rig
ht now. Come alo
ng! I wonder you

could see what I

fered!”  “
You are well?”
"

“Come, com"
"e!” she said, "
not letting go o
f his arm. And t
hey went to the
ir rooms.  Whe
n Nicholas and h
is wife came to 
look for Pierre 
he was in the nu
rsery holding h
"is baby son, who"
 was again awake
", on his huge ri"
ght palm and da
ndling him. A bl
issful bright sm
ile was fixed on
 the baby’s br
oad face with i
ts toothless ope
n mouth. The sto
rm was long sinc
e over and there
"
was bright, jo"
yous sunshine on
 Natásha’s fa
ce as she gazed 
tenderly at her
 husband and chi
ld.  “And ha
ve you talked ev
erything well ov
er with Prince T
heodore?” she 
 asked.  “Ye
"s, capitally.”"
"

“You see, "
he holds it up.�
�� (She meant th
e baby’s head.
) “But how he 
did frighten me
... You’ve see
n the princess? 
Is it true she�
�s in love with 
 that...”  �
"��Yes, just fanc"
y...”  At th
at moment Nichol
as and Countess 
Mary came in. Pi
erre with the ba
by on his hand 
"stooped, kissed "
"them, and replie"
d to their inqui
ries. But in sp
ite of much that
 was interesting
 and had to be d
"iscussed, the ba"
by with the lit
tle cap on its u
nsteady head evi
dently absorbed 
all his attenti
on.  “How sw
eet!” said Cou
"ntess Mary, look"
ing at and playi

".
“Now, Nicho"

  “And yet h

“Now,"
 Pierre nurses t

. “He says his

     CHAPTER
 XII  As in ev
ery large househ
"old, there were "
at Bald Hills se
veral perfectly 
 distinct worlds
 which merged in
to one harmoniou
"s whole, though "
each retained i
ts own peculiari
ties and made co
ncessions to the
 others. Every 
"event, joyful or"
" sad, that took "
place in that ho
use was importan
t to all these 
"worlds, but each"
 had its own spe
cial reasons to 
rejoice or griev
e over that occ
urrence independ
ently of the oth
ers.  For inst
"ance, Pierre’s"
 return was a jo
yful and importa
nt event and the
y all felt it t
o be so.  The 
servants—the m
ost reliable jud
ges of their mas
ters because the
y judge not by 
their conversati
on or expression
s of feeling but
 by their acts 
and way of life�
��were glad of P
ierre’s return
 because they kn
ew that when he
 was there Count
 Nicholas would 
cease going ever
y day to attend 
"
to the estate, "
and would be in 
better spirits a
"nd temper, and a"
lso because the
y would all rece
ive handsome pre
sents for the ho
lidays.  The c
hildren and thei
r governesses we
re glad of Pierr
e’s return bec
ause no one els
e drew them into
 the social life
 of the househol
d as he did. He
 alone could pla
y on the clavich
ord that écossa
ise (his only pi
"ece)
to which, "
"as he said, all "
possible dances 
"could be danced,"
 and they felt 
sure he had brou
ght presents for
 them all.  Yo
"ung Nicholas, no"
w a slim lad of 
"fifteen, delicat"
e and intelligen
"t,
with curly l"
ight-brown hair 
and beautiful ey
"es, was delighte"
d because Uncle
 Pierre as he ca
lled him was the
 object of his r
apturous and pa
ssionate affecti
on. No one had i
nstilled into hi
m this love for 
Pierre whom he 
saw only occasio
nally. Countess 
Mary who had bro
ught him up had
 done her utmost
 to make him lov
e her husband as
" she loved him, "
and little Nich
olas did love hi
"s uncle, but lov"
ed him with just
 a shade of con
"tempt. Pierre, h"
"owever, he adore"
d. He did not wa
nt to be an huss
ar or a Knight 
of St. George li
ke his uncle Nic
holas; he wanted
" to be learned,"
"
wise, and kind "
like Pierre. In 
Pierre’s prese
nce his face alw
ays shone with 
pleasure and he 
flushed and was 
breathless when 
Pierre spoke to 
 him. He did not
 miss a single w
"ord he uttered, "
and would afterw
"ards,
with Dess"
alles or by hims
"elf, recall and "
reconsider the m
eaning of every
thing Pierre had
 said. Pierre’
s past life and 
his unhappiness 
prior to 1812 (
of which young N
icholas had form
ed a vague poeti
c picture from 
some words he ha
"d overheard), hi"
s adventures in 
"Moscow, his capt"
"ivity,
Platón "
Karatáev (of wh
om he had heard 
"from Pierre), hi"
s love for Natá
sha (of whom th
e lad was also p
articularly fond
"), and especiall"
y Pierre’s fr
iendship with th
e father whom Ni
cholas could not
 remember—all 
this made Pierr
e in his eyes a 
hero and a saint
.  From broken
 remarks about N
atásha and his 
"father, from the"
 emotion with w
hich Pierre spok
e of that dead f
"ather, and from "
"the careful, rev"
erent tendernes
s with which Nat
ásha spoke of h
"im, the boy, who"
 was only just 
beginning to gue
"ss what love is,"
 derived the not
ion that his fat
her had loved N
atásha and when
 dying had left 
her to his frien
d. But the fathe
r whom the boy 
did not remember
 appeared to him
 a divinity who 
could not be pi
"ctured, and of w"
hom he never tho
ught without a s
welling heart an
d tears of sadn
ess and rapture.
 So the boy also
 was happy that 
Pierre had arri
ved.  The gues
ts welcomed Pier
re because he al
ways helped to e
nliven and unite
 any company he
 was in.  The 
grown-up members
" of the family, "
not to mention h
"is wife, were
p"
leased to have b
ack a friend who
se presence made
 life run more s
moothly and pea
cefully.  The 
old ladies were 
pleased with the
 presents he bro
"ught them, and
"
especially that 
Natásha would n
ow be herself ag
ain.  Pierre f
elt the differen
t outlooks of th
ese various worl
ds and made has
te to satisfy al
l their expectat
ions.  Though 
the most absent-
minded and forge
"tful of men, Pie"
"rre, with the ai"
d of a list his
" wife drew up, h"
ad now bought ev
"erything, not fo"
rgetting his mo
ther—and broth
er-in-law’s co
"mmissions, nor t"
he dress materia
l for a present
" to Belóva, nor"
 toys for his wi
fe’s nephews. 
In the early day
s of his marria
ge it had seemed
 strange to him 
that his wife sh
ould expect him
 not to forget t
o procure all th
e things he unde
"rtook to buy, an"
d he had been t
aken aback by he
r serious annoya
nce when on his 
first trip he f
orgot everything
. But in time he
 grew used to th
is demand. Knowi
ng that Natásh
a asked nothing 
"for herself, and"
 gave him commis
sions for others
 only when he h
imself had offer
ed to undertake 
"them, he now fou"
nd an unexpecte
d and childlike 
pleasure in this
 purchase of pre
sents for every
one in the house
", and never forg"
ot anything. If 
he now incurred 
 Natásha’s ce
nsure it was onl
y for buying too
 many and too ex
pensive things.
 To her other de
fects (as most p
eople thought th
"em, but which
t"
o Pierre were qu
alities) of unti
diness and negle
"ct of herself, s"
he now added st
inginess.  Fro
m the time that 
Pierre began lif
e as a family ma
n on a footing 
entailing heavy 
"expenditure, he "
had noticed to h
is surprise that
 he spent only 
half as much as 
"before, and that"
 his affairs—w
hich had been i
n disorder of la
"te, chiefly beca"
use of his first
 wife’s debts�
��had begun to 
improve.  Life
 was cheaper bec
ause it was circ
umscribed: that 
most expensive 
"luxury, the kind"
 of life that ca
n be changed at 
"any moment, was "
no longer his n
or did he wish f
or it. He felt t
hat his way of l
ife had now bee
n settled once f
or all till deat
h and that to ch
ange it was not 
"in
his power, a"
nd so that way o
f life proved ec
onomical.  Wit
"h a merry, smili"
ng face Pierre w
as sorting his p
urchases.  “
What do you thin
k of this?” sa
"id he, unrolling"
 a piece of stuf
f like a shopma
"n.

Natásha, "
who was sitting 
opposite to him 
with her eldest 
daughter on her 
"
lap, turned her"
 sparkling eyes 
swiftly from her
 husband to the 
things he showe
d her.  “Tha
t’s for Belóv
a? Excellent!”
 She felt the qu
ality of the mat
erial. “It wa
s a ruble an ars
"hin, I suppose?�"
��  Pierre tol
d her the price.
  “Too dear!
” Natásha rem
arked. “How pl
eased the childr
en will be and 
Mamma too! Only 
you need not hav
e bought me this
",” she added, "
unable to suppr
ess a smile as s
he gazed admirin
gly at a gold co
mb set with pear
"ls,
of a kind t"
hen just coming 
into fashion.  
 “Adèle tempt
ed me: she kept 
on telling me to
" buy it,” retu"
rned Pierre.  
“When am I to 
wear it?” and 
Natásha stuck i
t in her coil of
 hair. “When 
I take little M�
�sha into societ
y? Perhaps they 
will be fashiona
ble again by th
"en. Well, let’"
s go now.”  
And collecting t
he presents they
 went first to t
he nursery and t
hen to the old 
countess’ room
s.  The counte
ss was sitting w
ith her companio
"n Belóva, playi"
ng grand-patien
"ce as usual, whe"
n Pierre and Nat
ásha came into 
the drawing roo
m with parcels u
nder their arms.
  The countess
 was now over si
"xty, was quite g"
"ray, and wore a "
cap with a fril
l that surrounde
d her face. Her 
face had shrivel
"ed, her upper li"
"p
had sunk in, "
and her eyes wer
e dim.  After 
the deaths of he
r son and husban
d in such rapid 
"succession, she"
 felt herself a 
being accidental
ly forgotten in 
this world and l
eft without aim
 or object for h
er existence. Sh
"e ate, drank, sl"
"ept, or kept
aw"
"ake, but did not"
 live. Life gave
 her no new impr
essions. She wan
ted nothing fro
m life but tranq
"uillity, and tha"
t tranquillity o
nly death could
 give her. But u
ntil death came 
she had to go on
" living, that is"
",
to use her vi"
tal forces. A pe
culiarity one se
es in very young
 children and v
ery old people w
as particularly 
evident in her. 
Her life had no
 external aims�
�only a need to 
exercise her var
ious functions a
nd inclinations
 was apparent. S
"he had to eat, s"
"leep, think, spe"
"ak, weep,
work,"
 give vent to he
"r anger, and so "
"on, merely becau"
se she had a st
"omach, a brain, "
"muscles, nerves,"
 and a liver. Sh
e did these thin
gs not under an
y external impul
se as people in 
the full vigor o
"f life do,
when"
 behind the purp
ose for which th
ey strive that o
f exercising the
ir functions re
mains unnoticed.
 She talked only
 because she phy
sically needed 
to exercise her 
tongue and lungs
. She cried as a
" child does,
be"
cause her nose h
ad to be cleared
", and so on. Wha"
t for people in 
their full vigo
r is an aim was 
for her evidentl
y merely a prete
xt.  Thus in t
he morning—esp
ecially if she h
ad eaten anythin
g rich the day 
before—she fel
t a need of bein
g angry and woul
d choose as the 
handiest pretex
t Belóva’s de
afness.  She w
ould begin to sa
y something to h
er in a low tone
 from the other 
end of the room
.  “It seems
 a little warmer
" today, my dear,"
” she would mu
rmur.  And whe
n Belóva replie
"d: “Oh yes, th"
"ey’ve come,”"
 she would mutte
r angrily: “O
 Lord! How stupi
d and deaf she i
s!”  Another
 pretext would b
"e her snuff, whi"
ch would seem to
o dry or too dam
p or not rubbed
 fine enough. Af
ter these fits o
f irritability h
er face would g
"row yellow, and "
her maids knew b
y infallible sym
ptoms when Beló
va would again 
"be deaf, the snu"
"ff damp, and the"
 countess’ fac
e yellow. Just 
as she needed to
 work off her sp
leen so she had 
sometimes to exe
rcise her still
-existing facult
y of thinking—
and the pretext 
for that was a 
game of patience
. When she neede
"d to cry, the de"
ceased count wou
ld be the prete
xt. When she wan
ted to be agitat
"ed, Nicholas and"
 his health wou
ld be the pretex
"t, and when she "
felt a need to s
"peak spitefully,"
 the pretext wo
uld be Countess 
Mary. When her v
ocal organs need
"ed exercise,
wh"
ich was usually 
toward seven o�
�clock when she 
had had an after
-dinner rest in
 a darkened room
", the pretext wo"
uld be the retel
ling of the same
 stories over a
nd over again to
 the same audien
ce.  The old l
ady’s conditio
n was understood
 by the whole ho
usehold though n
o one ever spok
"e of it, and the"
y all made every
 possible effort
 to satisfy her
 needs. Only by 
a rare glance ex
changed with a s
ad smile betwee
"n Nicholas, Pier"
"re, Natásha, an"
d Countess Mary 
was the common 
understanding of
 her condition e
xpressed.  But
 those glances e
xpressed somethi
ng more: they sa
id that she had 
 played her part
" in life, that w"
hat they now saw
 was not her who
"le self,
that w"
e must all becom
"e like her, and "
that they were g
lad to yield to 
"
her, to restrai"
n themselves for
 this once preci
ous being former
ly as full of l
ife as themselve
"s, but now so mu"
ch to be pitied.
 “Memento mor
"i,” said these"
 glances.  Onl
y the really hea
"rtless, the stup"
id ones of that 
"household, and t"
he little child
ren failed to un
derstand this an
d avoided her. 
     CHAPTE
R XIII  When P
ierre and his wi
fe entered the d
rawing room the 
countess was in 
 one of her cust
omary states in 
which she needed
 the mental exer
tion of playing
" patience, and s"
o—though by fo
rce of habit she
 greeted him wit
h the words she
 always used whe
n Pierre or her 
son returned aft
er an absence: 
"“High time, my"
" dear, high time"
! We were all we
ary of waiting 
"for you. Well, t"
hank God!” and
 received her pr
esents with anot
her customary r
emark: “It’s
 not the gift th
"at’s precious,"
" my dear, but th"
at you give it 
"to me, an old wo"
man...”—yet 
it was evident t
hat she was not
 pleased by Pier
re’s arrival a
t that moment wh
en it diverted h
er attention fr
om the unfinishe
d game.  She f
inished her game
 of patience and
 only then exami
ned the presents
. They consiste
d of a box for c
"ards, of splendi"
"d workmanship, a"
 bright-blue S�
�vres tea cup wi
th shepherdesses
 depicted on it 
"and with
a lid,"
 and a gold snuf
fbox with the co
unt’s portrait
 on the lid whic
h Pierre had ha
d done by a mini
aturist in Peter
sburg. The count
ess had long wi
shed for such a 
"box, but as she "
did not want to 
cry just then sh
e glanced indif
ferently at the 
portrait and gav
e her attention 
chiefly to the 
box for cards. 
"
“Thank you, "
"my dear, you hav"
"e cheered me up,"
” said she as 
she always did.
 “But best of 
all you have bro
ught yourself ba
ck—for I never
 saw anything l
"ike it, you ough"
t to give your w
ife a scolding! 
What are we to 
do with her? She
 is like a mad w
oman when you ar
e away. Doesn’
"t see
anything,"
 doesn’t remem
"ber anything,”"
" she went on, re"
peating her usua
l phrases. “L
"ook, Anna Timof�"
"�evna,” she ad"
ded to her compa
"nion, “see wha"
t a box for car
ds my son has br
ought us!”  
Belóva admired 
the presents and
 was delighted w
ith her dress ma
terial.  Thoug
"h Pierre, Natás"
"ha, Nicholas, Co"
"untess Mary, and"
 Denísov had mu
ch to talk abou
t that they coul
d not discuss be
fore the old cou
ntess—not tha
t anything was h
"idden from her, "
but because she 
had dropped so 
far behindhand i
n many things th
at had they begu
n to converse in
 her presence t
hey would have h
ad to answer ino
pportune questio
ns and to repea
t what they had 
already told her
 many times: tha
t so-and-so was 
 dead and so-and
"-so was married,"
 which she would
 again be unable
 to remember—
yet they sat at 
tea round the sa
movar in the dra
wing room from 
"habit, and Pierr"
e answered the c
ountess’ quest
ions as to wheth
er Prince Vasí
li had aged and 
whether Countess
 Mary Alexéevna
 had sent greeti
ngs and still t
"hought of them, "
and other matter
s that intereste
d no one and to
 which she herse
lf was indiffere
nt.  Conversat
ion of this kind
", interesting to"
 no one yet unav
"oidable,
contin"
ued all through 
teatime. All the
 grown-up member
s of the family 
 were assembled 
near the round t
ea table at whic
h Sónya preside
d beside the sa
movar. The child
ren with their t
utors and govern
esses had had t
ea and their voi
ces were audible
 from the next r
oom. At tea all 
sat in their ac
customed places:
 Nicholas beside
 the stove at a 
small table whe
re his tea was h
anded to him; M�
"�lka, the old gr"
ay borzoi bitch 
 (daughter of th
"e first Mílka),"
 with a quite gr
ay face and larg
e black eyes th
at seemed more p
rominent than ev
"er, lay on the a"
rmchair beside 
"him; Denísov, w"
"hose curly hair,"
" mustache, and w"
hiskers had turn
"ed half
gray, s"
at beside counte
ss Mary with his
 general’s tun
ic unbuttoned; 
Pierre sat betwe
en his wife and 
the old countess
. He spoke of wh
at he knew migh
t interest the o
ld lady and that
 she could under
stand. He told 
her of external 
social events an
d of the people 
who had formed 
the circle of he
r contemporaries
 and had once be
"en a real, livin"
"g, and
distinct"
" group, but who "
were now for the
 most part scatt
ered about the 
world and like h
erself were garn
ering the last e
ars of the harve
sts they had so
wn in earlier ye
ars. But to the 
old countess tho
se contemporarie
s of hers seeme
d to be the only
 serious and rea
l society. Natá
sha saw by Pier
re’s animation
 that his visit 
had been interes
ting and that he
 had much to te
ll them but dare
 not say it befo
re the old count
"ess. Denísov,
"
not being a memb
er of the family
", did not unders"
tand Pierre’s 
caution and bei
"ng, as a malcont"
"ent, much intere"
sted in what was
 occurring in P
"etersburg, kept "
urging Pierre to
 tell them about
 what had happen
ed in the Semë
"novsk regiment, "
then about Arakc
"héev, and then "
about the Bible 
 Society. Once o
r twice Pierre w
as carried away 
and began to spe
ak of these thi
"ngs, but Nichola"
s and Natásha a
lways brought hi
m back to the h
ealth of Prince 
Iván and Counte
ss Mary Alexéev
"na.

“Well, "
and all this idi
ocy—Gossner an
d Tatáwinova?�
� Denísov asked
. “Is that we
ally still going
 on?”  “Go
ing on?” Pierr
e exclaimed. “
Why more than ev
er! The Bible So
ciety is the wh
ole government n
ow!”  “Wha
"t is that, mon c"
her ami?” aske
"d the countess, "
who had finished
 her tea and ev
idently needed a
 pretext for bei
ng angry after h
er meal. “What
 are you saying
 about the gover
nment? I don’t
 understand.” 
"

“Well, you "
"know, Maman,” "
Nicholas interpo
"sed, knowing how"
 to translate t
hings into his m
other’s langua
"ge, “Prince Al"
exander Golítsy
n has founded a
 society and in 
consequence has 
"great influence,"
 they say.”  
 “Arakchéev a

 incautiously re
"marked Pierre, �"
��are now the w
hole government!
 And what a gove
rnment! They see
 treason everywh

", and how is Pri"
nce Alexander to
 blame? He is a 
most estimable 
man. I used to m
eet him at Mary 
"Antónovna’s,�"
�� said the coun
tess in an offe
nded tone; and s
till more offend
ed that they all
 remained silent
",
she went on: "
“Nowadays ever
yone finds fault
. A Gospel Socie
"ty! Well, and
w"
hat harm is ther
e in that?” an
d she rose (ever
ybody else got u
p too) and with
 a severe expres
sion sailed back
 to her table in
 the sitting ro
om.  The melan
choly silence th
at followed was 
broken by the so
unds of the chi
ldren’s voices
 and laughter fr
om the next room
. Evidently some
 jolly exciteme
nt was going on 
there.  “Fin
"ished, finished!"
” little Natá
sha’s gleeful 
yell rose above 
them all.  Pie
rre exchanged gl
ances with Count
ess Mary and Nic
holas (Natásha 
he never lost s
ight of) and smi
led happily.  
“That’s deli
ghtful music!”
 said he.  “
It means that An
na Makárovna ha
s finished her s
"tocking,” said"
 Countess Mary.
"

“Oh, I’l"
"l go and see,”"
" said Pierre, ju"
mping up. “You
" know,” he add"
"ed,
stopping at"
" the door, “wh"
y I’m especial
ly fond of that 
music? It is al
ways the first t
hing that tells 
me all is well. 
When I was drivi
"ng
here today, "
the nearer I got
 to the house th
e more anxious I
 grew. As I ent
ered the anteroo

sha’s peals of
 laughter and th

  “I know! I 
know that feelin
"g,” said Nicho"
las. “But I mu
stn’t go ther
e—those stocki

surprise for me.
”  Pierre we
nt to the childr
"en, and the shou"
ting and laughte
r grew still lo
uder.  “Come
", Anna Makárovn"
"a,” Pierre’s"
 voice was heard
" saying, “come"
 here into the 
middle of the ro
om and at the wo
"rd of command, �"
"��One, two,’ a"
nd when I say �
��three’... Yo
"u stand here, an"

—well now! One

"id Pierre, and a"
 silence followe
d: “three!” 
and a rapturousl
y breathless cr
y of children’
s voices filled 
the room. “Two
", two!” they
"
shouted.  This
 meant two stock

 secret process 
known only to h
erself Anna Mak�

nit at the same 
time on the same
"
needles, and w"
"hich, when they "

always triumphan

     CHAPTE
R XIV  Soon af
ter this the chi

 They kissed ev

 a whisper.  �
"��Ma tante, plea"

"ded, addressing "
Countess Mary. 
  “Like my fa

"he boy, flushing"
 crimson and loo
king up at Pier
"re with bright, "
ecstatic eyes. 
"
Pierre nodded,"
 and went on wit
h what he had be
en saying when t
he children had
 interrupted. Co
untess Mary sat 
down doing woolw
ork; Natásha d
id not take her 
eyes off her hus
band. Nicholas a
nd Denísov rose
", asked
for the"
"ir pipes, smoked"
", went to fetch "
more tea from S�
�nya—who sat w
eary but resolu
te at the samova
r—and question
ed Pierre. The c
"urly-headed,
de"
licate boy sat w
ith shining eyes
 unnoticed in a 
"corner, starting"
 every now and 
then and mutteri
ng something to 
"himself, and evi"
dently experien
cing a new and p
owerful emotion 
as he turned his
" curly head,
wi"
th his thin neck
 exposed by his 
turn-down collar
", toward the pla"
ce where Pierre
 sat.  The con
versation turned
 on the contempo
rary gossip abou
t those in power
",
in which most"
 people see the 
chief interest o
f home politics.
" Denísov,
diss"
atisfied with th
e government on 
account of his o
wn disappointmen
ts in the servi
"ce, heard with p"
leasure of the t
hings done in Pe
tersburg which 
seemed to him st
"upid, and made f"
orcible and shar
p comments on wh
at Pierre told 
them.  “One 
used to have to 
be a German—no
w one must dance
 with Tatáwinov
a and Madame Kw
"üdener, and wea"
d Ecka’tshause
n and the bwethw
"en. Oh, they
sh"
ould let that fi
ne fellow Bonapa

�d knock all thi
s nonsense out 
of them! Fancy g
iving the comman
d of the Semëno
v wegiment to a 
 fellow like tha
t Schwa’tz!”
 he cried.  Ni
"cholas, though f"
ree from Deníso
v’s readiness 
to find fault wi
"th
everything, "
also thought tha
t discussion of 
the government w
as a very serio
us and weighty m
"atter, and the f"
act that A had b
een appointed M
inister of This 
and B Governor G
"eneral of That, "
and that the Emp
eror had said s
o-and-so and thi
s minister so-an
"d-so, seemed to "
him very import
ant. And so he t
hought it necess
ary to take an i
nterest in these
 things and to 
question Pierre.
 The questions p
ut by these two 
kept the conver
sation from chan
ging its ordinar
y character of g
ossip about the 
 higher governme
nt circles.  B
"ut Natásha, kno"
wing all her hus
band’s ways an
"d ideas, saw tha"
t he had long b
een wishing but 
had been unable 
to divert the co
nversation to a
nother channel a
nd express his o
wn deeply felt i
dea for the sake
 of which he ha
d gone to Peters
burg to consult 
with his new fri
end Prince Theo
"dore, and she he"
lped him by aski
ng how his affai
rs with Prince 
Theodore had gon
e.  “What wa
s it about?” a
sked Nicholas. 
 “Always the 
"same thing,” s"
"aid Pierre, look"
ing round at his
 listeners. “
Everybody sees t
hat things are g
oing so badly th
at they cannot b
e allowed to go
 on so and that 
it is the duty o
f all decent men
 to counteract 
it as far as the
y can.”  “
What can decent 
men do?” Nicho
"las inquired, fr"
owning slightly.
 “What can be
 done?”  “
"Why, this...”"
  “Come into 
"my study,” sai"
d Nicholas.  N
"atásha, who had"
 long expected t
o be fetched to 
"nurse her baby, "
now heard the n
urse calling her
 and went to the
 nursery. Counte
ss Mary followe
d her. The men w
ent into the stu
dy and little Ni
cholas Bolkónsk
i followed them
 unnoticed by hi
s uncle and sat 
down at the writ
ing table in a 
shady corner by 
the window.  �
"��Well, what wou"
ld you do?” as
ked Denísov.  
 “Always some 
fantastic scheme

las.  “Why t
"his,” began Pi"
"erre, not sittin"
g down but pacin
"g the room,
som"
etimes stopping 
"short, gesticula"

look into anythi

doned himself al
together to this
 mysticism” (P
ierre could not 
 tolerate mystic
ism in anyone no

"only for peace, "
and only these

"ife, the harsher"

"d,” he said to"
 Nicholas.    
  * Without fait
h or law.  “
"Well, what does "
that lead up to?
” said Nichola
"s.

“Well, e"
verything is goi
ng to ruin! Robb
ery in the law c
"ourts, in the
a"
rmy nothing but 
"flogging, drilli"

 Settlements; th

 young and hone
st is crushed! E
veryone sees tha
t this cannot go
 on. Everything 
is strained to 
such a degree th
at it will certa
"inly break,” s"
aid Pierre (as 
those who examin
e the actions of
 any government 
have always said
 since governme
nts began). “I
 told them just 
one thing in Pet
ersburg.”  �
��Told whom?” 
"

“Well, you "
"know whom,” sa"
"id Pierre, with "
a meaning glance
 from under his
 brows. “Princ
e Theodore and a
ll those. To enc
ourage culture a
nd philanthropy
 is all very wel
l of course. The
 aim is excellen
t but in the pr
esent circumstan
ces something el
se is needed.”
  At that mome
nt Nicholas noti
ced the presence
 of his nephew. 
His face darken
ed and he went u
p to the boy.  
 “Why are you 
here?”  “W
"hy? Let him be,�"
"�� said Pierre, "
taking Nicholas 
by the arm and 
continuing. “T
hat is not enoug
"h, I told them. "
Something else i
s needed. When 
you stand expect
ing the overstra
ined string to s
nap at any momen
"t,
when everyon"
e is expecting t
he inevitable ca
"tastrophe, as ma"
ny as possible 
must join hands 
as closely as th
ey can to withst
and the general 
 calamity. Every
thing that is yo
ung and strong i
s being enticed 
away and deprav
ed. One is lured
" by women, anoth"
"er by honors, a "
third by ambitio
"n
or money, and"
 they go over to
 that camp. No i
"ndependent men, "
such as you or 
"I, are left. Wha"
t I say is widen
 the scope of ou
"r society, let t"
he mot d’ordr
e be not virtue 
alone but indepe
ndence and actio

"
Nicholas, who h"
ad left his neph
"ew, irritably pu"
shed up an armch
"air, sat
down i"
"n it, and listen"
"ed to Pierre, co"
ughing disconten
tedly and frowni
ng more and mor
e.  “But act
ion with what ai
m?” he cried. 
“And what posi
tion will you ad
opt toward the 
government?” 
"
“Why, the po"
sition of assist
ants. The societ
y need not be se
cret if the gov
ernment allows i
t. Not merely is
 it not hostile 
"to government, b"
ut it is a soci
ety of true cons
ervatives—a so
ciety of gentlem
en in the full 
meaning of that 
word. It is only
 to prevent some
 Pugachëv or ot
her from killin
g my children an
"d yours, and Ara"
kchéev from sen
ding me off to s

"

“Yes, but i"
t’s a secret s
ociety and there
fore a hostile a
nd harmful one 
which can only c
ause harm.”  
 “Why? Did the
 Tugendbund whic
h saved Europe�
� (they did not 
then venture to

It was not what

to her that was

he had known it 
a long time (it 
seemed so to her
 because she kn
ew that it spran
g from Pierre’
"s whole soul), b"
ut it was his an
imated and enth
usiastic appeara
nce that made he
r glad.  The b
oy with the thin
 neck stretching
 out from the tu
rn-down collar�
�whom everyone 
had forgotten—
gazed at Pierre 
with even greate
r and more rapt
urous joy. Every
 word of Pierre�
��s burned into 
"his heart, and w"

ingers he uncons
ciously broke th
e sealing wax a

It is not at all

"Tugendbund was, "
and what I am pr

"��No, my fwiend!"
 The Tugendbund 
is all vewy well
 for the sausage
" eaters,

don’t understa

t even pwonounce
" it,” interpos"
ed Denísov in 
a loud and resol

 “I’m your m

"re smiled, Natá"
sha began to lau
"gh, but Nicholas"
 knitted his bro
ws still more a
nd began proving
 to Pierre that 
there was no pro
spect of any gr
eat change and t
hat all the dang
er he spoke of e
xisted only in h
is imagination.
 Pierre maintain
"ed the contrary,"
 and as his ment
al faculties we
re greater and m
"ore resourceful,"
 Nicholas felt h
imself cornered.
 This made him 
"still angrier, f"
or he was fully 
"convinced, not b"
y reasoning but
 by something wi
thin him stronge
"r than reason, o"
f the justice of
 his opinion. 
 “I will tell

rvously twitchi

op up his pipe i
"n a corner, but "
finally abandon
ing the attempt.
 “I can’t pr
ove it to you. Y
ou say that eve
rything here is

an overthrow is 
coming: I don’
t see it. But y
ou also say that
 our oath of all

reply: ‘You ar

"
but if you forme

—I know it is

 And if Arakché

 Natásha was th

",

was weak and in

ined her object.
 The conversatio

"�Uncle Pierre, y"
ou... no... If P

Pierre suddenly 
realized what a 
"special, indepen"

cess of thought 
and feeling must
 have been going
 on in this boy
 during that con

emembering all h

"had, however, to"
 give him an an

“Yes,"
" I think so,” "
he said reluctan
"tly, and left th"
e study.  The 
lad looked down 
and seemed now f
or the first tim

 he had done to
 the things on t

shed and went up
 to Nicholas.  
"
“Uncle, forgi"

"“All right, al"

"aid, throwing th"

vidently suppres

  “You ought

   CHAPTER XV
  The conversa
tion at supper w
as not about pol
itics or societi
"es, but
turned "
on the subject N
icholas liked be
st—recollectio
ns of 1812. Den�
�sov started th
ese and Pierre w
as particularly 
agreeable and am
using about the
m. The family se
parated on the m
ost friendly ter
ms.  After sup
"per Nicholas, ha"
ving undressed i
n his study and 
given instructi
ons to the stewa
rd who had been 
"waiting for him,"
 went to the be
droom in his dre
"ssing gown, wher"
e he found his w
ife still at her
"
table, writing"
.  “What are
" you writing, Ma"
ry?” Nicholas 
asked.  Counte
ss Mary blushed.
 She was afraid 
that what she wa
s writing would 
 not be understo
od or approved b
y her husband. 
 She had wanted
 to conceal what
 she was writing
" from him, but a"
t the same time
 was glad he had
 surprised her a
t it and that sh
e would now have
 to tell him. 
"
“A diary, Ni"
"cholas,” she r"
"eplied, handing "
him a blue exerc
ise book filled
" with her firm, "
bold writing.  
 “A diary?” 
Nicholas repeate
d with a shade o
"f irony, and he "
took up the boo
k.  It was in 
French.   Dec
ember 4. Today w
hen Andrúsha (h
er eldest boy) w
oke up he did no
t wish to dress
 and Mademoisell
e Louise sent fo
r me. He was nau
ghty and obstin
ate. I tried thr
"eats, but he onl"
y grew angrier. 
Then I took the 
 matter in hand:
 I left him alon
e and began with
 nurse’s help 
to get the othe
"r children up, t"
elling him that 
I did not love h
im. For a long t
ime he was sile
"nt, as if astoni"
"shed, then he ju"
"mped out of bed,"
 ran to me in h
"is shirt, and so"
bbed so that I c
ould not calm hi
m for a long tim
e. It was plain
 that what troub
led him most was
 that he had gri
eved me. Afterw
ards in the even
ing when I gave 
"him his ticket, "
he again began 
crying piteously
 and kissing me.
 One can do anyt
hing with him by
 tenderness.  
  “What is a 
‘ticket’?”
 Nicholas inquir
ed.  “I have
 begun giving th
e elder ones mar
ks every evening
", showing how
t"
hey have behaved
.”  Nicholas
 looked into the
 radiant eyes th
at were gazing a
"t him, and
cont"
inued to turn ov
er the pages and
 read. In the di
ary was set down
 everything in 
the children’s
 lives that seem
ed noteworthy to
 their mother a
s showing their 
characters or su
ggesting general
 reflections on
 educational met
hods. They were 
for the most par
t quite insignif
"icant
trifles, "
but did not seem
 so to the mothe
r or to the fath
"er either, now
"
that he read thi
s diary about hi
s children for t
he first time. 
 Under the date
 “5” was ent
ered:   Míty
a was naughty at
 table. Papa sai
d he was to have
 no pudding. He 
"had
none, but l"
ooked so unhappi
ly and greedily 
at the others wh
ile they were e
ating! I think t
hat punishment b
y depriving chil
dren of sweets o
nly develops th
eir greediness. 
Must tell Nichol
as this.  Nich
olas put down th
e book and looke
d at his wife. T
he radiant eyes 
 gazed at him qu
estioningly: wou
ld he approve or
 disapprove of h
er diary? There
 could be no dou
bt not only of h
is approval but 
also of his adm
iration for his 
wife.  Perhaps
 it need not be 
done so pedantic
"ally, thought Ni"
"cholas, or even"
"
done at all, bu"
"t this untiring,"
 continual spiri
tual effort of w
hich the sole a
im was the child
ren’s moral we
lfare delighted 
him. Had Nichola
s been able to 
analyze his feel
ings he would ha
ve found that hi
"s steady,
tende"
"r, and proud lov"
e of his wife re
sted on his feel
ing of wonder at
 her spirituali
ty and at the lo
"fty moral world,"
 almost beyond h
"is reach,
in wh"
ich she had her 
being.  He was
 proud of her in
telligence and g
"oodness, recogni"
zed his own ins
ignificance besi
de her in the sp
"iritual world, a"
nd rejoiced all 
the more that s
he with such a s
oul not only bel
onged to him but
 was part of hi
mself.  “I q
"uite, quite appr"
"ove, my dearest!"
” said he with
 a significant l
"ook,
and after "
a short pause he
 added: “And I
 behaved badly t
oday. You weren
’t in the stud
y. We began disp
uting—Pierre a
nd I—and I los
t my temper. Bu
t he is impossib
le: such a child
! I don’t know
 what would bec

"Yes, I know,” "
said Countess Ma

told me.”  �
"��Well, then, yo"

a... Natásha is
 absurd. How she
 rules over him!
 And yet there 
need only be a d
iscussion and sh
e has no words o
f her own but o
nly repeats his 
sayings...” ad
"ded Nicholas, yi"
elding to that 
irresistible inc
lination which t
empts us to judg
e those nearest 
and dearest to 
us. He forgot th
at what he was s
aying about Nat�
�sha could have
 been applied wo
rd for word to h
imself in relati
on to his wife. 
"

“Yes, I hav"
"e noticed that,�"
�� said Countess
 Mary.  “Whe
n I told him tha
t duty and the o
ath were above e
"verything, he
s"
tarted proving g
oodness knows wh
at! A pity you w
ere not there—
what would you 
have said?”  
 “As I see it 
you were quite r
"ight, and I told"
 Natásha so. Pi
erre says every
body is sufferin
"g, tortured, and"
 being corrupted
", and that it
i"
s our duty to he
lp our neighbor.
 Of course he is
" right there,”"
 said Countess 
"Mary, “but he "
forgets that we 
have other dutie
"s nearer to us,"
 duties indicate
d to us by God H
"imself, and that"
 though we might
 expose ourselv
es to risks we m
ust not risk our
 children.”  
"
“Yes, that’"
s it! That’s j
ust what I said 
"to him,” put i"
"n Nicholas, who"
 fancied he real
ly had said it. 
“But they insi
sted on their ow
n view: love of
 one’s neighbo
r and Christiani
ty—and all thi
s in the presenc
e of young Nich
"olas, who had go"
ne into my study
 and broke all m
y things.”  
"“Ah, Nicholas,"
 do you know I a
m often troubled
 about little Ni
"cholas,”
said"
 Countess Mary. 
“He is such an
 exceptional boy
. I am afraid I 
 neglect him in 
favor of my own:
 we all have chi
ldren and relati
ons while he ha
s no one. He is 
constantly alone
 with his though
ts.”  “Wel
"l, I don’t thi"
nk you need repr
oach yourself on
 his account. Al
l that the fond
est mother could
 do for her son 
you have done an
d are doing for 
"
him, and of cou"
rse I am glad of
 it. He is a fin
"e lad, a fine la"
d! This evening
 he listened to 
Pierre in a sort
" of trance, and "
fancy—as we we
re going in to 
supper I looked 
and he had broke
n everything on 
my table to bit
"s, and he told m"
e of it himself 
at once! I never
 knew him to tel
l an untruth. A
" fine lad, a fin"
e lad!” repeat
"ed Nicholas, who"
 at heart was n
ot fond of Nicho
las Bolkónski b
ut was always an
xious to recogni
ze that he was 
a fine lad.  �
"��Still, I am no"
t the same as hi
"s own mother,”"
 said Countess M
ary. “I feel 
I am not the sam
e and it trouble
s me. A wonderfu
"l boy, but I am"
 dreadfully afra
id for him. It w
ould be good for
 him to have com
panions.”  �
��Well it won’
t be for long. N
ext summer I’l
l take him to Pe

sa"
id Nicholas. “
"Yes, Pierre alwa"
ys was a dreamer
 and always will
" be,”
he cont"
"inued, returning"
 to the talk in 
the study which 
had evidently d
isturbed him. �
"�Well, what busi"
ness is it of mi
ne what goes on 
 there—whether
 Arakchéev is b
"ad, and all that"
? What business 
was it of mine 
when I married a
nd was so deep i
n debt that I wa
s threatened wit
"h
prison, and h"
ad a mother who 
could not see or
 understand it? 
And then there 
are you and the 
children and our
 affairs. Is it 
for my own plea
sure that I am a
t the farm or in
 the office from
 morning to nigh
"t?
No, but I kn"
ow I must work t
o comfort my mot
"her, to repay yo"
"u, and not
to l"
eave the childre
n such beggars a
s I was.”  C
ountess Mary wan
ted to tell him 
that man does no
t live by bread 
alone and that 
he attached too 
much importance 
to these matters
. But she knew 
she must not say
 this and that i
t would be usele
ss to do so. She
 only took his 
hand and kissed 
it. He took this
 as a sign of ap
proval and a co
nfirmation of hi
"s thoughts, and "
after a few minu
tes’ reflectio
n continued to 
think aloud.  
"“You know, Mar"
"y, today Elias M"
itrofánych” (
this was his ove
rseer) “came 
back from the Ta
mbóv estate and
 told me they ar
e already offeri
ng eighty thous
and rubles for t
he forest.”  
 And with an eag
er face Nicholas
 began to speak 
of the possibili
ty of repurchas
ing Otrádnoe be
"fore long, and a"
dded: “Another
 ten years of li
fe and I shall 
leave the childr
en... in an exce
llent position.�
��  Countess M
ary listened to 
her husband and 
understood all t
hat he told her
. She knew that 
when he thought 
aloud in this wa
y he would somet
imes ask her wh
at he had been s
"aying, and be ve"
xed if he notice
d that she had 
been thinking ab
out something el
se. But she had 
to force herself
" to
attend, for"
 what he was say
ing did not inte
rest her at all.
 She looked at 
him and did not 
"think, but felt,"
 about something
 different. She 
felt a submissi
ve tender love f
or this man who 
would never unde
rstand all that
" she understood,"
 and this seemed
 to make her lov
e for him still 
 stronger and ad
ded a touch of p
assionate tender
ness. Besides th
is feeling whic
h absorbed her a
ltogether and hi
ndered her from 
following the d
etails of her hu
"sband’s plans,"
 thoughts that h
ad no connection
 with what he w
as saying flitte
d through her mi
nd. She thought 
of her nephew. 
Her husband’s 
account of the b
oy’s agitation
 while Pierre wa
s speaking stru
"ck her forcibly,"
 and various tra
its of his gentl
"e, sensitive
ch"
aracter recurred
 to her mind; an
d while thinking
 of her nephew s
he thought also
 of her own chil
dren. She did no
t compare them w
"ith him, but
co"
mpared her feeli
ng for them with
 her feeling for
" him, and felt
"
with regret that
 there was somet
hing lacking in 
her feeling for 
young Nicholas.
  Sometimes it
 seemed to her t
hat this differe
nce arose from t
he difference i
"n their ages, bu"
t she felt herse
lf to blame towa
rd him and prom
ised in her hear
t to do better a
nd to accomplish
 the impossible�
��in this life 
to love her husb
"and, her childre"
"n, little Nichol"
"as, and all
her"
" neighbors, as C"
hrist loved mank
ind. Countess Ma
ry’s soul alwa
ys strove towar
"d the infinite, "
"the eternal, and"
" the absolute, a"
nd could theref
ore never be at 
peace. A stern e
xpression of the
" lofty, secret
"
suffering of a s
oul burdened by 
the body appeare
d on her face. N
icholas gazed a
t her. “O God!
 What will becom

    CHAPTER X
VI  Natásha a
"nd Pierre, left "
"alone, also bega"
n to talk as onl
y a husband and
" wife can talk, "
"that is, with ex"
traordinary clea
rness and rapidi
"ty,
understandi"
ng and expressin
g each other’s
 thoughts in way
s contrary to a
ll rules of logi
"c, without premi"
"ses, deductions,"
" or conclusions,"
 and in a quite
 peculiar way. N
atásha was so u
sed to this kind
 of talk with he
r husband that 
for her it was t
he surest sign o
f something bein
g wrong between
 them if Pierre 
followed a line 
of logical reaso
ning. When he b
egan proving any
"thing, or talkin"
g argumentativel
y and calmly and
" she,
led on by"
" his example, be"
gan to do the sa
"me, she knew tha"
t they were on 
the verge of a q
uarrel.  From 
the moment they 
were alone and N
atásha came up 
to him with wid
e-open happy eye
"s, and quickly s"
eizing his head 
pressed it to he
"r
bosom, saying"
: “Now you are
" all mine, mine!"
 You won’t esc
ape!”—from t
hat moment this
 conversation be
"gan, contrary to"
 all the laws of
 logic and cont
rary to them bec
ause quite diffe
rent subjects we
re talked about 
at one and the 
same time. This 
simultaneous dis
cussion of many 
topics did not 
prevent a clear 
understanding bu
t on the contrar
y was the surest
 sign that they
 fully understoo
d one another. 
 Just as in a d
ream when all is
" uncertain, unre"
"asoning, and
co"
"ntradictory, exc"
ept the feeling 
that guides the 
"dream, so in thi"
s intercourse c
ontrary to all l
"aws of reason, t"
he words themsel
ves were not co
nsecutive and cl
ear but only the
 feeling that pr
ompted them.  
Natásha spoke t
o Pierre about h
er brother’s l
"ife and doings, "
of how she had 
suffered and lac
ked life during 
"his own absence,"
 and of how she 
 was fonder than
" ever of Mary, a"
nd how Mary was 
in every way bet
ter than hersel
f. In saying thi
s Natásha was s
incere in acknow
ledging Mary’s
"
superiority, b"
ut at the same t
ime by saying it
 she made a dema
nd on Pierre th
"at he should, al"
"l the same, pref"
er her to Mary a
nd to all other
" women, and that"
" now, especially"
 after having se
en many women in
"
Petersburg, he"
 should tell her
 so afresh.  P
"ierre, answering"
 Natásha’s wo
"rds, told her ho"
w intolerable it
 had been for h
im to meet ladie
s at dinners and
 balls in Peters
burg.  “I ha
ve quite lost th
e knack of talki
"ng to ladies,”"
 he said. “It 
was simply dull
". Besides, I was"
 very busy.” 
 Natásha looke
d intently at hi
m and went on: 
 “Mary is so 
"splendid,” she"
 said. “How sh
e understands ch
ildren! It is as
 if she saw str
aight into their
 souls. Yesterda
"y, for instance,"
 Mítya was nau
ghty...”  �
�How like his fa
"ther he is,” P"
ierre interjecte
d.  Natásha k
new why he menti
oned Mítya’s 
likeness to Nich
olas: the recol
lection of his d
ispute with his 
brother-in-law w
as unpleasant an
d he wanted to 
know what Natás
ha thought of it
.  “Nicholas
 has the weaknes
s of never agree
ing with anythin
g not generally 
 accepted. But I
 understand that
 you value what 
opens up a fresh
" line,”
said "
"she, repeating w"
ords Pierre had 
once uttered.  
"
“No, the chie"
f point is that 
to Nicholas idea
s and discussion
s are an amusem
ent—almost a p
"astime,” said "
Pierre. “For i
"nstance, he is
"
collecting a lib
rary and has mad
e it a rule not 
to buy a new boo
k till he has r
ead what he had 
already bought�
�Sismondi and Ro
usseau and Mont
"esquieu,” he a"
dded with a smil
e. “You know h
ow much I...” 
he began to sof
ten down what he
 had said; but N
atásha interrup
ted him to show 
 that this was u
nnecessary.  �
��So you say ide
as are an amusem
ent to him....�
"�

“Yes, and"
 for me nothing 
else is serious.
 All the time in
 Petersburg I s
aw everyone as i
n a dream. When 
I am taken up by
" a thought, all "
else is mere am
usement.”  �
"��Ah, I’m so s"
orry I wasn’t 
there when you m
"et the children,"
” said Natás
ha. “Which was
 most delighted?
" Lisa, I’m sur"
"e.”

“Yes,"
” Pierre repli
"ed, and went on "
with what was in
 his mind. “Ni
cholas says we 
ought not to thi
nk. But I can’
t help it. Besid
"es, when I was i"
n Petersburg I 
felt (I can say 
this to you) tha
t the whole affa
ir would go to 
pieces without m
e—everyone was
 pulling his own
 way. But I succ
eeded in unitin
g them all; and 
then my idea is 
so clear and sim
"ple. You see,
I"
 don’t say tha
t we ought to op
pose this and th
at. We may be mi
staken. What I 
say is: ‘Join 
"hands, you who l"
"ove the right, a"
nd let there be 
but one banner�
��that of active
 virtue.’ Prin
ce Sergéy is a 
fine fellow and 
 clever.”  N
atásha would ha
ve had no doubt 
as to the greatn
ess of Pierre’
"s idea,
but one"
 thing disconcer
ted her. “Can 
a man so importa
nt and necessary
 to society be 
also my husband?
 How did this ha
ppen?” She wis
hed to express 
this doubt to hi
m. “Now who co
uld decide wheth
er he is really 
cleverer than a
ll the others?�
� she asked hers
"elf, and passed "
in review all th
ose whom Pierre
 most respected.
 Judging by what
 he had said the
re was no one h
e had respected 
so highly as Pla
tón Karatáev. 
  “Do you kno
w what I am thin
king about?” s
he asked. “Abo
ut Platón Kara
táev. Would he 
have approved of
" you now, do you"
 think?”  Pi
erre was not at 
all surprised at
 this question. 
He understood hi
s wife’s line
 of thought.  
“Platón Karat
áev?” he repe
"ated, and ponder"
"ed, evidently si"
ncerely trying 
to imagine Karat
áev’s opinion
 on the subject.
 “He would not
 have understoo
d... yet perhaps
 he would.”  
 “I love you a
wfully!” Natá
sha suddenly sai
"d. “Awfully, a"
wfully!”  �
"�No, he would no"
"t have approved,"
"” said Pierre,"
 after reflectio
n. “What he w
ould have approv
ed of is our fam
ily life. He was
 always so anxio
us to find seem
"liness, happines"
"s, and peace in "
"everything, and "
I should have b
een proud to let
 him see us. The
re now—you tal
"k of my absence,"
 but you wouldn
’t believe wha
t a special feel
ing I have for y
ou after a sepa
ration....”  
"
“Yes, I shoul"
d think...” Na
tásha began.  
"
“No, it’s n"
ot that. I never
 leave off lovin
g you. And one c
ouldn’t love 
"more, but this i"
s something spec
"ial.... Yes, of "
course—” he 
did not finish 
because their ey
es meeting said 
the rest.  “
What nonsense it
" is,” Natásha"
 suddenly exclai
"med, “about ho"
"neymoons,
and t"
hat the greatest
 happiness is at
 first! On the c
"ontrary, now is"
 the best of all
. If only you di
d not go away! D
o you remember h
ow we quarreled
? And it was alw
ays my fault. Al
ways mine. And w
hat we quarrele
d about—I don�
��t even remembe
r!”  “Alwa
ys about the sam
"e thing,” said"
 Pierre with a s
mile. “Jealo..
.”  “Don�
�t say it! I can
’t bear it!”
" Natásha cried,"
 and her eyes gl
ittered coldly 
and vindictively
. “Did you see
 her?” she add
"ed, after a paus"
"e.

“No, and"
 if I had I shou
ldn’t have rec
ognized her.” 
  They were sil
ent for a while.
"

“Oh, do yo"
u know? While yo
u were talking i
n the study I wa
s looking at yo
"u,” Natásha b"
"egan, evidently "
anxious to dispe
rse the cloud th
at had come ove
r them. “You a
re as like him a
s two peas—lik
e the boy.” (S
he meant her li
ttle son.) “Oh
", it’s time to"
 go to him.... T
he milk’s com
e.... But I’m 
sorry to leave y
ou.”  They w
ere silent for a
 few seconds. Th
en suddenly turn
ing to one anot
her at the same 
time they both b
egan to speak. P
ierre began with
 self-satisfact
ion and enthusia
"sm, Natásha wit"
"h a quiet, happy"
 smile. Having 
interrupted one 
another they bot
h stopped to let
 the other cont
inue.  “No. 
What did you say
"? Go on, go on.�"
"��

“No, you"
" go on, I was ta"
"lking nonsense,�"
�� said Natásha
.  Pierre fini
shed what he had
 begun. It was t
he sequel to his
 complacent ref
lections on his 
success in Peter
sburg. At that m
oment it seemed 
to him that he 
was chosen to gi
ve a new directi
on to the whole 
of Russian soci
ety and to the w
hole world.  �
��I only wished 
to say that idea
s that have grea
t results are al
ways simple one
s. My whole idea
 is that if vici
ous people are u
nited and const
"itute a power, t"
hen honest folk 
must do the same
. Now that’s s
imple enough.�
�  “Yes.” 
  “And what w
ere you going to
 say?”  “I
? Only nonsense.
”  “But al
l the same?” 
"
“Oh nothing,"
" only a trifle,�"
�� said Natásha
", smiling still "
more brightly. 
“I only wanted
 to tell you abo
ut Pétya: today
 nurse was comin
g to take him f
"rom me, and he l"
"aughed, shut his"
" eyes, and clung"
 to me. I’m su
re he thought h
e was hiding. Aw
fully sweet! The
"re, now he’s c"
"rying. Well,
go"
od-by!” and sh
e left the room.
   Meanwhile 
downstairs in yo
ung Nicholas Bol
kónski’s bedr
oom a little lam
p was burning a
s usual. (The bo
y was afraid of 
the dark and the
y could not cur
e him of it.) De
ssalles slept pr
opped up on four
 pillows and his
 Roman nose emi
tted sounds of r
hythmic snoring.
 Little Nicholas
", who had
just "
waked up in a co
"ld perspiration,"
 sat up in bed a
nd gazed before 
him with wide-o
pen eyes. He had
 awaked from a t
errible dream. H
e had dreamed t
hat he and Uncle
" Pierre, wearing"
 helmets such as
 were depicted i
"n
his Plutarch,"
 were leading a 
huge army. The a
rmy was made up 
of white slanti
ng lines that fi
lled the air lik
e the cobwebs th
at float about i
n autumn and wh
ich Dessalles ca
lled les fils de
 la Vièrge. In 
front was Glory
", which was simi"
lar to those thr
eads but rather 
thicker. He and 
 Pierre were bor
ne along lightly
" and joyously, n"
earer and nearer
 to their goal.
 Suddenly the th
reads that moved
 them began to s
lacken and becom
e entangled and
 it grew difficu
lt to move. And 
Uncle Nicholas s
tood before the
m in a stern and
 threatening att
itude.  “Hav
e you done this?
"” he said, poi"
nting to some br
oken sealing wax
 and pens. “I
" loved you, but "
I have orders fr
om Arakchéev an
d will kill the
 first of you wh
o moves forward.
” Little Nicho
las turned to lo
ok at Pierre bu
t Pierre was no 
longer there. In
 his place was h
is father—Pri
nce Andrew—and
 his father had 
neither shape no
"r form, but he
"
"existed, and whe"
n little Nichola
s perceived him 
he grew faint wi
th love: he fel
t himself powerl
"ess, limp, and f"
ormless. His fat
her caressed and
 pitied him. Bu
t Uncle Nicholas
 came nearer and
 nearer to them.
 Terror seized 
young Nicholas a
nd he awoke.  
“My father!”
 he thought. (Th
ough there were 
two good portrai
ts of Prince An
drew in the hous
"e, Nicholas neve"
r imagined him i
n human form.) �
��My father has
 been with me an
d caressed me. H
e approved of me
 and of Uncle P
ierre. Whatever 
"he may tell me, "
I will do it. Mu
cius Scaevola bu
rned his hand. 
Why should not t
he same sort of 
thing happen to 
me? I know they
 want me to lear
n. And I will le
arn. But someday
 I shall have f
inished learning
", and then I wil"
l do something. 
I only pray God 
that something 
may happen to me
 such as happene
d to Plutarch’
"s men, and I
wi"
ll act as they d
id. I will do be
tter. Everyone s
"hall know me, lo"
"ve me,
and be d"
elighted with me
!” And suddenl
y his bosom heav
ed with sobs and
 he began to cr
y.  “Are you
 ill?” he hear
d Dessalles’ v
oice asking.  
"“No,” answer"
"ed Nicholas, and"
 lay back on his
 pillow.  “H
e is good and ki
nd and I am fond
 of him!” he t
hought of Dessal
les. “But Unc
"le Pierre! Oh, w"
hat a wonderful 
man he is! And m
"y father? Oh,
F"
"ather, Father! Y"
"es, I will do so"
mething with whi
ch even he would
 be satisfied..

 SECOND EPILOGUE
      CHAP
TER I  History
 is the life of 
nations and of h
umanity. To seiz
e and put into 
"words, to descri"
be directly the 
life of humanity
 or even of a si
"ngle
nation, ap"
pears impossible
.  The ancient
 historians all 
employed one and
 the same method
 to describe an
d seize the appa
rently elusive�
�the life of a p
eople. They desc
ribed the activ
ity of individua
ls who ruled the
" people, and reg"
arded the activ
ity of those men
 as representing
 the activity of
 the whole natio
n.  The questi
on: how did indi
viduals make nat
ions act as they
 wished and by 
what was the wil
l of these indiv
iduals themselve
s guided? the an
cients met by r
ecognizing a div
inity which subj
ected the nation
s to the will of
"
a chosen man, "
and guided the w
ill of that chos
en man so as to 
accomplish ends
 that were prede
stined.  For t
he ancients thes
e questions were
 solved by a bel
ief in the direc
t participation
 of the Deity in
 human affairs. 
  Modern histor
"y, in theory, re"
jects both these
 principles.  
It would seem th
at having reject
ed the belief of
 the ancients in
 man’s subjec
tion to the Deit
y and in a prede
termined aim tow
ard which nation
"s
are led, mode"
rn history shoul
d study not the 
manifestations o
f power but the
 causes that pro
duce it. But mod
ern history has 
not done this. H
aving in theory
 rejected the vi
ew held by the a
"ncients, it stil"
l follows them 
in practice.  
Instead of men e
ndowed with divi
ne authority and
 directly guided
 by the will of
" God, modern his"
tory has given u
s either heroes 
endowed with ex
"traordinary, sup"
erhuman capaciti
"es, or simply me"
n of very variou
"s
kinds, from m"
onarchs to journ
"alists, who lead"
 the masses. Ins
tead of the for
mer divinely app
ointed aims of t
"he Jewish, Greek"
", or Roman natio"
"ns,
which ancie"
nt historians re
garded as repres
enting the progr
ess of humanity
", modern history"
 has postulated 
its own aims—t
he welfare of th
"e
French, Germa"
"n, or English pe"
"ople, or, in its"
 highest abstrac
"tion, the
welfa"
re and civilizat
ion of humanity 
"in general, by w"
hich is usually 
 meant that of t
he peoples occup
ying a small nor
thwesterly porti
on of a large c
ontinent.  Mod
ern history has 
rejected the bel
iefs of the anci
ents without re
placing them by 
a new conception
", and the logic "
of the situation
 has obliged th
"e historians, af"
ter they had app
arently rejected
 the divine aut
hority of the ki
ngs and the “f
ate” of the an
"cients, to reach"
 the same concl
usion by another
" road, that is, "
to recognize (1)
 nations guided 
 by individual m
"en, and (2) the "
existence of a k
nown aim to whic
h these nations
 and humanity at
 large are tendi
ng.  At the ba
sis of the works
 of all the mode
rn historians fr
om Gibbon to Bu
"ckle, despite th"
eir seeming disa
greements and th
e apparent novel
ty of their out
"looks, lie those"
" two old, unavoi"
dable assumption
s.  In the fir
st place the his
torian describes
 the activity of
 individuals wh
o in his opinion
 have directed h
umanity (one his
torian considers
"
only monarchs,"
" generals, and m"
inisters as bein
"g such men, whil"
e another inclu
des also orators
", learned men, r"
"eformers, philos"
"ophers, and poet"
"s).
Secondly, i"
t is assumed tha
t the goal towar
d which humanity
 is being led i
s known to the h
istorians: to on
e of them this g
oal is the great
ness of the Rom
"an, Spanish, or "
French realm; to
 another it is l
"iberty, equality"
",
and a certain"
 kind of civiliz
ation of a small
 corner of the w
orld called Eur
ope.  In 1789 
a ferment arises
 in Paris; it gr
"ows, spreads, an"
d is expressed 
by a movement of
 peoples from we
st to east. Seve
ral times it mov
es eastward and
 collides with a
 countermovement
 from the east w
estward. In 181
2 it reaches its
" extreme limit, "
"Moscow, and then"
", with remarkabl"
"e
symmetry, a c"
ountermovement o
ccurs from east 
"to west, attract"
"ing to
it, as t"
he first movemen
"t had done, the "
nations of middl
e Europe. The c
ounter movement 
reaches the star
ting point of th
e first movement
 in the west—
Paris—and subs
ides.  During 
that twenty-year
 period an immen
se number of fie
lds were left u
"ntilled, houses "
"were burned, tra"
de changed its d
"irection, millio"
ns of men migra
"ted, were impove"
"rished, or were "
"enriched, and mi"
llions of Chris
tian men profess
ing the law of l
ove of their fel
lows slew one a
nother.  What 
does all this me
an? Why did it h
appen? What made
 those people bu
rn houses and s
lay their fellow
 men? What were 
the causes of th
ese events? Wha
t force made men
 act so? These a
re the instincti
"ve, plain, and
"
most legitimate 
questions humani
ty asks itself w
hen it encounter
s the monuments
 and tradition o
f that period. 
 For a reply to
 these questions
 the common sens
e of mankind tur
ns to the scien
"ce of history, w"
hose aim is to e
nable nations an
d humanity to kn
ow themselves. 
  If history ha
d retained the c
onception of the
 ancients it wou
ld have said th
"at God, to rewar"
d or punish his 
"people, gave Nap"
oleon power and 
 directed his wi
ll to the fulfil
lment of the div
"ine ends, and th"
at reply would 
have been clear 
and complete. On
e might believe 
or disbelieve i
n the divine sig
nificance of Nap
"oleon, but for a"
nyone believing 
in it there wou
ld have been not
hing unintelligi
ble in the histo
ry of that peri
"od, nor would th"
ere have been an
y contradictions
.  But modern 
history cannot g
ive that reply. 
Science does not
 admit the conc
eption of the an
cients as to the
 direct particip
ation of the Dei
ty in human aff
"airs, and theref"
ore history ough
t to give other 
answers.  Mode
rn history reply
ing to these que
stions says: you
 want to know wh
at this movemen
"t means, what ca"
"used it, and wha"
t force produced
 these events? 
Then listen:  
“Louis XIV was
 a very proud an
d self-confident
 man; he had suc
h and such mist
resses and such 
and such ministe
rs and he ruled 
France badly. Hi
s descendants w
ere weak men and
 they too ruled 
France badly. An
d they had such
 and such favori
tes and such and
 such mistresses
". Moreover, cert"
ain men wrote s
ome books at tha
t time. At the e
nd of the eighte
enth century th
ere were a coupl
e of dozen men i
n Paris who bega
n to talk about 
all men being f
ree and equal. T
his caused peopl
e all over Franc
e to begin to s
lash at and drow
n one another. T
hey killed the k
ing and many oth
er people. At t
hat time there w
as in France a m
an of genius—N
apoleon. He con
quered everybody
 everywhere—th
"at is, he killed"
 many people bec
ause he was a g
reat genius. And
 for some reason
 he went to kill
" Africans, and
"
killed them so w
ell and was so c
unning and wise 
that when he ret
urned to France
 he ordered ever
ybody to obey hi
"m, and they all "
obeyed him. Havi
ng become an Em
peror he again w
ent out to kill 
"people in Italy,"
" Austria,
and P"
russia. And ther
e too he killed 
a great many. In
 Russia there w
"as an Emperor, A"
"lexander, who de"
cided to restore
 order in Europe
 and therefore 
fought against N
apoleon. In 1807
 he suddenly mad
e friends with 
"him, but in 1811"
 they again quar
reled and again 
began killing ma
ny people. Napo
leon led six hun
dred thousand me
n into Russia an
d captured Mosc
ow; then he sudd
enly ran away fr
"om Moscow, and t"
he Emperor Alex
"ander, helped by"
 the advice of S
"tein and others,"
 united Europe t
o arm against t
he disturber of 
its peace. All N
apoleon’s alli
es suddenly bec
ame his enemies 
and their forces
 advanced agains
t the fresh forc
es he raised. T
he Allies defeat
"ed Napoleon, ent"
"ered Paris, forc"
ed Napoleon to 
"abdicate, and se"
nt him to the is
"land of Elba, no"
t depriving him 
of the title of
 Emperor and sho
wing him every r
"espect, though f"
ive years before
 and one year l
ater they all re
garded him as an
 outlaw and a br
igand. Then Lou
"is XVIII, who ti"
ll then had been
 the laughingsto
ck both of the 
French and the A
"llies, began to "
reign. And Napol
"eon, shedding te"
ars before his 
"Old Guards, reno"
unced the throne
 and went into e
xile. Then the 
skillful statesm
en and diplomati
sts (especially 
"Talleyrand, who"
 managed to sit 
down in a partic
ular chair befor
e anyone else an
d thereby exten
ded the frontier
s of France) tal
ked in Vienna an
d by these conv
ersations made t
he nations happy
 or unhappy. Sud
denly the diplo
matists and mona
rchs nearly quar
reled and were o
n the point of 
again ordering t
heir armies to k
"ill one another,"
 but just then N
apoleon arrived
 in France with 
"a battalion, and"
" the French, who"
 had been hating
"
him, immediate"
ly all submitted
 to him. But the
 Allied monarchs
 were angry at 
this and went to
 fight the Frenc
h once more. And
 they defeated 
the genius Napol
"eon and, suddenl"
y recognizing hi
"m as a brigand, "
sent him to the
 island of St. H
elena. And the e
"xile, separated "
from the beloved
 France so dear
" to his heart, d"
ied a lingering 
death on that ro
ck and bequeath
ed his great dee
ds to posterity.
 But in Europe a
 reaction occur
red and the sove
reigns once agai
n all began to o
ppress their su
bjects.”  It
 would be a mist
ake to think tha
t this is ironic
—a caricature 
of the historic
al accounts. On 
the contrary it 
is a very mild e
xpression of th
e contradictory 
"replies, not mee"
ting the questio
"ns, which all th"
e historians gi
"ve, from the com"
pilers of memoir
s and the histor
ies of separate
 states to the w
riters of genera
l histories and 
the new histori
es of the cultur
e of that period
.  The strange
ness and absurdi
ty of these repl
ies arise from t
he fact that mo
"dern history, li"
"ke a deaf man, a"
nswers questions
 no one has aske
d.  If the pur
pose of history 
be to give a des
cription of the 
movement of hum
anity and of the
" peoples, the fi"
rst question—i
n the absence of
 a reply to whi
ch all the rest 
will be incompre
hensible—is: w
hat is the powe
r that moves peo
"ples? To this, m"
odern history la
boriously replie
s either that N
apoleon was a gr
"eat genius, or t"
hat Louis XIV wa
"s very
proud, o"
r that certain w
riters wrote cer
tain books.  A
ll that may be s
o and mankind is
 ready to agree 
"with it, but it "
is not what was
 asked. All that
 would be intere
sting if we reco
gnized a divine 
 power based on 
itself and alway
s consistently d
irecting its nat
ions through Na
"poleons, Louis-e"
"s, and writers; "
but we do not ac
knowledge such 
"a power, and the"
refore before sp
eaking about Nap
"oleons, Louis-es"
", and
authors, "
we ought to be s
hown the connect
ion existing bet
ween these men 
and the movement
 of the nations.
  If instead o
f a divine power
 some other forc
"e has appeared, "
it should be ex
plained in what 
this new force c
"onsists, for the"
 whole interest 
of history lies
 precisely in th
at force.  His
tory seems to as
sume that this f
orce is self-evi
dent and known t
o everyone. But
 in spite of eve
ry desire to reg
"ard it as known,"
 anyone reading
 many historical
 works cannot he
lp doubting whet
her this new fo
"rce, so variousl"
y understood by 
the historians t
"hemselves, is re"
ally quite well
 known to everyb
ody.      
CHAPTER II  Wh
at force moves t
he nations?  B
iographical hist
orians and histo
rians of separat
e nations unders
tand this force
 as a power inhe
rent in heroes a
nd rulers. In th
eir narration e
vents occur sole
ly by the will o
"f a Napoleon, an"
"d Alexander, or "
in general of t
he persons they 
describe. The an
swers given by t
his kind of his
torian to the qu
estion of what f
orce causes even
ts to happen are
 satisfactory o
nly as long as t
here is but one 
historian to eac
h event. As soo
n as historians 
of different nat
ionalities and t
endencies begin 
 to describe the
" same event, the"
 replies they gi
ve immediately l
ose all meaning
", for this force"
 is understood b
y them all not o
nly differently 
 but often in qu
ite contradictor
y ways. One hist
orian says that 
an event was pr
oduced by Napole
"on’s power, an"
other that it wa
s produced by A
"lexander’s, a "
third that it wa
s due to the pow
er of some other
 person. Beside
"s this, historia"
ns of that kind 
contradict each 
other even in t
heir statement a
s to the force o
n which the auth
ority of some p
articular person
 was based. Thie
"rs, a Bonapartis"
"t, says that Nap"
oleon’s power
 was based on hi
s virtue and gen
"ius. Lanfrey, a "
"Republican, says"
 it was based o
n his trickery a
nd deception of 
the people. So t
he historians o
"f this class, by"
 mutually destro
ying one another
"’s positions, "
destroy the und
erstanding of th
e force which pr
"oduces events, a"
nd furnish no r
eply to history�
��s essential qu
estion.  Write
rs of universal 
history who deal
 with all the na
tions seem to r
ecognize how err
oneous is the sp
ecialist histori
ans’ view of t
he force which 
produces events.
 They do not rec
ognize it as a p
ower inherent in
 heroes and rul
"ers, but as the "
resultant of a m
ultiplicity of v
ariously direct
ed forces. In de
scribing a war o
r the subjugatio
"n of a people, a"
 general histor
ian looks for th
e cause of the e
vent not in the 
power of one ma
"n, but in the in"
teraction of man
y persons connec
ted with the ev
ent.  Accordin
g to this view t
he power of hist
orical personage
"s, represented
"
as the product o
"f many forces, c"
"an no longer, it"
" would seem, be "
regarded as a f
orce that itself
 produces events
. Yet in most ca
ses universal h
istorians still 
employ the conce
ption of power a
s a force that i
tself produces 
"events, and trea"
t it as their ca
use. In their ex
"position, an
hi"
storic character
 is first the pr
oduct of his tim
"e, and his power"
 only the resul
tant of various 
"forces, and then"
 his power is it
self a force pr
oducing events. 
"Gervinus, Schlos"
"ser, and others,"
" for instance, a"
t one time prov
e Napoleon to be
 a product of th
"e Revolution, of"
 the ideas of 1
789 and so forth
", and at another"
 plainly say tha
t the campaign o
f 1812 and othe
r things they do
 not like were s
imply the produc
t of Napoleon’
s misdirected w
"ill, and that th"
e very ideas of 
1789 were arrest
ed in their dev
elopment by Napo
leon’s caprice
. The ideas of t
he Revolution an
d the general t
emper of the age
 produced Napole
on’s power. Bu
t Napoleon’s 
power suppressed
 the ideas of th
e Revolution and
 the general tem
per of the age.
  This curious
 contradiction i
s not accidental
. Not only does 
it occur at eve
"ry step, but the"
 universal histo
rians’ account
s are all made u
p of a chain of
 such contradict
ions. This contr
adiction occurs 
because after e
ntering the fiel
d of analysis th
e universal hist
orians stop half
way.  To find 
component forces
 equal to the co
mposite or resul
"tant force, the"
 sum of the comp
onents must equa
l the resultant.
 This condition 
is never observ
ed by the univer
"sal historians, "
and so to explai
n the resultant 
 forces they are
 obliged to admi
"t, in addition t"
o the insufficie
"nt
components, "
another unexplai
ned force affect
ing the resultan
t action.  Spe
cialist historia
ns describing th
e campaign of 18
13 or the restor
ation of the Bo
urbons plainly a
ssert that these
 events were pro
duced by the wi
ll of Alexander.
 But the univers
al historian Ger
"vinus, refuting "
this opinion of
 the specialist 
"historian, tries"
 to prove that t
he campaign of 
1813 and the res
toration of the 
Bourbons were du
e to other thing
s beside Alexan
der’s will—s
uch as the activ
"ity of Stein, Me"
"tternich, Madame"
" de
Staël, Tal"
"leyrand, Fichte,"
" Chateaubriand, "
and others. The 
historian evide
ntly decomposes 
Alexander’s po
wer into the com
ponents: Talleyr
"and,
Chateaubri"
"and, and the res"
t—but the sum 
of the component
"s, that is,
the"
 interactions of
" Chateaubriand, "
"Talleyrand, Mada"
"me de Staël, an"
"d the
others, e"
vidently does no
t equal the resu
"ltant, namely th"
e phenomenon of
 millions of Fre
nchmen submittin
g to the Bourbon
s. That Chateaub
"riand,
Madame d"
"e Staël, and ot"
hers spoke certa
in words to one 
another only af
fected their mut
ual relations bu
t does not accou
nt for the submi
ssion of millio
ns. And therefor
e to explain how
 from these rela
tions of theirs 
 the submission 
of millions of p
eople resulted�
"�that is, how co"
mponent forces 
equal to one A g
ave a resultant 
equal to a thous
and times A—th
e historian is 
again obliged to
 fall back on po
wer—the force 
he had denied�
�and to recogniz
e it as the resu
ltant of the for
"ces, that is, he"
 has to admit a
n unexplained fo
rce acting on th
e resultant. And
 that is just w
hat the universa
"l historians do,"
 and consequentl
y they not only 
 contradict the 
specialist histo
rians but contra
dict themselves.
  Peasants hav
ing no clear ide
a of the cause o
"f rain, say, acc"
ording to wheth
er they want rai
n or fine weathe
r: “The wind h
as blown the clo
"uds
away,” or"
", “The wind ha"
s brought up the
 clouds.” And 
in the same way 
the universal h
istorians someti
"mes, when it ple"
ases them and fi
ts in with thei
"r theory, say th"
at power is the 
result of events
", and sometimes,"
 when they want
 to prove someth
"ing else, say th"
at power produce
s events.  A t
hird class of hi
storians—the s
o-called histori
ans of culture�
��following the 
path laid down b
y the universal 
historians who 
sometimes accept
 writers and lad
ies as forces pr
oducing events�
�again take tha
t force to be so
mething quite di
fferent. They se
e it in what is 
 called culture�
��in mental acti
vity.  The his
torians of cultu
re are quite con
sistent in regar
d to their prog
"enitors, the wri"
ters of universa
"l histories, for"
 if historical 
events may be ex
plained by the f
act that certain
 persons treated
 one another in
 such and such w
"ays, why not exp"
lain them by the
 fact that such
 and such people
 wrote such and 
such books? Of t
he immense numbe
r of indication
s accompanying e
very vital pheno
"menon, these his"
torians select 
the indication o
f intellectual a
ctivity and say 
that this indica
tion is the cau
se. But despite 
their endeavors 
to prove that th
e cause of event
s lies in intel
lectual activity
", only by a grea"
t stretch can on
e admit that th
ere is any conne
ction between in
tellectual activ
ity and the mov
ement of peoples
", and in no case"
 can one admit t
hat intellectual
 activity contr
ols people’s a
"ctions, for that"
 view is not con
firmed by such 
facts as the ver
y cruel murders 
of the French Re
volution resulti
ng from the doc
trine of the equ
"ality of man, or"
 the very cruel 
wars and execut
ions resulting f
rom the preachin
g of love.  Bu
t even admitting
 as correct all 
the cunningly de
vised arguments 
with which thes
e histories are 
filled—admitti
ng that nations 
are governed by 
 some undefined 
force called an 
idea—history�
�s essential que
stion still rem
"ains unanswered,"
 and to the form
er power of mona
rchs and to the 
 influence of ad
visers and other
 people introduc
ed by the univer
"sal
historians,"
" another, newer "
force—the idea
"—is added, the"
 connection of 
which with the m
asses needs expl
anation. It is p
ossible to under
stand that Napo
leon had power a
nd so events occ
urred; with some
 effort one may 
 even conceive t
hat Napoleon tog
ether with other
 influences was 
the cause of an
 event; but how 
"a book, Le Contr"
"at Social, had t"
he effect of mak
ing Frenchmen b
egin to drown on
e another cannot
 be understood w
ithout an expla
nation of the ca
usal nexus of th
is new force wit
h the event.  
Undoubtedly some
 relation exists
 between all who
 live contempora
"neously,
and so"
 it is possible 
to find some con
nection between 
the intellectual
 activity of me
n and their hist
orical movements
", just as such a"
 connection may
 be found betwee
n the movements 
of humanity and 
"commerce,
handi"
"craft, gardening"
", or anything el"
se you please. B
ut why intellect
ual activity is
 considered by t
he historians of
 culture to be t
he cause or exp
ression of the w
hole historical 
movement is hard
 to understand. 
 Only the follow
ing consideratio
ns can have led 
the historians t
o such a conclu
sion: (1) that h
istory is writte
n by learned men
", and so it is
"
natural and agre
eable for them t
o think that the
 activity of the
ir class suppli
es the basis of 
the movement of 
"all humanity, ju"
st as a similar 
 belief is natur
al and agreeable
" to traders, agr"
"iculturists, and"
 soldiers (if t
hey do not expre
"ss it, that is m"
erely because tr
aders and soldie
rs do not write
" history), and ("
2) that spiritua
"l activity, enli"
"ghtenment,
civi"
"lization, cultur"
"e, ideas, are al"
"l indistinct, in"
definite concept
ions under whos
e banner it is v
ery easy to use 
words having a s
till less defin
"ite meaning, and"
 which can there
fore be readily 
introduced into 
any theory.  
But not to speak
 of the intrinsi
c quality of his
tories of this k
ind (which may 
possibly even be
 of use to someo
ne for something
) the histories
" of culture, to "
which all genera
l histories tend
 more and more 
"to approximate, "
are significant 
from the fact th
at after serious
ly and minutely
 examining vario
"us religious, ph"
"ilosophic, and p"
olitical doctri
nes as causes of
" events, as soon"
 as they have to
 describe an ac
tual historic ev
ent such as the 
campaign of 1812
" for instance, t"
hey involuntari
ly describe it a
s resulting from
 an exercise of 
power—and say 
 plainly that th
at was the resul
t of Napoleon’
s will. Speaking
" so, the
histor"
ians of culture 
involuntarily co
ntradict themsel
"ves, and show th"
at the new forc
e they have devi
sed does not acc
ount for what ha
ppens in histor
"y, and that hist"
ory can only be 
explained by int
roducing a power
 which they app
arently do not r
ecognize.    
   CHAPTER III
  A locomotive
 is moving. Some
one asks: “Wha
t moves it?” A
 peasant says t
he devil moves i
t. Another man s
ays the locomoti
ve moves because
 its wheels go 
round. A third a
sserts that the 
cause of its mov
ement lies in t
he smoke which t
he wind carries 
away.  The pea
sant is irrefuta
ble. He has devi
sed a complete e
xplanation. To 
refute him someo
ne would have to
 prove to him th
at there is no d
"evil,
or anothe"
r peasant would 
have to explain 
to him that it i
s not the devil 
"
but a German, w"
ho moves the loc
omotive. Only th
"en, as a result "
of the contradi
"ction, will they"
 see that they a
re both wrong. B
ut the man who 
says that the mo
vement of the wh
eels is the caus
e refutes himsel
"f, for
having o"
nce begun to ana
lyze he ought to
 go on and expla
in further why 
the wheels go ro
und; and till he
 has reached the
 ultimate cause 
of the movement
 of the locomoti
ve in the pressu
re of steam in t
"he boiler, he
h"
as no right to s
top in his searc
h for the cause.
 The man who exp
lains the movem
ent of the locom
otive by the smo
ke that is carri
ed back has not
iced that the wh
eels do not supp
ly an explanatio
n and has taken 
the first sign 
that occurs to h
im and in his tu
rn has offered t
hat as an expla
nation.  The o
nly conception t
hat can explain 
the movement of 
the locomotive i
s that of a for
ce commensurate 
with the movemen
t observed.  T
he only concepti
on that can expl
ain the movement
 of the peoples 
is that of some
 force commensur
ate with the who
le movement of t
he peoples.  Y
et to supply thi
s conception var
ious historians 
take forces of 
"different kinds,"
 all of which ar
e incommensurate
 with the moveme
nt observed. So
me see it as a f
orce directly in
herent in heroes
", as the
peasan"
t sees the devil
 in the locomoti
ve; others as a 
force resulting 
 from several ot
"her forces, like"
 the movement of
 the wheels; oth
ers again as an
 intellectual in
"fluence, like th"
e smoke that is 
blown away.  S
o long as histor
ies are written 
of separate indi
"viduals, whether"
"
Caesars, Alexa"
"nders, Luthers, "
"or Voltaires, an"
d not the histor
"ies
of all, abs"
olutely all thos
e who take part 
"in an event, it "
is quite imposs
ible to describe
 the movement of
 humanity withou
t the conception
 of a force com
pelling men to d
irect their acti
vity toward a ce
rtain end. And 
the only such co
nception known t
o historians is 
that of power. 
 This conceptio
n is the one han
dle by means of 
which the materi
"al of
history, "
as at present ex
"pounded, can be "
"dealt with, and "
anyone who brea
ks that handle o
"ff, as Buckle di"
"d, without findi"
ng some other me
thod of treatin
g historical mat
"erial, merely de"
prives himself o
f the one possi
ble way of deali
ng with it. The 
necessity of the
 conception of 
power as an expl
anation of histo
rical events is 
best demonstrate
d by the univer
sal historians a
nd historians of
 culture themsel
"ves, for they
p"
rofessedly rejec
t that conceptio
n but inevitably
 have recourse t
o it at every s
tep.  In deali
ng with humanity
"’s inquiry, th"
e science of his
tory up to now 
is like money in
 circulation—p
aper money and c
oin. The biograp
hies and specia
l national histo
ries are like pa
per money. They 
can be used and 
 can circulate a
nd fulfill their
 purpose without
 harm to anyone 
and even advant
"ageously, as lon"
g as no one asks
 what is the sec
urity behind the
m. You need onl
y forget to ask 
how the will of 
heroes produces 
"events, and
suc"
h histories as T
hiers’ will be
 interesting and
 instructive and
 may perhaps ev
en possess a tin
ge of poetry. Bu
t just as doubts
 of the real va
lue of paper mon
ey arise either 
"because, being e"
"asy to make, too"
 much of it get
s made or becaus
e people try to 
exchange it for 
"gold, so also
d"
oubts concerning
 the real value 
of such historie
s arise either b
ecause too many
 of them are wri
tten or because 
in his simplicit
y of heart some
one inquires: by
 what force did 
Napoleon do this
"?—that is, wan"
ts to exchange 
the current pape
r money for the 
real gold of act
ual comprehensi
on.  The write
rs of universal 
histories and of
 the history of 
culture are lik
"e people who, re"
cognizing the de
fects of paper m
"oney, decide to"
 substitute for 
it money made of
 metal that has 
not the specific
 gravity of gol
d. It may indeed
 make jingling c
"oin, but will do"
 no more than t
hat. Paper money
 may deceive the
" ignorant, but n"
obody is deceive
d by tokens of 
base metal that 
have no value bu
t merely jingle.
 As gold is gol
d only if it is 
serviceable not 
merely for excha
nge but also for
" use,
so univer"
sal historians w
ill be valuable 
only when they c
an reply to his
tory’s essenti
al question: wha
t is power? The 
universal histor
ians give contr
adictory replies
 to that questio
"n, while the his"
torians of cult
ure evade it and
 answer somethin
g quite differen
t. And as counte
rs of imitation
 gold can be use
d only among a g
roup of people w
ho agree to acc
ept them as gold

   CHAPTER IV
  Having aband
oned the concept
ion of the ancie
nts as to the di
vine subjection
 of the will of 
a nation to some
 chosen man and 
the subjection 
of that man’s 
will to the Deit
"y, history canno"
t without contra
dictions take a
 single step til
l it has chosen 
one of two thing
s: either a retu
rn to the forme
r belief in the 
direct intervent
ion of the Deity
 in human affai
rs or a definite
 explanation of 
the meaning of t
he force produci
ng historical e
vents and termed
 “power.”  
 A return to the
 first is imposs
"ible, the belief"
 has been destro
yed; and so it 
is essential to 
explain what is 
meant by power. 
  Napoleon orde
red an army to b
e raised and go 
to war. We are s
o accustomed to
 that idea and h
ave become so us
ed to it that th
e question: why
 did six hundred
 thousand men go
 to fight when N
apoleon uttered 
"
certain words, "
seems to us sens
eless. He had th
e power and so w
hat he ordered 
was done.  Thi
s reply is quite
 satisfactory if
 we believe that
 the power was g
iven him by God
. But as soon as
 we do not admit
" that, it become"
s essential to 
determine what i
s this power of 
one man over oth
ers.  It canno
t be the direct 
physical power o
f a strong man o
ver a weak one�
�a domination b
ased on the appl
ication or threa
t of physical fo
"rce, like
the p"
ower of Hercules
; nor can it be 
based on the eff
ect of moral for
"ce,
as in their"
 simplicity some
 historians thin
k who say that t
he leading figu
res in history a
"re heroes, that "
"is, men gifted w"
ith a special s
trength of soul 
and mind called 
genius. This pow
er cannot be bas
ed on the predo
minance of moral
" strength, for, "
not to mention h
eroes such as N
apoleon about wh
ose moral qualit
ies opinions dif
"fer widely, hist"
ory shows us th
at neither a Lou
is XI nor a Mett
"ernich, who rule"
d over millions
" of people, had "
any particular m
"oral qualities, "
but on the cont
rary were genera
lly morally weak
er than any of t
he millions they
 ruled over.  
 If the source o
f power lies nei
ther in the phys
ical nor in the 
moral qualities
 of him who poss
"esses it, it mus"
t evidently be l
ooked for elsew
here—in the re
lation to the pe
ople of the man 
who wields the p
ower.  And tha
t is how power i
s understood by 
the science of j
"urisprudence,
t"
hat exchange ban
k of history whi
ch offers to exc
hange history’
s understanding
 of power for tr
ue gold.  Powe
r is the collect
ive will of the 
people transferr
"ed, by expressed"
 or tacit conse
"nt, to their cho"
sen rulers.  I
n the domain of 
"jurisprudence, w"
hich consists of
 discussions of 
how a state and
 power might be 
arranged were it
 possible for al
l that to be ar
"ranged, it is al"
l very clear; bu
t when applied t
o history that 
definition of po
wer needs explan
ation.  The sc
ience of jurispr
udence regards t
he state and pow
er as the ancien
ts regarded fir
"e—namely, as s"
omething existin
g absolutely. Bu
"t for history,
"
the state and po
wer are merely p
"henomena, just a"
s for modern phy
sics fire is no
t an element but
 a phenomenon. 
 From this fund
amental differen
ce between the v
iew held by hist
ory and that he
ld by jurisprude
"nce, it follows "
that jurispruden
ce can tell min
utely how in its
 opinion power s
hould be constit
uted and what p
ower—existing 
immutably outsid
"e time—is, but"
 to history’s 
questions about
 the meaning of 
the mutations of
 power in time i
t can answer no
thing.  If pow
er be the collec
tive will of the
 people transfer
red to their ru
"ler, was Pugach�"
�v a representat
ive of the will 
of the people? I
"f not,
then why"
 was Napoleon I?
 Why was Napoleo
n III a criminal
 when he was ta
ken prisoner at 
"Boulogne, and wh"
"y, later on, wer"
e those criminal
s whom he arres
ted?  Do palac
e revolutions—
in which sometim
es only two or t
hree people take
 part—transfe
r the will of th
e people to a ne
w ruler? In inte
rnational relat
"ions, is the wil"
l of the people 
also transferred
 to their conqu
eror? Was the wi
ll of the Confed
eration of the R
hine transferred
 to Napoleon in
 1806? Was the w
ill of the Russi
an people transf
erred to Napole
"on in 1809, when"
 our army in all
iance with the F
rench went to f
ight the Austria
ns?  To these 
questions three 
answers are poss
ible:  Either 
to assume (1) th
at the will of t
he people is alw
ays uncondition
ally transferred
 to the ruler or
 rulers they hav
"e chosen, and
t"
hat therefore ev
ery emergence of
" a new power, ev"
ery struggle ag
ainst the power 
"once appointed, "
should be absolu
tely regarded as
 an infringemen
t of the real po
wer; or (2) that
 the will of the
 people is tran
sferred to the r
ulers conditiona
"lly, under defin"
ite and known c
"onditions, and t"
o show that all 
"limitations, con"
"flicts, and even"
 destructions o
f power result f
rom a nonobserva
nce by the ruler
s of the condit
ions under which
 their power was
 entrusted to th
em; or (3) that 
 the will of the
 people is deleg
ated to the rule
rs conditionally
", but
that the "
conditions are u
nknown and indef
"inite, and that "
the appearance 
of several autho
"rities, their st"
ruggles and thei
"r falls, result "
solely from the
 greater or less
er fulfillment b
y the rulers of 
these unknown c
onditions on whi
ch the will of t
he people is tra
nsferred from so
me people to ot
hers.  And the
se are the three
 ways in which t
he historians do
 explain the re
lation of the pe
ople to their ru
lers.  Some hi
storians—those
 biographical an
d specialist his
torians already 
 referred to—i
n their simplici
ty failing to un
derstand the que
stion of the me
"aning of power, "
seem to consider
 that the collec
tive will of th
e people is unco
nditionally tran
sferred to histo
"rical persons, a"
nd therefore wh
en describing so
me single state 
they assume that
 particular pow
er to be the one
 absolute and re
"al power, and th"
at any other for
ce opposing thi
s is not a power
 but a violation
 of power—mere
 violence.  Th
"eir theory, suit"
able for primiti
ve and peaceful 
periods of histo
"ry,
has the inc"
onvenience—in 
application to c
omplex and storm
y periods in th
e life of nation
s during which v
arious powers ar
ise simultaneous
ly and struggle
 with one anothe
r—that a Legit
imist historian 
will prove that
 the National Co
"nvention, the Di"
"rectory, and Bon"
aparte were mere
 infringers of 
"the true power, "
while a Republic
an and a Bonapar
tist will prove
: the one that t
he Convention an
d the other that
 the Empire was 
"the
real power,"
 and that all th
e others were vi
olations of powe
r. Evidently th
e explanations f
urnished by thes
e historians bei
ng mutually con
tradictory can o
nly satisfy youn
g children.  R
ecognizing the f
alsity of this v
"iew of history, "
another set of 
historians say t
hat power rests 
on a conditional
 delegation of t
he will of the 
people to their 
"rulers, and that"
 historical lead
ers have power 
only conditional
ly on carrying o
ut the program t
hat the will of 
the people has 
by tacit agreeme
nt prescribed to
 them. But what 
this program co
nsists in these 
historians do no
"t say, or if the"
y do they contin
ually contradic
t one another. 
 Each historian
", according to h"
is view of what 
constitutes a na
tion’s progre
"ss, looks for th"
ese conditions i
"n the greatness,"
" wealth, freedom"
",
or enlightenm"
ent of citizens 
of France or som
e other country.
 But not to men
tion the histori
ans’ contradic
tions as to the 
nature of this 
program—or eve
n admitting that
 some one genera
l program of the
se conditions e
xists—the fact
s of history alm
ost always contr
adict that theo
ry. If the condi
tions under whic
h power is entru
sted consist in 
"the
wealth, fre"
"edom, and enligh"
tenment of the p
"eople, how is it"
 that Louis XIV
 and Iván the T
errible end thei
r reigns tranqui
"lly, while Louis"
 XVI and Charle
s I are executed
 by their people
? To this questi
on historians r
eply that Louis 
XIV’s activity
", contrary to th"
"e program, react"
ed on Louis XVI
. But why did it
 not react on Lo
uis XIV or on Lo
uis XV—why sh
ould it react ju
st on Louis XVI?
 And what is the
 time limit for 
such reactions?
 To these questi
ons there are an
d can be no answ
ers. Equally li
ttle does this v
iew explain why 
for several cent
uries the collec
tive will is no
t withdrawn from
 certain rulers 
"and their heirs,"
 and then sudde
nly during a per
iod of fifty yea
rs is transferre
d to the Conven
"tion, to the Dir"
"ectory, to Napol"
"eon, to Alexande"
"r, to Louis XVII"
"I,
to Napoleon "
"again, to Charle"
"s X, to Louis Ph"
"ilippe, to a Rep"
ublican governm
"ent, and to Napo"
leon III. When e
xplaining these 
rapid transfers 
 of the people�
�s will from one
 individual to a
"nother, especial"
ly in view of i
nternational rel
"ations, conquest"
"s, and alliances"
", the historians"
 are obliged to
 admit that some
 of these transf
ers are not norm
al delegations 
of the people’
s will but are a
ccidents depende
"nt on cunning, o"
"n
mistakes, on "
"craft, or on the"
 weakness of a d
"iplomatist, a ru"
"ler, or a
party"
 leader. So that
 the greater par
t of the events 
of history—civ
"il
wars, revolu"
"tions, and conqu"
ests—are prese
nted by these hi
storians not as
 the results of 
free transferenc
es of the people
"’s will, but a"
s results of th
e ill-directed w
ill of one or mo
"re individuals, "
"that is,
once a"
"gain, as usurpat"
ions of power. A
nd so these hist
orians also see 
 and admit histo
rical events whi
ch are exception
s to the theory.
  These histor
ians resemble a 
"botanist who, ha"
ving noticed tha
t some plants g
row from seeds p
roducing two cot
"yledons, should "
insist that all 
 that grows does
 so by sprouting
 into two leaves
", and that the p"
"alm, the
mushro"
"om, and even the"
" oak, which blos"
som into full gr
owth and no long
er resemble two
" leaves, are dev"
iations from the
 theory.  Hist
orians of the th
ird class assume
 that the will o
f the people is
 transferred to 
historic persona
ges conditionall
"y, but that the"
 conditions are 
unknown to us. T
hey say that his
torical personag
es have power o
nly because they
 fulfill the wil
l of the people 
which has been 
delegated to the
m.  But in tha
"t case, if the f"
orce that moves 
nations lies not
 in the histori
c leaders but in
 the nations the
"mselves, what si"
gnificance have 
 those leaders? 
"

The leaders, "
these historians
" tell us, expres"
s the will of th
e people: the a
ctivity of the l
eaders represent
s the activity o
f the people.  
 But in that cas
e the question a
rises whether al
l the activity o
f the leaders s
erves as an expr
ession of the pe
ople’s will or
 only some part 
 of it. If the w
hole activity of
 the leaders ser
ves as the expre
ssion of the pe
"ople’s will, a"
s some historian
"s suppose, then "
all the details 
 of the court sc
andals contained
 in the biograph
ies of a Napoleo
n or a Catherin
e serve to expre
ss the life of t
"he nation, which"
 is evident non
sense; but if it
 is only some pa
rticular side of
 the activity of
 an historical 
leader which ser
ves to express t
he people’s li
"fe, as other
so"
-called “philo
sophical” hist
"orians believe, "
then to determin
e which side of
 the activity of
 a leader expres
ses the nation�
"�s life, we have"
 first of all t
o know in what t
he nation’s li
fe consists.  
Met by this diff
iculty historian
s of that class 
devise some most
"
obscure, impal"
"pable, and gener"
al abstraction w
hich can cover a
ll conceivable 
"occurrences, and"
 declare this ab
straction to be 
the aim of huma
nity’s movemen
t. The most usua
l generalization
s adopted by alm
ost all the his
torians are: fre
"edom, equality, "
"enlightenment, p"
"rogress,
civili"
"zation, and cult"
ure. Postulating
 some generaliza
tion as the goal
 of the movemen
"t of humanity, t"
he historians st
udy the men of w
hom the greates
t number of monu
ments have remai
"ned: kings, mini"
"sters, generals,"
"
authors, refor"
"mers, popes, and"
" journalists, to"
 the extent to w
hich in their o
pinion these per
sons have promot
ed or hindered t
hat abstraction.
 But as it is i
n no way proved 
that the aim of 
humanity does co
nsist in freedo
"m, equality, enl"
"ightenment, or c"
"ivilization, and"
 as the connecti
on of the peopl
e with the ruler
s and enlightene
rs of humanity i
s only based on
 the arbitrary a
ssumption that t
he collective wi
ll of the people
 is always tran
sferred to the m
en whom we have 
"noticed, it happ"
ens that the ac
tivity of the mi
llions who migra
"te, burn houses,"
 abandon agricul
"ture,
and destr"
oy one another n
ever is expresse
d in the account
 of the activit
y of some dozen 
people who did n
"ot burn houses, "
practice agricu
"lture, or slay t"
heir fellow crea
tures.  Histor
y proves this at
 every turn. Is 
the ferment of t
he peoples of t
he west at the e
nd of the eighte
enth century and
 their drive eas
tward explained
 by the activity
" of Louis XIV, X"
"V, and XVI, thei"
r mistresses an
"d ministers, and"
 by the lives of
" Napoleon, Rouss"
"eau, Diderot,
B"
"eaumarchais, and"
 others?  Is t
he movement of t
he Russian peopl
e eastward to Ka
zán and Siberia
 expressed by d
etails of the mo
rbid character o
f Iván the Terr
ible and by his
 correspondence 
with Kúrbski? 
 Is the movemen
t of the peoples
 at the time of 
the Crusades exp
lained by the l
ife and activity
 of the Godfreys
 and the Louis-e
s and their ladi
es? For us that
 movement of the
 peoples from we
"st to east, with"
"out
leaders, wi"
th a crowd of va
"grants, and with"
 Peter the Hermi
"t, remains
inco"
mprehensible. An
d yet more incom
prehensible is t
he cessation of 
that movement w
hen a rational a
nd sacred aim fo
r the Crusade—
the deliverance 
 of Jerusalem—
had been clearly
 defined by hist
oric leaders. Po
"pes, kings,
and"
 knights incited
 the peoples to 
free the Holy La
nd; but the peop
"le
did not go, "
for the unknown 
cause which had 
previously impel
led them to go 
no longer existe
d. The history o
f the Godfreys a
nd the Minnesing
ers can evident
ly not cover the
 life of the peo
ples. And the hi
story of the Go
dfreys and the M
innesingers has 
remained the his
tory of Godfreys
 and Minnesinge
"rs, but the hist"
ory of the life 
of the peoples a
nd their impuls
es has remained 
unknown.  Stil
l less does the 
history of autho
rs and reformers
 explain to us t
he life of the 
peoples.  The 
history of cultu
re explains to u
s the impulses a
nd conditions of
 life and thoug
ht of a writer o
r a reformer. We
 learn that Luth
er had a hot te
mper and said su
ch and such thin
gs; we learn tha
t Rousseau was 
suspicious and w
rote such and su
ch books; but we
 do not learn wh
y after the Ref
ormation the peo
ples massacred o
"ne another, nor "
why during the 
French Revolutio
n they guillotin
ed one another. 
  If we unite b
oth these kinds 
"of history, as i"
s done by the ne
west historians
", we shall have "
the history of m
onarchs and writ
"ers, but not
th"
e history of the
 life of the peo
ples.      
 CHAPTER V  Th
e life of the na
tions is not con
tained in the li
ves of a few men
", for
the conne"
ction between th
ose men and the 
nations has not 
been found. The
 theory that thi
s connection is 
based on the tra
nsference of the
 collective wil
l of a people to
 certain histori
cal personages i
s an hypothesis
 unconfirmed by 
the experience o
f history.  Th
e theory of the 
transference of 
the collective w
ill of the peopl
e to historic p
ersons may perha
ps explain much 
in the domain of
 jurisprudence 
and be essential
 for its purpose
"s, but in its ap"
plication to his
"tory, as
soon a"
"s revolutions, c"
"onquests, or civ"
il wars occur—
"that is, as soon"
 as history beg
ins—that theor
y explains nothi
ng.  The theor
y seems irrefuta
ble just because
 the act of tran
sference of the 
 people’s will
 cannot be verif
"ied, for it neve"
r occurred.  W
hatever happens 
and whoever may 
stand at the hea
"d of affairs, th"
e theory can al
ways say that su
ch and such a pe
rson took the le
ad because the 
collective will 
was transferred 
to him.  The r
eplies this theo
ry gives to hist
orical questions
 are like the r
eplies of a man 
"who, watching th"
e movements of a
 herd of cattle 
and paying no a
ttention to the 
varying quality 
of the pasturage
 in different p
arts of the fiel
"d, or to the dri"
ving of the herd
"sman, should att"
ribute the dire
ction the herd t
akes to what ani
mal happens to b
e at its head. 
 “The herd go
es in that direc
tion because the
 animal in front
 leads it and t
he collective wi
ll of all the ot
her animals is v
ested in that l
eader.” This i
s what historian
s of the first c
lass say—those
 who assume the
 unconditional t
ransference of t
he people’s wi
ll.  “If the
 animals leading
 the herd change
", this happens b"
ecause the coll
ective will of a
ll the animals i
s transferred fr
om one leader to
"
another, accor"
ding to whether 
the animal is or
 is not leading 
them in the dir
ection selected 
by the whole her
d.” Such is th
e reply historia
ns who assume t
hat the collecti
ve will of the p
eople is delegat
ed to rulers un
der conditions w
hich they regard
 as known. (With
 this method of
 observation it 
often happens th
"at the observer,"
 influenced by t
he direction he
 himself prefers
", regards those "
"as leaders who, "
owing to the pe
ople’s change 
"of direction, ar"
e no longer in f
"ront, but on one"
" side,
or even "
in the rear.)  
 “If the anima
ls in front are 
continually chan
ging and the dir
ection of the w
hole herd is con
"stantly altered,"
 this is because
 in order to fol
low a given dir
ection the anima
ls transfer thei
r will to the an
imals that have
 attracted our a
"ttention, and to"
 study the movem
ents of the herd
 we must watch 
the movements of
 all the promine
nt animals movin
g on all sides 
of the herd.” 
So say the third
 class of histor
ians who regard 
all historical 
"persons, from mo"
narchs to journa
"lists, as the ex"
pression of the
ir age.  The t
heory of the tra
nsference of the
 will of the peo
ple to historic 
 persons is mere
ly a paraphrase�
��a restatement 
of the question 
in other words.
  What causes 
historical event
s? Power. What i
s power? Power i
s the collectiv
e will of the pe
ople transferred
 to one person. 
Under what cond
ition is the wil
l of the people 
delegated to one
 person? On con
dition that that
 person expresse
s the will of th
e whole people. 
"That
is, power "
is power: in oth
"er words, power "
is a word the me
aning of which 
we do not unders
tand.  If the 
realm of human k
nowledge were co
nfined to abstra
"ct reasoning,
t"
hen having subje
cted to criticis
m the explanatio
n of “power”
 that juridical
 science gives u
"s, humanity woul"
d conclude that 
power is merely 
 a word and has 
no real existenc
e. But to unders
tand phenomena m
"an
has, besides"
 abstract reason
"ing, experience "
by which he veri
fies his reflec
tions. And exper
ience tells us t
hat power is not
 merely a word b
ut an actually 
existing phenome
non.  Not to s
peak of the fact
 that no descrip
tion of the coll
ective activity 
 of men can do w
ithout the conce
"ption of power, "
the existence of
 power is prove
d both by histor
y and by observi
ng contemporary 
events.  Whene
ver an event occ
urs a man appear
"s or men appear,"
 by whose will t
he event seems 
to have taken pl
ace. Napoleon II
I issues a decre
e and the Frenc
h go to Mexico. 
The King of Prus
sia and Bismarck
 issue decrees a
nd an army ente
rs Bohemia. Napo
leon I issues a 
decree and an ar
my enters Russi
a. Alexander I g
ives a command a
nd the French su
bmit to the Bou
rbons. Experienc
e shows us that 
whatever event o
ccurs it is alwa
ys related to t
he will of one o
r of several men
 who have decree
d it.  The his
"torians, in acco"
rd with the old 
habit of acknowl
edging divine i
ntervention in h
"uman affairs, wa"
nt to see the ca
use of events in
 the expression
 of the will of 
someone endowed 
"with power, but "
that suppositio
n is not confirm
ed either by rea
son or by experi
ence.  On the 
one side reflect
ion shows that t
he expression of
 a man’s will�
��his words—a
re only part of 
the general acti
vity expressed i
"n an event,
as "
for instance in 
a war or a revol
"ution, and so wi"
thout assuming a
n incomprehensi
"ble, supernatura"
l force—a mira
cle—one cannot
 admit that wor
ds can be the im
mediate cause of
 the movements o
f millions of me
n. On the other
" hand, even if w"
e admitted that 
words could be t
he cause of eve
"nts, history sho"
ws that the expr
ession of the wi
ll of historical
 personages doe
s not in most ca
ses produce any 
"effect, that is "
"to say,
their c"
ommands are ofte
"n not executed, "
and sometimes th
e very opposite 
 of what they or
der occurs.  W
ithout admitting
 divine interven
tion in the affa
irs of humanity 
we cannot regar
d “power” as
 the cause of ev
"ents.

Power, "
from the standpo
int of experienc
"e, is merely the"
 relation that 
exists between t
he expression of
 someone’s wil
l and the execut
ion of that wil
l by others.  
To explain the c
onditions of tha
t relationship w
e must first est
ablish a concep
tion of the expr
"ession of will, "
referring it to 
man and not to t
he Deity.  If
 the Deity issue
"s a command, exp"
"resses His will,"
 as ancient hist
"ory
tells us, t"
he expression of
 that will is in
dependent of tim
e and is not ca
used by anything
", for the Divini"
ty is not contro
lled by an event
. But speaking 
of commands that
 are the express
ion of the will 
of men acting i
n time and in re
lation to one an
"other, to explai"
n the connection
 of commands wi
th events we mus
t restore: (1) t
he condition of 
all that takes 
place: the conti
nuity of movemen
t in time both o
f the events and
 of the person 
"who commands, an"
d (2) the inevit
ability of the c
onnection betwe
en the person co
mmanding and tho
se who execute h
is command.   
    CHAPTER V
I  Only the ex
pression of the 
will of the Deit
"y, not dependent"
" on time, can
r"
elate to a whole
 series of event
s occurring over
 a period of yea
rs or centuries
", and only the D"
"eity, independen"
"t of everything,"
 can by His sol
e will determine
 the direction o
f humanity’s m
ovement; but man
 acts in time a
nd himself takes
 part in what oc
curs.  Reinsta
ting the first c
ondition omitted
", that of time, "
we see that no 
command can be e
xecuted without 
some preceding o
rder having been
 given renderin
g the execution 
of the last comm
and possible.  
 No command ever
 appears spontan
"eously, or itsel"
f covers a whole
 series of occu
rrences; but eac
h command follow
"s from another, "
and never refers
 to a whole ser
ies of events bu
t always to one 
moment only of a
n event.  When
", for instance, "
we say that Napo
leon ordered arm
ies to go to war
",
we combine in"
 one simultaneou
s expression a w
hole series of c
onsecutive comm
ands dependent o
ne on another. N
apoleon could no
t have commanded
 an invasion of
 Russia and neve
r did so. Today 
he ordered such 
and such papers
 to be written t
"o Vienna, to Ber"
"lin, and to Pete"
rsburg; tomorro
w such and such 
decrees and orde
"rs to the army, "
"the fleet, the
"
"commissariat, an"
d so on and so o
n—millions of 
"commands, which "
formed a whole 
series correspon
ding to a series
 of events which
 brought the Fr
ench armies into
 Russia.  If t
hroughout his re
ign Napoleon gav
e commands conce
rning an invasio
n of England an
d expended on no
 other undertaki
ng so much time 
"and effort,
and"
 yet during his 
whole reign neve
r once attempted
 to execute that
 design but und
ertook an expedi
tion into Russia
", with which cou"
ntry he conside
red it desirable
 to be in allian
ce (a conviction
 he repeatedly 
expressed)—thi
s came about bec
ause his command
s did not corres
pond to the cou
rse of events in
" the first case,"
 but did so corr
espond in the l
atter.  For an
 order to be cer
"tainly executed,"
 it is necessary
 that a man shou
ld order what c
an be executed. 
But to know what
 can and what ca
nnot be execute
"d is impossible,"
 not only in the
 case of Napoleo
n’s invasion o
f Russia in whi
ch millions part
"icipated, but ev"
en in the simple
"st event,
for i"
n either case mi
llions of obstac
les may arise to
 prevent its ex
ecution. Every o
rder executed is
 always one of a
n immense number
 unexecuted. Al
l the impossible
 orders inconsis
tent with the co
urse of events 
remain unexecute
d. Only the poss
ible ones get li
nked up with a 
consecutive seri
es of commands c
orresponding to 
a series of even
"ts, and
are exe"
cuted.  Our fa
lse conception t
hat an event is 
caused by a comm
and which preced
es it is due to
 the fact that w
hen the event ha
s taken place an
d out of thousa
nds of others th
ose few commands
 which were cons
istent with that
 event have bee
"n executed, we f"
orget about the 
others that were
 not executed b
ecause they coul
d not be. Apart 
"from that, the c"
hief source of 
our error in thi
s matter is due 
to the fact that
 in the historic
al accounts a w
hole series of i
"nnumerable, dive"
"rse, and petty e"
"vents, such
for"
 instance as all
 those which led
 the French armi
"es to Russia, is"
 generalized in
to one event in 
accord with the 
result produced 
by that series 
"of events, and c"
orresponding wit
h this generaliz
ation the whole 
 series of comma
nds is also gene
ralized into a s
ingle expression
 of will.  We 
say that Napoleo
n wished to inva
de Russia and in
vaded it. In re
ality in all Nap
oleon’s activi
ty we never find
 anything resemb
ling an express
ion of that wish
", but find a ser"
"ies of orders, o"
r expressions of
"
his will, very"
 variously and i
ndefinitely dire
cted. Amid a lon
g series of une
xecuted orders o
f Napoleon’s o
"ne series, for t"
he campaign of 1
"812,
was carrie"
d out—not beca
use those orders
 differed in any
 way from the o
"ther, unexecuted"
 orders but beca
use they coincid
ed with the cour
se of events th
at led the Frenc
h army into Russ
ia; just as in s
tencil work thi
s or that figure
 comes out not b
ecause the color
 was laid on fro
m this side or 
"in that way, but"
 because it was 
laid on from all
 sides over the
 figure cut in t
he stencil.  S
o that examining
 the relation in
 time of the com
mands to the eve
"nts,
we find th"
at a command can
 never be the ca
use of the event
", but that a
ce"
rtain definite d
ependence exists
 between the two
.  To understa
nd in what this 
dependence consi
sts it is necess
ary to reinstat
e another omitte
d condition of e
very command pro
ceeding not from
 the Deity but 
"from a man, whic"
"h is, that the m"
an who gives the
 command himsel
f takes part in 
the event.  Th
is relation of t
he commander to 
those he command
s is just what i
s called power.
 This relation c
onsists in the f
ollowing:  For
 common action p
eople always uni
te in certain co
"mbinations, in w"
hich regardless
 of the differen
ce of the aims s
et for the commo
"n action, the
r"
elation between 
those taking par
t in it is alway
s the same.  M
en uniting in th
ese combinations
 always assume s
uch relations to
ward one anothe
r that the large
r number take a 
more direct shar
"e, and the
smal"
ler number a les
"s direct share, "
in the collectiv
e action for whi
ch they have co
mbined.  Of al
l the combinatio
ns in which men 
unite for collec
tive action one 
of the most str
iking and defini
te examples is a
n army.  Every
 army is compose
d of lower grade
s of the service
—the rank and 
 file—of whom 
there are always
 the greatest nu
mber; of the nex
t higher milita
ry rank—corpor
als and noncommi
ssioned officers
 of whom there a
"re
fewer, and o"
f still-higher o
fficers of whom 
there are still 
"fewer,
and so o"
n to the highest
 military comman
d which is conce
ntrated in one 
person.  A mil
itary organizati
on may be quite 
correctly compar
"ed to a cone, of"
 which the base
 with the larges
t diameter consi
sts of the rank 
and file; the n
ext higher and s
maller section o
f the cone consi
sts of the next 
 higher grades o
"f the army, and "
so on to the ape
"x, the point of "
which will repr
esent the comman
der in chief.  
"
The soldiers, o"
f whom there are
" the most, form "
the lower sectio
n of the cone a
nd its base. The
 soldier himself
 does the stabbi
"ng, hacking,
bu"
"rning, and pilla"
"ging, and always"
 receives orders
 for these actio
ns from men abo
ve him; he himse
lf never gives a
n order. The non
commissioned of
ficers (of whom 
there are fewer)
 perform the act
ion itself less 
 frequently than
" the soldiers, b"
ut they already 
give commands. A
n officer still
 less often acts
 directly himsel
"f, but commands "
still more freq
uently. A genera
l does nothing b
ut command the t
"roops, indicates"
" the
objective,"
 and hardly ever
 uses a weapon h
imself. The comm
ander in chief 
never takes dire
ct part in the a
"ction itself, bu"
t only gives gen
eral orders con
cerning the move
ment of the mass
 of the troops. 
A similar relat
ion of people to
 one another is 
seen in every co
mbination of men
 for common act
ivity—in agric
"ulture, trade, a"
nd every adminis
tration.  And 
so without parti
cularly analyzin
g all the contig
uous sections of
 a cone and of 
the ranks of an 
"army, or the ran"
ks and positions
 in any adminis
trative or publi
c business whate
ver from the low
est to the high
"est, we see a la"
"w by which men, "
to take associat
"ed action, combi"
ne in such rela
tions that the m
ore directly the
y participate in
 performing the
 action the less
 they can comman
d and the more n
umerous they are
",
while the les"
s their direct p
articipation in 
the action itsel
"f, the more
the"
y command and th
e fewer of them 
there are; risin
g in this way fr
om the lowest r
anks to the man 
"at the top, who "
takes the least 
direct share in
 the action and 
directs his acti
vity chiefly to 
commanding.  T
his relation of 
the men who comm
and to those the
y command is wha
t constitutes t
he essence of th
e conception cal
led power.  Ha
ving restored th
e condition of t
ime under which 
all events occur
",
we find that "
a command is exe
cuted only when 
it is related to
 a correspondin
g series of even
ts. Restoring th
e essential cond
ition of relati
on between those
 who command and
 those who execu
"te, we find that"
 by the very na
ture of the case
 those who comma
nd take the smal
lest part in th
e action itself 
and that their a
ctivity is exclu
sively directed 
to commanding. 
      CHAPT
ER VII  When a
n event is takin
g place people e
xpress their opi
nions and wishes
"
about it, and "
as the event res
ults from the co
llective activit
y of many peopl
"e, some one of t"
he opinions or w
ishes expressed 
is sure to be f
ulfilled if but 
approximately. W
hen one of the o
pinions expresse
"d
is fulfilled,"
 that opinion ge
ts connected wit
h the event as a
 command preced
ing it.  Men a
re hauling a log
. Each of them e
xpresses his opi
nion as to how a
nd where to hau
l it. They haul 
"the log away, an"
d it happens tha
t this is done 
as one of them s
aid. He ordered 
it. There we hav
e command and po
wer in their pr
imary form. The 
man who worked m
ost with his han
ds could not th
ink so much abou
t what he was do
"ing, or reflect "
on or command wh
at would result
 from the common
 activity; while
 the man who com
manded more wou
ld evidently wor
k less with his 
hands on account
 of his greater 
 verbal activity
.  When some l
arger concourse 
of men direct th
eir activity to 
a common aim th
ere is a yet sha
rper division of
" those who, beca"
use their activi
ty is given to 
directing and co
"mmanding, take l"
ess part in the 
direct work.  
When a man works
 alone he always
 has a certain s
et of reflection
s which as it s
eems to him dire
cted his past ac
"tivity, justify "
his present act
"ivity, and guide"
 him in planning
 his future acti
ons. Just the sa
me is done by a
 concourse of pe
"ople, allowing t"
hose who do not 
take a direct p
art in the activ
ity to devise co
"nsiderations, ju"
"stifications, an"
d surmises conc
erning their col
lective activity
.  For reasons
 known or unknow
n to us the Fren
ch began to drow
n and kill one 
another. And cor
responding to th
e event its just
ification appear
s in people’s
 belief that thi
s was necessary 
for the welfare 
"of France, for
"
"liberty, and for"
 equality. Peopl
e ceased to kill
" one another, an"
d this event wa
s accompanied by
 its justificati
on in the necess
ity for a centr
alization of pow
"er, resistance t"
"o Europe, and so"
 on. Men went f
rom the west to 
the east killing
 their fellow me
"n, and the event"
 was accompanie
d by phrases abo
ut the glory of 
"France, the base"
ness of England
", and so on. His"
tory shows us th
at these justifi
cations of the 
events have no c
ommon sense and 
are all contradi
"ctory, as in the"
 case of killin
g a man as the r
esult of recogni
"zing his rights,"
 and the killing
 of millions in
 Russia for the 
humiliation of E
ngland. But thes
e justification
s have a very ne
cessary signific
ance in their ow
n day.  These 
justifications r
elease those who
 produce the eve
nts from moral 
responsibility. 
These temporary 
aims are like th
e broom fixed in
 front of a loc
omotive to clear
 the snow from t
he rails in fron
t: they clear m
en’s moral res
ponsibilities fr
om their path. 
 Without such j
ustification the
re would be no r
eply to the simp
lest question t
hat presents its
elf when examini
ng each historic
al event. How i
s it that millio
ns of men commit
 collective crim
"es—make war, c"
"ommit
murder, a"
nd so on?  Wit
h the present co
mplex forms of p
olitical and soc
ial life in Euro
pe can any even
t that is not pr
"escribed, decree"
"d, or ordered by"
" monarchs,
mini"
"sters, parliamen"
"ts, or newspaper"
s be imagined? I
s there any col
lective action w
hich cannot find
 its justificati
on in political 
"
unity, in patri"
"otism, in the ba"
"lance of power, "
or in civilizati
on? So that eve
ry event that oc
curs inevitably 
coincides with s
ome expressed w
"ish and, receivi"
ng a justificati
"on, presents its"
elf as the resul
t of the will o
f one man or of 
several men.  
In whatever dire
ction a ship mov
"es, the flow of "
the waves it cut
s will always b
e noticeable ahe
ad of it. To tho
se on board the 
ship the moveme
nt of those wave
s will be the on
ly perceptible m
otion.  Only b
y watching close
ly moment by mom
ent the movement
 of that flow an
d comparing it 
with the movemen
t of the ship do
 we convince our
selves that eve
ry bit of it is 
occasioned by th
e forward moveme
"nt of the ship,"
 and that we wer
e led into error
 by the fact tha
t we ourselves w
ere imperceptib
ly moving.  We
 see the same if
 we watch moment
 by moment the m
ovement of histo
rical character
"s (that is, re-e"
stablish the ine
vitable conditio
n of all that o
ccurs—the cont
inuity of moveme
nt in time) and 
do not lose sigh
t of the essent
ial connection o
f historical per
sons with the ma
sses.  When th
e ship moves in 
one direction th
ere is one and t
he same wave ah
"ead of it, when "
it turns frequen
tly the wave ahe
ad of it also tu
rns frequently.
 But wherever it
 may turn there 
always will be t
he wave anticip
ating its moveme
nt.  Whatever 
happens it alway
s appears that j
ust that event w
as foreseen and
 decreed. Wherev
er the ship may 
"go, the rush of "
water which neit
her directs nor
 increases its m
ovement foams ah
"ead of it, and a"
t a distance se
ems to us not me
rely to move of 
itself but to go
vern the ship’
s movement also
.  Examining o
nly those expres
sions of the wil
l of historical 
"persons
which, "
"as commands, wer"
e related to eve
"nts, historians "
have assumed th
at the events de
pended on those 
commands. But ex
amining the even
ts themselves a
nd the connectio
n in which the h
istorical person
s stood to the 
"people, we have "
found that they 
and their orders
 were dependent 
on events. The 
incontestable pr
oof of this dedu
"ction is that, h"
owever many com
mands were issue
"d, the event doe"
s not take place
 unless there ar
e other causes 
"for it, but as s"
oon as an event 
occurs—be it w
hat it may—th
en out of all th
e continually ex
pressed wishes o
f different peop
le some will al
ways be found wh
ich by their mea
ning and their t
ime of utteranc
e are related as
 commands to the
 events.  Arri
ving at this con
clusion we can r
eply directly an
d positively to 
 these two essen
tial questions o
f history:  (1
) What is power?
  (2) What for
ce produces the 
movement of the 
nations?  (1) 
Power is the rel
ation of a given
 person to other
" individuals,
i"
n which the more
 this person exp
"resses opinions,"
" predictions, an"
d justification
s of the collect
ive action that 
"is performed, th"
e less is his p
articipation in 
that action.  
(2) The movement
 of nations is c
aused not by pow
"er, nor by intel"
lectual activit
"y, nor even by a"
 combination of 
the two as histo
rians have supp
"osed, but by the"
 activity of all
 the people who 
participate in 
"the events, and "
who always combi
ne in such a way
 that those taki
ng the largest 
direct share in 
the event take o
n themselves the
 least responsi
bility and vice 
versa.  Morall
y the wielder of
 power appears t
o cause the even
t; physically i
t is those who s
ubmit to the pow
er. But as the m
oral activity is
 inconceivable 
without the phys
"ical, the cause "
of the event is 
neither in the 
one nor in the o
ther but in the 
union of the two
.  Or in other
" words, the conc"
eption of a caus
e is inapplicabl
e to the phenom
ena we are exami
ning.  In the 
last analysis we
 reach the circl
e of infinity—
that final limit
 to which in ev
ery domain of th
ought man’s re
ason arrives if 
it is not playi
ng with the subj
ect. Electricity
" produces heat, "
heat produces e
lectricity. Atom
s attract each o
ther and atoms r
epel one another
.  Speaking of
 the interaction
 of heat and ele
ctricity and of 
"atoms, we
canno"
t say why this o
"ccurs, and we sa"
y that it is so 
because it is i
nconceivable oth
"erwise, because "
it must be so an
d that it is a l
aw. The same ap
plies to histori
cal events. Why 
war and revoluti
on occur we do 
not know. We onl
y know that to p
roduce the one o
r the other acti
"on,
people comb"
ine in a certain
 formation in wh
ich they all tak
"e part, and
we "
say that this is
 so because it i
s unthinkable ot
"herwise, or in o"
ther words that
 it is a law.  
     CHAPTER
 VIII  If hist
ory dealt only w
ith external phe
"nomena, the esta"
blishment of thi
s simple and ob
vious law would 
suffice and we s
hould have finis
hed our argumen
t. But the law o
f history relate
s to man. A part
icle of matter 
cannot tell us t
hat it does not 
feel the law of 
attraction or re
pulsion and tha
t that law is un
"true, but man, w"
ho is the subjec
"t of history,
s"
ays plainly: I a
m free and am th
erefore not subj
ect to the law. 
  The presence 
of the problem o
f man’s free w
"ill, though unex"
"pressed, is
fel"
t at every step 
of history.  A
ll seriously thi
nking historians
 have involuntar
ily encountered 
this question. 
All the contradi
ctions and obscu
rities of histor
y and the false
 path historical
 science has fol
lowed are due so
lely to the lack
 of a solution 
of that question
.  If the will
 of every man we
"re free, that is"
", if each man co"
uld act as he p
"leased, all hist"
ory would be a s
eries of disconn
ected incidents.
  If in a thou
sand years even 
one man in a mil
lion could act f
"reely, that
is,"
" as he chose, it"
 is evident that
 one single free
 act of that man
’s in violati
on of the laws g
overning human a
ction would dest
roy the possibi
lity of the exis
tence of any law
s for the whole 
of humanity.  
If there be a si
ngle law governi
ng the actions o
"f men, free will"
" cannot
exist, "
for then man’s
 will is subject
 to that law.  
 In this contrad
iction lies the 
problem of free 
"will, which from"
 most ancient t
imes has occupie
d the best human
 minds and from 
most ancient ti
mes has been pre
sented in its wh
ole tremendous s
ignificance.  
The problem is t
hat regarding ma
n as a subject o
f observation f
rom whatever poi
nt of view—the
"ological, histor"
"ical, ethical, o"
r philosophic�
�we find a gener
al law of necess
ity to which he 
(like all that 
exists) is subje
ct. But regardin
g him from withi
n ourselves as w
hat we are cons
"cious of, we fee"
l ourselves to b
e free.  This 
consciousness is
 a source of sel
f-cognition quit
e apart from and
 independent of
 reason. Through
 his reason man 
observes himself
", but only
thro"
ugh consciousnes
s does he know h
imself.  Apart
 from consciousn
ess of self no o
bservation or ap
plication of rea
son is conceiva
ble.  To under
"stand, observe, "
and draw conclus
"ions, man must f"
irst of all be 
conscious of him
self as living. 
A man is only co
nscious of himse
lf as a living 
being by the fac
"t that he wills,"
" that is, is con"
scious of his v
olition. But his
 will—which fo
rms the essence 
of his life—ma
n recognizes (a
nd can but recog
nize) as free. 
"
If, observing "
"himself, man see"
s that his will 
is always direct
ed by one and t
he same law (whe
ther he observes
 the necessity o
"f taking
food, "
"using his brain,"
 or anything els
e) he cannot rec
ognize this nev
er-varying direc
tion of his will
 otherwise than 
as a limitation 
of it. Were it 
not free it coul
d not be limited
. A man’s will
 seems to him t
o be limited jus
t because he is 
not conscious of
 it except as fr
ee.  You say: 
I am not free. B
ut I have lifted
 my hand and let
 it fall. Every
one understands 
that this illogi
cal reply is an 
irrefutable dem
onstration of fr
eedom.  That r
eply is the expr
ession of a cons
ciousness that i
s not subject to
 reason.  If 
the consciousnes
s of freedom wer
e not a separate
 and independent
 source of self
-consciousness i
t would be subje
ct to reasoning 
and to experien
"ce, but in fact "
such subjection 
does not exist a
nd is inconceiv
able.  A serie
s of experiments
 and arguments p
roves to every m
"an that he, as
"
an object of obs
"ervation, is sub"
ject to certain 
"laws, and man su"
bmits to them a
nd never resists
 the laws of gra
vity or impermea
bility once he 
has become acqua
inted with them.
 But the same se
ries of experime
nts and argumen
ts proves to him
 that the comple
te freedom of wh
ich he is consc
ious in himself 
"is impossible, a"
nd that his ever
y action depends
 on his organiz
"ation, his chara"
"cter, and the mo"
tives acting upo
n him; yet man 
never submits to
 the deductions 
of these experim
ents and argumen
ts. Having lear
ned from experim
ent and argument
 that a stone fa
"lls
downwards, "
a man indubitabl
y believes this 
and always expec
ts the law that
 he has learned 
to be fulfilled.
  But learning
 just as certain
ly that his will
 is subject to l
"aws, he does
no"
t and cannot bel
ieve this.  Ho
wever often expe
riment and reaso
ning may show a 
man that under t
he same conditi
ons and with the
 same character 
he will do the s
ame thing as be
"fore, yet when u"
nder the same co
nditions and wit
h the same chara
cter he approac
hes for the thou
sandth time the 
action that alwa
ys ends in the 
"same way, he fee"
ls as certainly 
convinced as bef
ore the experime
nt that he can 
act as he please
"s. Every man, sa"
"vage or sage, ho"
wever incontest
ably reason and 
experiment may p
rove to him that
 it is impossib
le to imagine tw
o different cour
ses of action in
 precisely the 
"same conditions,"
 feels that with
out this irratio
nal conception (
which constitut
es the essence o
f freedom) he ca
nnot imagine lif
e. He feels tha
t however imposs
"ible it may be, "
"it is so, for wi"
thout this conce
ption of freedo
m not only would
 he be unable to
 understand life
", but he would
"
be unable to liv
e for a single m
oment.  He cou
"ld not live, bec"
ause all man’s
" efforts, all hi"
s impulses to li
"fe,
are only ef"
forts to increas
e freedom. Wealt
"h and poverty, f"
ame and obscuri
"ty, power and su"
"bordination, str"
ength and weakne
"ss, health and
"
"disease, culture"
" and ignorance, "
work and leisure
", repletion and "
"hunger,
virtue "
"and vice, are on"
ly greater or le
sser degrees of 
freedom.  A ma
n having no free
dom cannot be co
nceived of excep
t as deprived of
 life.  If th
e conception of 
freedom appears 
to reason to be 
a senseless con
tradiction like 
the possibility 
of performing tw
o actions at one
 and the same i
"nstant of time, "
or of an effect 
"without a cause,"
 that only prov
es that consciou
sness is not sub
ject to reason. 
  This unshakab
"le, irrefutable "
consciousness of
" freedom, uncont"
rolled by exper
iment or argumen
"t, recognized by"
 all thinkers an
d felt by everyo
ne without exce
"ption, this cons"
ciousness withou
t which no conce
ption of man is
 possible consti
tutes the other 
side of the ques
tion.  Man is 
the creation of 
"an all-powerful,"
" all-good, and a"
ll-seeing God. 
"What is sin, the"
 conception of w
hich arises from
 the consciousne
ss of man’s f
reedom? That is 
a question for t
heology.  The 
actions of men a
re subject to ge
neral immutable 
laws expressed i
n statistics. W
hat is man’s r
esponsibility to
" society, the co"
nception of whi
ch results from 
the conception o
f freedom? That 
is a question fo
r jurisprudence
.  Man’s act
ions proceed fro
m his innate cha
racter and the m
otives acting u
pon him. What is
 conscience and 
the perception o
f right and wron
g in actions th
at follows from 
the consciousnes
s of freedom? Th
at is a questio
n for ethics.  
 Man in connecti
on with the gene
ral life of huma
nity appears sub
ject to laws wh
ich determine th
at life. But the
 same man apart 
from that conne
ction appears to
 be free. How sh
ould the past li
fe of nations an
d of humanity b
e regarded—as 
the result of th
"e free, or as th"
e result of the
" constrained, ac"
tivity of man? T
hat is a questio
n for history. 
 Only in our se
lf-confident day
 of the populari
zation of knowle
dge—thanks to
 that most power
ful engine of ig
"norance, the dif"
fusion of printe
d matter—has 
the question of 
the freedom of w
ill been put on 
a level on whic
h the question i
tself cannot exi
st. In our time 
the majority of 
 so-called advan
ced people—tha
"t is, the crowd "
of ignoramuses�
�have taken the
 work of the nat
uralists who dea
l with one side 
of the question 
for a solution 
of the whole pro
blem.  They sa
y and write and 
print that the s
oul and freedom 
"do not exist,
f"
or the life of m
an is expressed 
by muscular move
ments and muscul
ar movements ar
e conditioned by
 the activity of
 the nerves; the
 soul and free 
will do not exis
t because at an 
unknown period o
f time we sprang
 from the apes.
" They say this, "
not at all suspe
cting that thous
ands of years a
go that same law
 of necessity wh
ich with such ar
dor they are now
 trying to prov
e by physiology 
and comparative 
zoology was not 
merely acknowle
dged by all the 
religions and al
"l the thinkers, "
but has never b
een denied. They
 do not see that
 the role of the
 natural science
s in this matte
r is merely to s
erve as an instr
ument for the il
lumination of o
ne side of it. F
or the fact that

 of view of obs

 and the will ar

 at some unknown

 only explains f

 the truth admi

f years ago by a
ll the religious
 and philosophi

t from the point
 of view of reas
on man is subje

 necessity; but 
it does not adva
nce by a hair’
s breadth the s
olution of the q
"uestion, which h"
"as another, oppo"
"site, side,
bas"
ed on the consci
ousness of freed
om.  If men de

 made from a han
dful of earth at
 a certain peri

he first case th
e unknown quanti

time,"
 in the second c

uestion of how 
man’s consciou
sness of freedom
 is to be reconc

w of necessity 
to which he is s
ubject cannot be
 solved by compa

"for in a frog, a"

  CHAPTER IX 
 For the soluti
on of the questi
on of free will 
or inevitability
", history
has t"
his advantage ov
er other branche
s of knowledge i
n which the que
stion is dealt w
"ith, that for hi"
story this quest
ion does not ref
er to the essen
ce of man’s fr
ee will but its 
manifestation in
 the past and u
nder certain con
ditions.  In r
egard to this qu
"estion, history "
stands to the ot
her sciences as 
 experimental sc
ience stands to 
abstract science
.  The subject
 for history is 
not man’s will
 itself but our 
presentation of 
 it.  And so f
"or history, the "
insoluble myster
y presented by t
he incompatibil
ity of free will
 and inevitabili
ty does not exis
t as it does fo
"r theology, ethi"
"cs, and philosop"
hy. History surv
eys a presentati
on of man’s l
ife in which the
 union of these 
two contradictio
ns has already 
taken place.  
In actual life e
ach historic eve
"nt, each human a"
"ction, is very c"
learly and defi
nitely understoo
d without any se
nse of contradic
"tion, although
"
each event prese
nts itself as pa
rtly free and pa
rtly compulsory.
  To solve the
 question of how
 freedom and nec
essity are combi
ned and what co
nstitutes the es
sence of these t
"wo conceptions, "
the philosophy 
of history can a
nd should follow
 a path contrary
 to that taken b
y other science
s. Instead of fi
rst defining the
 conceptions of 
freedom and ine
vitability in th
"emselves, and th"
en ranging the p
henomena of life
 under those de
"finitions, histo"
ry should deduce
 a definition of
 the conception
 of freedom and 
inevitability th
emselves from th
e immense quant
ity of phenomena
 of which it is 
cognizant and th
at always appear
 dependent on t
hese two element
s.  Whatever p
resentation of t
he activity of m
any men or of an
 individual we 
"may consider, we"
 always regard i
t as the result 
partly of man’
s free will and
 partly of the l
aw of inevitabil
ity.  Whether 
we speak of the 
migration of the
 peoples and the
 incursions of 
"the barbarians, "
or of the decree
s of Napoleon II
"I, or of someone"
’s action an 
hour ago in choo
sing one directi
on out of severa
"l for his
walk,"
 we are unconsci
ous of any contr
adiction. The de
gree of freedom 
and inevitabili
ty governing the
 actions of thes
e people is clea
rly defined for
 us.  Our conc
eption of the de
gree of freedom 
often varies acc
ording to diffe
rences in the po
int of view from
 which we regard
" the event, but"
 every human act
ion appears to u
s as a certain c
ombination of fr
eedom and inevi
tability. In eve
ry action we exa
mine we see a ce
rtain measure of
 freedom and a 
certain measure 
of inevitability
. And always the
 more freedom w
e see in any act
ion the less ine
vitability do we
" perceive, and
"
the more inevita
bility the less 
freedom.  The 
proportion of fr
eedom to inevita
bility decreases
 and increases 
according to the
 point of view f
rom which the ac
tion is regarded
", but
their rel"
ation is always 
one of inverse p
roportion.  A 
sinking man who 
clutches at anot
her and drowns h
im; or a hungry 
mother exhauste
d by feeding her
" baby, who steal"
s some food; or 
a man trained t
o discipline who
 on duty at the 
word of command 
kills a defensel
ess man—seem 
"less guilty, tha"
"t is, less free "
and more subject
 to the law of 
"necessity, to on"
e who knows the 
circumstances in
 which these peo
ple were placed
", and more free "
to one who does 
not know that th
e man was himsel
"f
drowning, tha"
t the mother was
" hungry, that th"
e soldier was in
" the ranks,
and"
 so on. Similarl
y a man who comm
itted a murder t
wenty years ago 
and has since l
ived peaceably a
nd harmlessly in
 society seems l
ess guilty and 
his action more 
due to the law o
"f inevitability,"
 to someone who 
 considers his a
ction after twen
ty years have el
apsed than to on
e who examined 
it the day after
 it was committe
d. And in the sa
me way every ac
tion of an insan
"e, intoxicated, "
or highly excite
d man appears le
ss free and mor
e inevitable to 
one who knows th
e mental conditi
on of him who c
ommitted the act
"ion, and seems m"
ore free and les
s inevitable to 
one who does no
t know it. In al
l these cases th
e conception of 
freedom is incr
eased or diminis
hed and the conc
eption of compul
sion is corresp
ondingly decreas
"ed or increased,"
 according to th
e point of view 
 from which the 
action is regard
ed. So that the 
greater the conc
eption of neces
sity the smaller
 the conception 
of freedom and v
ice versa.  Re
"ligion, the comm"
on sense of mank
"ind, the science"
 of jurisprudenc
"e,
and history "
itself understan
d alike this rel
ation between ne
cessity and fre
edom.  All cas
es without excep
tion in which ou
r conception of 
freedom and nec
essity is increa
sed and diminish
ed depend on thr
ee consideration
s:  (1) The re
lation to the ex
ternal world of 
the man who comm
its the deeds. 
 (2) His relati
on to time.  (
3) His relation 
to the causes le
ading to the act
ion.  The firs
t consideration 
is the clearness
 of our percepti
on of the man’
s relation to t
he external worl
d and the greate
r or lesser clea
rness of our un
derstanding of t
he definite posi
tion occupied by
 the man in rel
ation to everyth
ing coexisting w
ith him. This is
 what makes it 
evident that a d
rowning man is l
ess free and mor
e subject to nec
essity than one
 standing on dry
" ground, and tha"
t makes the acti
ons of a man cl
osely connected 
with others in a
 thickly populat
"ed district, or "
of one bound by
" family, officia"
"l, or business d"
"uties, seem cert"
ainly less free 
 and more subjec
t to necessity t
han those of a m
an living in sol
itude and seclu
sion.  If we c
onsider a man al
"one, apart from "
his relation to 
everything aroun
"d
him, each act"
ion of his seems
 to us free. But
 if we see his r
elation to anyt
"hing around him,"
 if we see his c
onnection with a
nything whateve
r—with a man w
ho speaks to him
", a book he read"
"s, the work on
"
which he is enga
"ged, even with t"
he air he breath
es or the light 
that falls on t
he things about 
him—we see tha
t each of these 
circumstances h
as an influence 
on him and contr
ols at least som
e side of his ac
tivity. And the
 more we perceiv
e of these influ
ences the more o
ur conception of
 his freedom di
minishes and the
 more our concep
tion of the nece
ssity that weig
hs on him increa
ses.  The seco
nd consideration
 is the more or 
less evident tim
e relation of t
he man to the wo
rld and the clea
rness of our per
ception of the p
lace the man’
s action occupie
s in time. That 
is the ground wh
ich makes the f
all of the first
" man, resulting "
in the productio
n of the human r
"ace,
appear evi"
dently less free
 than a man’s 
entry into marri
age today. It is
 the reason why
 the life and ac
tivity of people
 who lived centu
ries ago and ar
e connected with
 me in time cann
ot seem to me as
 free as the lif
e of a contempo
"rary, the conseq"
uences of which 
are still unknow
n to me.  The 
degree of our co
nception of free
dom or inevitabi
lity depends in 
this respect on
 the greater or 
lesser lapse of 
time between the
 performance of
 the action and 
our judgment of 
it.  If I exam
ine an act I per
formed a moment 
ago in approxima
tely the same c
ircumstances as 
those I am in no
"w, my action app"
ears to me undou
btedly free. Bu
t if I examine a
n act performed 
"a month ago, the"
n being in diff
erent circumstan
"ces, I cannot he"
lp recognizing t
hat if that act 
had not been co
mmitted much tha
t resulted from 
"it—good, agree"
"able, and even
"
essential—woul
d not have taken
 place. If I ref
lect on an actio
n still more re
"mote, ten years "
"ago or more, the"
n the consequenc
es of my action 
 are still plain
er to me and I f
ind it hard to i
magine what woul
d have happened
 had that action
 not been perfor
med. The farther
 I go back in m
"emory, or what i"
s the same thing
 the farther I g
o forward in my 
"
judgment, the m"
ore doubtful bec
omes my belief i
n the freedom of
 my action.  
In history we fi
nd a very simila
r progress of co
nviction concern
ing the part pl
ayed by free wil
l in the general
 affairs of huma
nity. A contemp
orary event seem
s to us to be in
dubitably the do
ing of all the 
known participan
"ts, but with a m"
ore remote event
 we already see 
its inevitable 
results which pr
event our consid
ering anything e
lse possible. A
nd the farther w
e go back in exa
mining events th
e less arbitrary
 do they appear
.  The Austro-
Prussian war app
ears to us undou
btedly the resul
t of the crafty
 conduct of Bism
"arck, and so on."
 The Napoleonic 
wars still seem 
"
to us, though a"
lready questiona
"bly, to be the o"
utcome of their 
heroes’ will.
 But in the Crus
ades we already 
see an event occ
upying its defin
ite place in hi
story and withou
t which we canno
t imagine the mo
dern history of
" Europe, though "
to the chronicle
rs of the Crusad
es that event ap
peared as merel
y due to the wil
l of certain peo
ple. In regard t
o the migration 
 of the peoples 
it does not ente
r anyone’s hea
d today to suppo
se that the ren
ovation of the E
uropean world de
pended on Attila
’s caprice. Th
e farther back 
in history the o
bject of our obs
"ervation lies, t"
he more doubtfu
l does the free 
will of those co
ncerned in the e
vent become and 
 the more manife
st the law of in
evitability.  
The third consid
eration is the d
egree to which w
e apprehend that
 endless chain 
of causation ine
vitably demanded
" by reason, in w"
hich each pheno
menon comprehend
"ed, and therefor"
e man’s every 
"action, must hav"
e its definite 
place as a resul
t of what has go
ne before and as
 a cause of wha
t will follow. 
 The better we 
are acquainted w
ith the physiolo
"gical, psycholog"
"ical, and
histo"
rical laws deduc
ed by observatio
n and by which m
an is controlled
",
and the more "
correctly we per
ceive the physio
"logical, psychol"
"ogical,
and his"
torical causes o
"f the action, an"
d the simpler th
e action we are 
 observing and t
he less complex 
the character an
d mind of the ma
"n in
question, "
the more subject
 to inevitabilit
y and the less f
ree do our acti
ons and those of
 others appear. 
  When we do no
t at all underst
and the cause of
" an action, whet"
"her a
crime, a "
"good action, or "
even one that is
 simply nonmoral
", we ascribe a
"
greater amount o
f freedom to it.
 In the case of 
a crime we most 
urgently demand
 the punishment 
for such an act;
 in the case of 
a virtuous act w
e rate its meri
t most highly. I
n an indifferent
 case we recogni
ze in it more i
"ndividuality, or"
"iginality, and i"
ndependence. But
 if even one of 
 the innumerable
 causes of the a
ct is known to u
s we recognize a
 certain elemen
t of necessity a
nd are less insi
stent on punishm
ent for the crim
"e,
or the ackno"
wledgment of the
 merit of the vi
"rtuous act, or t"
he freedom of t
he apparently or
iginal action. T
hat a criminal w
as reared among 
 malefactors mit
igates his fault
 in our eyes. Th
e self-sacrifice
 of a father or
" mother, or self"
-sacrifice with 
the possibility 
"of a reward, is "
more comprehens
ible than gratui
tous self-sacrif
"ice, and therefo"
re seems less d
eserving of symp
athy and less th
e result of free
 will. The found
er of a sect or
" party, or an in"
"ventor, impresse"
s us less when w
e know how or by
 what the way w
as prepared for 
his activity. If
 we have a large
 range of examp
"les, if our obse"
rvation is const
antly directed t
o seeking the c
orrelation of ca
use and effect i
n people’s act
"ions, their acti"
ons appear to u
s more under com
pulsion and less
 free the more c
orrectly we con
nect the effects
 with the causes
. If we examined
 simple actions 
and had a vast 
number of such a
ctions under obs
"ervation, our co"
nception of the
ir inevitability
 would be still 
greater. The dis
honest conduct o
f the son of a 
dishonest father
", the misconduct"
 of a woman who 
had fallen into
" bad company, a "
drunkard’s rel
apse into drunke
"nness, and so on"
 are actions th
at seem to us le
ss free the bett
er we understand
 their cause. I
f the man whose 
actions we are c
onsidering is on
 a very low stag
e of mental dev
"elopment, like a"
" child, a madman"
", or a simpleton"
"—then,
knowin"
g the causes of 
the act and the 
simplicity of th
e character and 
 intelligence in
" question, we se"
e so large an el
ement of necessi
ty and so littl
e free will that
 as soon as we k
now the cause pr
ompting the acti
on we can foret
ell the result. 
  On these thre
e considerations
 alone is based 
the conception o
f irresponsibil
ity for crimes a
nd the extenuati
ng circumstances
 admitted by al
l legislative co
des. The respons
ibility appears 
greater or less 
 according to ou
r greater or les
ser knowledge of
 the circumstanc
es in which the
 man was placed 
whose action is 
"being judged, an"
d according to 
the greater or l
esser interval o
f time between t
he commission of
 the action and
 its investigati
"on, and accordin"
g to the greater
 or lesser unde
rstanding of the
 causes that led
 to the action. 
      CHAPT
ER X  Thus our
 conception of f
ree will and ine
vitability gradu
ally diminishes 
 or increases ac
cording to the g
reater or lesser
 connection with
 the external w
"orld, the greate"
r or lesser remo
"teness of time, "
and the greater
 or lesser depen
dence on the cau
ses in relation 
to which we con
template a man�
�s life.  So t
hat if we examin
e the case of a 
man whose connec
tion with the e
xternal world is
" well known, whe"
re the time betw
een the action a
nd its examinat
"ion is great, an"
d where the caus
es of the action
 are most acces
"sible, we get th"
e conception of 
a maximum of ine
vitability and a
 minimum of fre
e will. If we ex
amine a man litt
le dependent on 
external condit
"ions, whose acti"
on was performed
" very recently, "
and the causes o
f whose action 
are beyond our k
"en, we get the c"
onception of a m
inimum of inevi
tability and a m
aximum of freedo
m.  In neither
 case—however 
we may change ou
"r point of view,"
 however plain 
we may make to o
urselves the con
nection between 
the man and the 
"external
world,"
 however inacces
sible it may be 
"to us, however l"
ong or short the
 period of time
", however intell"
igible or incomp
rehensible the c
auses of the ac
tion may be—ca
n we ever concei
ve either comple
te freedom or c
omplete necessit
y.  (1) To wha
tever degree we 
may imagine a ma
n to be exempt f
rom the influen
ce of the extern
"al world, we nev"
er get a concept
ion of freedom 
in space. Every 
human action is 
inevitably condi
tioned by what s
urrounds him an
d by his own bod
y. I lift my arm
 and let it fall
. My action seem
s to me free; b
ut asking myself
 whether I could
 raise my arm in
 every directio
"n, I see that I "
raised it in the
 direction in wh
ich there was l
east obstruction
 to that action 
either from thin
gs around me or 
from the constr
uction of my own
 body. I chose o
ne out of all th
e possible dire
ctions because i
n it there were 
fewest obstacles
. For my action 
 to be free it w
as necessary tha
t it should enco
unter no obstacl
es. To conceive
 of a man being 
free we must ima
gine him outside
" space, which is"
 evidently impo
ssible.  (2) H
owever much we a
pproximate the t
ime of judgment 
to the time of t
"he
deed, we nev"
er get a concept
ion of freedom i
n time. For if I
 examine an act
ion committed a 
second ago I mus
t still recogniz
e it as not bei
"ng free, for it "
is irrevocably l
inked to the mom
ent at which it 
was committed. 
Can I lift my ar
"m? I lift it, bu"
t ask myself: co
uld I have abst
ained from lifti
ng my arm at the
 moment that has
 already passed?
 To convince my
self of this I d
o not lift it th
e next moment. B
ut I am not now
 abstaining from
 doing so at the
 first moment wh
en I asked the 
question. Time h
as gone by which
 I could not det
"ain, the arm I t"
hen lifted is n
o longer the sam
e as the arm I n
ow refrain from 
"lifting,
nor is"
 the air in whic
h I lifted it th
e same that now 
surrounds me. Th
e moment in whi
ch the first mov
ement was made i
"s irrevocable, a"
nd at that mome
nt I could make 
only one movemen
"t, and whatever "
movement I made 
 would be the on
ly one. That I d
id not lift my a
rm a moment late
r does not prov
e that I could h
ave abstained fr
om lifting it th
en. And since I 
 could make only
 one movement at
 that single mom
"ent of time, it "
could not have 
been any other. 
To imagine it as
" free, it is nec"
essary to imagin
e it in the pre
"sent, on the bou"
ndary between th
e past and the f
uture—that is
", outside time, "
which is impossi
ble.  (3) Howe
ver much the dif
ficulty of under
standing the cau
ses may be incr
"eased, we never "
reach a concepti
on of complete f
"reedom, that is,"
 an absence of 
cause. However i
naccessible to u
s may be the cau
se of the expre
ssion of will in
" any action, our"
 own or another�
"��s, the first d"
emand of reason
 is the assumpti
on of and search
" for a cause, fo"
r without a cau
se no phenomenon
 is conceivable.
 I raise my arm 
to perform an ac
tion independen
tly of any cause
", but my wish to"
 perform an acti
on without a ca
use is the cause
 of my action. 
 But even if—
imagining a man 
quite exempt fro
m all influences
", examining
onl"
y his momentary 
action in the pr
"esent, unevoked "
by any cause—w
e were to admit
 so infinitely s
mall a remainder
 of inevitabilit
y as equaled ze
"ro, we should ev"
en then not have
 arrived at the 
conception of co
mplete freedom 
"in man, for a be"
ing uninfluenced
 by the external
" world, standing"
 outside of tim
e and independen
"t of cause, is n"
o longer a man. 
  In the same w
ay we can never 
imagine the acti
on of a man quit
e devoid of fre
edom and entirel
y subject to the
 law of inevitab
ility.  (1) Ho
wever we may inc
rease our knowle
dge of the condi
tions of space 
in which man is 
"situated, that k"
nowledge can nev
"er be complete, "
for the number 
of those conditi
ons is as infini
te as the infini
ty of space. And
 therefore so l
ong as not all t
he conditions in
fluencing men ar
"e defined,
ther"
e is no complete
 inevitability b
ut a certain mea
sure of freedom 
 remains.  (2)
 However we may 
prolong the peri
od of time betwe
en the action we
 are examining 
and the judgment
" upon it, that p"
eriod will be fi
"nite, while
tim"
"e is infinite, a"
nd so in this re
spect too there 
can never be abs
olute inevitabi
lity.  (3) How
ever accessible 
may be the chain
 of causation of
" any action, we"
 shall never kno
w the whole chai
n since it is en
"dless, and so ag"
ain we never re
ach absolute ine
vitability.  B
"ut besides this,"
" even if, admitt"
ing the remainin
g minimum of fre
edom to equal z
"ero, we assumed "
in some given ca
se—as for inst
ance in that of 
"a
dying man, an"
" unborn babe, or"
 an idiot—comp
lete absence of 
"freedom, by
so "
doing we should 
destroy the very
 conception of m
an in the case w
e are examining
", for as soon as"
 there is no fre
edom there is al
so no man. And 
so the conceptio
n of the action 
of a man subject
 solely to the l
aw of inevitabi
lity without any
 element of free
dom is just as i
mpossible as th
e conception of 
a man’s comple
tely free action
.  And so to i
magine the actio
n of a man entir
ely subject to t
he law of inevi
tability without
" any freedom, we"
 must assume the
 knowledge of an
 infinite numbe
r of space relat
"ions, an infinit"
ely long period 
"of time,
and an"
 infinite series
 of causes.  T
o imagine a man 
perfectly free a
nd not subject t
o the law of in
"evitability, we "
must imagine him
" all alone, beyo"
"nd space, beyond"
" time,
and free"
 from dependence
 on cause.  In
" the first case,"
 if inevitabilit
y were possible 
without freedom 
 we should have 
reached a defini
tion of inevitab
ility by the law
s of inevitabil
"ity itself, that"
" is, a mere form"
 without content
.  In the seco
"nd case, if free"
dom were possibl
e without inevit
ability we shou
ld have arrived 
at unconditioned
 freedom beyond 
"space, time, and"
"
cause, which b"
y the fact of it
s being uncondit
ioned and unlimi
ted would be no
"thing, or mere c"
ontent without f
orm.  We shoul
d in fact have r
eached those two
 fundamentals of
 which man’s 
whole outlook on
 the universe is
 constructed—t
he incomprehensi
ble essence of 
"life, and the la"
ws defining that
 essence.  Rea
son says: (1) sp
ace with all the
 forms of matter
 that give it v
isibility is inf
"inite, and canno"
t be imagined ot
herwise. (2) Tim
e is infinite m
otion without a 
moment of rest a
nd is unthinkabl
e otherwise. (3
) The connection
 between cause a
nd effect has no
 beginning and c
an have no end.
  Consciousnes
s says: (1) I al
"one am, and all "
that exists is b
"ut me,
conseque"
ntly I include s
pace. (2) I meas
ure flowing time
 by the fixed m
oment of the pre
sent in which al
one I am conscio
us of myself as 
"living,
consequ"
ently I am outsi
de time. (3) I a
"m beyond cause, "
for I feel mysel
f to be the cau
se of every mani
festation of my 
life.  Reason 
gives expression
 to the laws of 
inevitability. C
onsciousness gi
ves expression t
o the essence of
 freedom.  Fre
edom not limited
 by anything is 
the essence of l
"ife, in man’s"
 consciousness. 
Inevitability wi
thout content is
 man’s reason 
in its three fo
rms.  Freedom 
is the thing exa
mined. Inevitabi
lity is what exa
mines. Freedom 
is the content. 
Inevitability is
 the form.  On
ly by separating
 the two sources
" of cognition, r"
elated to one an
other as form t
"o content, do we"
 get the mutuall
y exclusive and 
separately inco
mprehensible con
ceptions of free
dom and inevitab
ility.  Only b
y uniting them d
o we get a clear
 conception of m
an’s life.  
Apart from these
 two concepts wh
ich in their uni
on mutually defi
ne one another 
as form and cont
"ent, no concepti"
on of life is po
ssible.  All t
hat we know of t
he life of man i
s merely a certa
in relation of f
ree will to ine
"vitability, that"
" is, of consciou"
sness to the law
s of reason.  
All that we know
 of the external
 world of nature
 is only a certa
in relation of 
the forces of na
ture to inevitab
"ility, or of the"
 essence of lif
e to the laws of
 reason.  The 
great natural fo
rces lie outside
 us and we are n
ot conscious of 
 them; we call t
hose forces grav
"itation, inertia"
", electricity, a"
"nimal
force, an"
"d so on, but we "
are conscious of
 the force of li
fe in man and w
e call that free
dom.  But just
 as the force of
" gravitation, in"
comprehensible i
n itself but fe
"lt by every man,"
 is understood b
y us only to the
 extent to which
 we know the la
ws of inevitabil
ity to which it 
is subject (from
 the first know
ledge that all b
odies have weigh
"t, up to Newton�"
"��s law), so too"
 the force of f
"ree will, incomp"
rehensible in it
self but of whic
h everyone is c
"onscious, is int"
elligible to us 
only in as far a
s we know the la
ws of inevitabi
lity to which it
 is subject (fro
m the fact that 
"every man dies,"
 up to the knowl
edge of the most
 complex economi
c and historic l
aws).  All kno
wledge is merely
 a bringing of t
his essence of l
ife under the l
aws of reason. 
 Man’s free w
ill differs from
 every other for
ce in that man i
s directly cons
"cious of it, but"
 in the eyes of 
reason it in no 
way differs from
 any other forc
e. The forces of
" gravitation, el"
"ectricity, or ch"
emical affinity
 are only distin
guished from one
 another in that
 they are diffe
rently defined b
y reason. Just s
o the force of m
an’s free will
 is distinguish
ed by reason fro
m the other forc
es of nature onl
y by the defini
tion reason give
"s it. Freedom, a"
part from necess
"ity, that is,
a"
part from the la
ws of reason tha
"t define it, dif"
fers in no way f
rom gravitation
", or heat, or th"
e force that mak
es things grow; 
"for reason,
it "
is only a moment
ary undefinable 
sensation of lif
e.  And as the
 undefinable ess
ence of the forc
e moving the hea
"venly bodies,
t"
he undefinable e
ssence of the fo
rces of heat and
" electricity, or"
 of chemical af
"finity, or of th"
"e vital force, f"
orms the content
" of
astronomy, "
"physics, chemist"
"ry, botany, zool"
"ogy, and so on, "
just in the sam
e way does the f
orce of free wil
l form the conte
nt of history. 
But just as the 
subject of every
 science is the 
manifestation of
 this unknown e
ssence of life w
hile that essenc
e itself can onl
y be the subjec
t of metaphysics
", even the manif"
estation of the 
force of free wi
ll in human bei
"ngs in space, in"
" time, and in de"
pendence on caus
e forms the sub
"ject of history,"
 while free will
 itself is the s
ubject of metap
hysics.  In th
e experimental s
ciences what we 
know we call the
 laws of inevit
"ability, what is"
 unknown to us w
e call vital for
ce. Vital force 
is only an expr
ession for the u
nknown remainder
 over and above 
what we know of
 the essence of 
life.  So also
 in history what
 is known to us 
we call laws of 
"inevitability,
"
what is unknown 
we call free wil
l. Free will is 
for history only
 an expression 
for the unknown 
remainder of wha
t we know about 
the laws of hum
an life.    
  CHAPTER XI 
 History examin
es the manifesta
tions of man’s
 free will in co
nnection with t
he external worl
d in time and in
 dependence on c
"ause, that is, i"
t defines this 
freedom by the l
"aws of reason, a"
nd so history is
 a science only
 in so far as th
is free will is 
defined by those
 laws.  The re
cognition of man
’s free will a
s something capa
ble of influenci
ng historical e
"vents, that is, "
as not subject t
"o laws, is the s"
ame for history
 as the recognit
ion of a free fo
rce moving the h
eavenly bodies 
would be for ast
ronomy.  That 
assumption would
 destroy the pos
sibility of the 
existence of law
"s,
that is, of "
any science what
ever. If there i
s even a single 
body moving fre
"ely, then the la"
ws of Kepler and
 Newton are nega
tived and no co
nception of the 
movement of the 
heavenly bodies 
any longer exist
s. If any singl
e action is due 
"to free will, th"
en not a single 
historical law 
"can exist, nor a"
ny conception of
 historical even
ts.  For histo
"ry, lines exist "
of the movement 
"of human wills, "
one end of whic
h is hidden in t
he unknown but a
t the other end 
of which a cons
ciousness of man
’s will in the
 present moves i
"n space, time, a"
nd dependence o
n cause.  The 
more this field 
of motion spread
s out before our
" eyes, the more"
 evident are the
 laws of that mo
vement. To disco
ver and define t
hose laws is th
e problem of his
tory.  From th
e standpoint fro
m which the scie
nce of history n
ow regards its 
subject on the p
ath it now follo
"ws, seeking the "
causes of events
 in man’s fre
"e will, a scient"
ific enunciation
 of those laws i
"s impossible,
f"
or however man�
�s free will may
" be restricted, "
as soon as we re
cognize it as a
 force not subje
"ct to law, the e"
xistence of law 
becomes impossi
ble.  Only by 
reducing this el
ement of free wi
ll to the infini
"tesimal, that
i"
"s, by regarding "
it as an infinit
ely small quanti
"ty, can we convi"
nce ourselves o
f the absolute i
naccessibility o
"f the causes, an"
d then instead 
of seeking cause
"s, history will "
take the discove
ry of laws as i
ts problem.  T
he search for th
ese laws has lon
g been begun and
 the new methods
 of thought whi
ch history must 
adopt are being 
worked out simul
taneously with 
the self-destruc
tion toward whic
h—ever dissect
ing and dissecti
ng the causes o
f phenomena—th
e old method of 
history is movin
g.  All human 
sciences have tr
aveled along tha
t path. Arriving
 at infinitesim
"als, mathematics"
", the most exact"
" of sciences, ab"
andons the proc
ess of analysis 
and enters on th
e new process of
 the integration
"
of unknown, in"
"finitely small, "
quantities. Aban
doning the conce
"ption
of cause,"
 mathematics see
"ks law, that is,"
 the property co
mmon to all unk
"nown, infinitely"
" small, elements"
.  In another 
form but along t
he same path of 
reflection the o
ther sciences h
ave proceeded. W
hen Newton enunc
iated the law of
 gravity he did 
not say that th
e sun or the ear
th had a propert
y of attraction;
 he said that al
l bodies from t
he largest to th
e smallest have 
the property of 
attracting one 
"another, that is"
", leaving aside "
the question of 
the cause of the
 movement of th
"e bodies, he exp"
ressed the prope
rty common to al
l bodies from t
he infinitely la
rge to the infin
itely small. The
 same is done by
 the natural sc
iences: leaving 
aside the questi
"on of cause, the"
y seek for laws
. History stands
 on the same pat
h. And if histor
y has for its ob
ject the study 
of the movement 
of the nations a
nd of humanity a
nd not the narr
ation of episode
s in the lives o
"f individuals, i"
"t too, setting
"
aside the concep
"tion of cause, s"
hould seek the l
aws common to al
l the inseparab
ly interconnecte
d infinitesimal 
elements of free
 will.     
 CHAPTER XII  
 From the time t
he law of Copern
icus was discove
"red and proved, "
the mere recogn
ition of the fac
t that it was no
t the sun but th
e earth that mov
es sufficed to 
destroy the whol
e cosmography of
 the ancients. B
y disproving th
at law it might 
have been possib
le to retain the
 old conception 
of the movement
"s of the bodies,"
 but without dis
"proving it, it w"
ould seem impos
sible to continu
e studying the P
tolemaic worlds.
 But even after 
 the discovery o
f the law of Cop
ernicus the Ptol
emaic worlds wer
e still studied
 for a long time
.  From the ti
me the first per
son said and pro
ved that the num
ber of births o
r of crimes is s
ubject to mathem
"atical laws, and"
 that this or th
at mode of gove
rnment is determ
ined by certain 
geographical and
 economic condi
"tions, and that "
certain relation
s of population 
to soil produce 
 migrations of p
"eoples, the foun"
dations on which
 history had bee
n built were de
stroyed in their
 essence.  By 
refuting these n
ew laws the form
er view of histo
ry might have be
en retained; bu
t without refuti
ng them it would
 seem impossible
 to continue st
udying historic 
events as the re
sults of man’s
 free will. For 
if a certain mo
de of government
 was established
 or certain migr
ations of peopl
es took place in
 consequence of 
such and such ge
"ographic,
ethno"
"graphic, or econ"
"omic conditions,"
 then the free w
ill of those in
dividuals who ap
pear to us to ha
ve established t
hat mode of gove
rnment or occas
ioned the migrat
ions can no long
er be regarded a
s the cause.  
And yet the form
er history conti
nues to be studi
ed side by side 
with the laws o
"f statistics, ge"
"ography, politic"
"al economy, comp"
arative philolog
"y,
and geology,"
 which directly 
contradict its a
ssumptions.  T
he struggle betw
een the old view
s and the new wa
s long and stubb
ornly fought ou
t in physical ph
ilosophy. Theolo
gy stood on guar
d for the old v
iews and accused
 the new of viol
ating revelation
. But when truth
"
conquered, the"
ology establishe
d itself just as
 firmly on the n
ew foundation. 
  Just as prolo
nged and stubbor
n is the struggl
e now proceeding
 between the ol
d and the new co
nception of hist
"ory, and theolog"
y in the same wa
y stands on gua
rd for the old v
"iew, and accuses"
 the new view of
 subverting rev
elation.  In t
he one case as i
"n the other, on "
both sides the s
truggle provokes
 passion and st
ifles truth. On 
the one hand the
re is fear and r
egret for the l
oss of the whole
 edifice constru
cted through the
" ages, on the ot"
her is the pass
ion for destruct
ion.  To the m
en who fought ag
ainst the rising
 truths of physi
"cal philosophy,"
 it seemed that 
if they admitted
 that truth it w
ould destroy fai
"th in
God, in t"
he creation of t
"he firmament, an"
d in the miracle
 of Joshua the 
son of Nun. To t
he defenders of 
the laws of Cope
rnicus and Newto
"n, to
Voltaire "
"for example, it "
seemed that the 
laws of astronom
y destroyed rel
"igion, and he ut"
ilized the law o
f gravitation as
 a weapon agains
t religion.  
Just so it now s
eems as if we ha
ve only to admit
 the law of ine
"vitability, to d"
estroy the conce
ption of the sou
"l, of good and e"
"vil,
and all th"
e institutions o
f state and chur
ch that have bee
n built up on t
hose conceptions
".

So too, lik"
e Voltaire in hi
"s time, uninvite"
d defenders of t
he law of inevi
tability today u
se that law as a
 weapon against 
"religion, though"
 the law of ine
vitability in hi
"story, like the "
law of Copernicu
"s in
astronomy,"
 far from destro
"ying, even stren"
gthens the found
ation on which 
the institutions
 of state and ch
urch are erected
.  As in the q
uestion of astro
"nomy then, so in"
 the question of
" history
now, t"
he whole differe
nce of opinion i
s based on the r
ecognition or n
onrecognition of
 something absol
"ute, serving as "
the measure of v
isible phenomen
a. In astronomy 
it was the immov
ability of the e
"arth, in history"
 it is the inde
pendence of pers
onality—free w
ill.  As with 
astronomy the di
fficulty of reco
gnizing the moti
on of the earth 
 lay in abandoni
ng the immediate
 sensation of th
e earth’s fixi
ty and of the m
otion of the pla
"nets, so in hist"
ory the difficul
ty of recognizin
g the subjectio
n of personality
 to the laws of 
"space, time, and"
 cause lies in 
renouncing the d
irect feeling of
 the independenc
e of one’s own
 personality. B
ut as in astrono
my the new view 
said: “It is t
rue that we do 
not feel the mov
ement of the ear
"th, but by admit"
ting its immobil
ity we arrive a
"t absurdity, whi"
le by admitting 
its motion (whic
h we do not fee
l) we arrive at 
"laws,” so also"
 in history the 
new view says: �
��It is true th
at we are not co
nscious of our d
"ependence, but b"
y admitting our 
 free will we ar
rive at absurdit
"y, while by admi"
tting our depend
ence on the ext
"ernal world, on "
"time, and on cau"
"se, we arrive at"
 laws.”  In 
the first case i
t was necessary 
to renounce the 
consciousness of
 an unreal immo
bility in space 
and to recognize
 a motion we did
 not feel; in t
he present case 
it is similarly 
necessary to ren
ounce a freedom 
 that does not e
"xist, and to rec"
ognize a depende
nce of which we 
are not conscio
us.
